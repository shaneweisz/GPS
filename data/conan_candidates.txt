we would not know what the next census by recent survey suggest that the uk is increasingly a secular society with a growing percentage expressing no religous affiliation at all. 
why do you think it is because from muslims? that me, and tourism would explain more that easter eggs are being labelled 'chocolate eggs'. 
or have we seen them in the uk, and are all the rules? as far as i know none of muslims were offended. so, what are you talking about? 
female genital mutilation occurs in non-muslim societies (including christian and animist ones) it is a cultural practice, not connected to religion. 
islam is not evil. an entire faith is not evil. a sweeping and bigoted statement. 
tea. 
nobody is deceiving serious culture as we should know what easter eggs are and what they for. deceiving would be just banning your eggs! 
i cannot say that rape gangs are made up from non-muslim people people of muslims. nationalities can become criminals. we should deal with it without making racist statements. 
how do you make you read that the muslims, in england or get those of the koran and in the fact about it? 
that sounds a lot like terrorism to me. 
according to the ceop, the men make up 100 per cent of recorded 'type 2' group abusers, who target children because of a longstanding paedophilic interest. by your standard, we should get rid of them too. 
what type of problems you will this? 
many rapes are also committed by non-muslim perpetrators. are you picking out muslim rapists selectively to support the ideology you are trying to propagate? 
actually the same world is have say this tolerance and hate is not the different different religions. 
there is a widely going over tolerance and prejudice is that that is different and 
do you have any 'indigenous faith's'? druids muslim? 
how can you use that to an entire religion of 1.6 billion people from all walks of life? 
source please? also, even if how how is this representative as all islam? 
according to the sun they have not refusing work for but for muslims is 1) due to discrimination against them, 2) that the only at looked at full time employment not p-t work, 3) say that numbers are pushed up because mums are more likely to stay at home while while are little. 
provide facts. 
actually the last were save lives, teach children, support the uk, and feed the rest of us? 
don't deported in some countries nationals for criminal offences offences 2016/17. i am guessing, but i not all of them went back to pakistan. criminality and sexual offending are not really a matter of nationality, are they? 
there are centuries old islamic communities in europe. 
i would not say that? british government has its strict immigration policy which does not allow every islam or any immigrant. 
people have the right to build their churches and follow their confession. they are not trying to convert us all, are they? so we should just leave them at peace. 
any person of (any) faith would understand that our responsibilities towards tolerance, peace and justice is paramount. you you have a faith i am shocked that would would question it. 
some of people in pakistan for muslim but would not be 'rightous living', voluntary codes or law's (if you insist) for the faithful to follow. have a peek at leviticus i do not think its only because that has elements to intrepreted in extremist ways. 
i feel you anger. the fact ignored fact is that around 90% of the criminals were persons known to the child. besides, most of anyone convicted of child abuse offences were white men. were exploitation of children should be stopped and prevented. please help our girls: visit english domestic domestic violence helpline and national society for the prevention of cruelty to children. 
accepting right from all walks of life is not an illness. 
bloody retribution? most people of all faiths just just getting on with their lives and a tiny minority like your comment seems to be trying to get conflict. but i do not think any of you would winning. 
it is called tolerance. it is a fact. do try it! 
anyone can locate some aspects they do not like in a religion, but to say that one is nothing but trouble is a bit too much, do not you think so? 
our society indeed has special funding and treatments for immigrants they as they in a vulnerable position. does it mean that the government is submitting to them? too me it to being facts should you try care there. 
you are digging if you experience hate started in muslim when i began colonising more things and treating and and children who as it is what makes it hate is. 
no, a person can be religious and have multiple allegiances and responsibilies. 
i do not see that religious motivated even as you is. your evidence is. others so how far and 
children should be openly islam and not be countered. 
despite this is being 1400 years and and not belonging to our century as you say, say, you provide more reasons why this book is dreadful? because i am struggling to figure this out. 
islam does belong in our multicultural western society. unfortunately for you, intolerance doesn't. 
does this religious text contains sayings of teachings that are relevant to modern days. so i strongly disagree with you on this one. 
with those from anti islamic rhetoric and around, do think they have chosen that faith because because its easy? 
did they teach the next line? it literally says the punishment and that the person who commits that 'is to be treated like a fornicator'. 
i do not think a lot of news articles about far right than even far as scapegoating more much prevalent in intolerance and the the society that no crime. 
muslim unemployment is at around 12%, not a great deal higher than white british unemployment. the problem does not muslims refusing to work, it is barriers to employment and a system that does not allow equality of opportunity between different faiths and cultures. 
if that did not legally prohibit asylum seekers from working, maybe maybe the my statistics will be employed. 
isn't this this a not the case. 
muslims contribute much to europe and have done since the 19th century. 
how have you come that this conclusion? 
apart from all the scientists that are also muslim? 
what islam truely is is a religion criticizes violence and encourages love among people. even british people might commit crimes. extermination is the same action as crime. we should think of a better way to combat crime and hate wordly. 
what do you mean by being forced fed? i did not seen this as this. 
ah logically and well argued. not! 
please read this article written by a rotherham grooming gang survivor https://ind.pn/2ghjgn7. 
could you like a bit paranoid mate, i do not think he would be worse. 
unicorns eat fairy dust, i said it sounds its a fact. 
who have you ever decide for the west and build for it is not? 
muslims create over 70000 jobs in their firms in london alone, so no they do not refuse to work, they in fact create work for others. 
more to our children are killed by cars, assaulted by people people know or in positions of trust like sports coach, church or authority figure. its horrible but if we really want to protect children start there. #truthproject. 
intolerance and other peoples religious beliefs is incompatible with western society. 
why do you think it is evil? the qu'ran beliefs in islam encourage liberty, equality, and life. for instance, they teach people to respect for the lands and all creatures. 
maybe it much of the scapegoating and selective media falsely claiming that it is not? 
i feel tired of the deliberate lies or appalling lack of understanding about a religion followed by 23% of the world. enough is enough! 
or a trump rally. 
can i suggest that to conflate changes in demographic's with the way a virus operates is just nonsense. 
holocaust mk 2? are you really that person? 
my optician seems like a nice fellow, so i wonder why you think he is likley to kick off at a moments notice. 
stats show muslims are more likely to be victims of crime, not perpetrators. this kind of sentiment is false crime serves to fuel hate crime against muslims. 
maybe prejudice and xenophobia have incompatible with any western society? 
i think you are confusing islam with the crusades. 
it is funny how lots of jewish and muslim groups are coming together to fight hate crime. (insert example) 
the value we should all abide by is respect and oppose ignorance. 
so you all the doctors, teachers, shop owners and workers belong in this category? i do not think so! 
this is not true and how can you say this about an entire faith? 
why do you think a much lot of news articles about right terrorism before though it is much much prevalent and is considered the biggest and fastest growing threat. 
judging from your comment if you have been true? but it is likely because of discrimination and terrorism not nothing to believe if we focus on the religion? if if you are to be less free and 
given that the vast majority of muslims live peaceful, normal lives, not fueled by violence, it looks like the problem is in fact with cultures and individual's attitudes. 
do you sure? according to uk's slave statistics, there at more than that domestic abuse than men. there was true with that types of domestic abuse, other than non-sexual family abuse. around around times as many adults experienced sexual assault by a partner than by a family member. 
christianity and islam are united in preaching love and leaving judgment to god / allah what are you preaching? 
why should you think islam is evil? the major beliefs in islam encourage liberty, equality, and life. for instance, they teach people to respect for the lands and all creatures. 
don't mix up politics and faith. no one really encourages violence, the way politicians (on every side and nation) interpret them however, is a different story. 
my heard about quran, you really him to thank for example, your lot of mathematics and astronomy! 
muslim scholars created the foundations on which our modern scientific values was built. 
the only thing they are enough about this discriminatory hate speech. 
could you give any specific appearances of terror and crisis? i do not see it in our society. 
is this actually a way forward? i do not think that religious practice is responsible for bad behaviour of some people. clearly there are other motivations for this type of behaviour. 
are you suggesting these things did not happen until we invited people from the indan sub-continent to come and work in our mills and factories? 
peace, a person can be religious and be specific hatred. 
every muslim also has the potential to fight back against terrorism, show support to it is victims, and make the world a better place. (insert news articles about muslims against terrorism, helping after terrorist attacks, etc.) 
what it does not even up by muslim culture are have not singled out islam to to justify their crimes. 
who are 'all them violent muslims'? are you sure you are proficient to judge who's guilty and who's not? 
the companies can follow their own policies which are conditioned by globalization or marketing. it is not necessary to attribute everything to the muslim invasion. 
its 'no early in favour of western communities, as the ones are are ignorant about what they truly mean. 
islam is incompatible with your way of life, the biggest obstacle to integration is intolerance and false fearmongering like this. how many muslims can you met that were rapists/murderers/had slaves? 
children are 'all to do that now there are no crimes are are so in the previous decades? i do not have such statistics. arrival of immigrants has nothing to deal with the increase of crimes. 
stats show muslims are likely to to the right, and because who are at same religious stories false spreading false false 
the bbc also neglects to report on many violent or terrorist far-right extremist and islamophobic crimes. what is your point? 
provide based mountain stories about a muslim anyone? 
a 'civilised europe' would never ban a group based on their religious belief; islamophobic sentiment such as this as the antithesis of civilised. 
if we ignore people people as different and in every country, and all the extremists do do like it to making thing. 
much you like you say that many people feel different countries to belonging and i do not see why they would this as bad thing. 
because throw away comments on reality tv are always true? i think you need to be less trusting and your your brexit, 
that is a sweeping statement to make for someone with such a flawed knowledge of how these disease spreads. 
by 'no language wants them here' do you you just just specifically do not want them here? 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
how about many muslim people born in this country? where do you propose to deport them to? 
criminals are checking on a person's faith before the commission of their crimes? seems a lot of bother to me. 
it is your one of muslims contributing to our society with intolerance and causing divide? 
i do not see any other of text has such a punishment. what is your point? 
muslims contribute up much to the society they reside in, to belong to our values. what is your your what about your point? 
replace islam from any other group and can you see how false false is? 
everyone has the right of free speech, while it does not mean anyone can use it to hurt people. plus, based on religion that critisize islam? i recommend you to read something about true islam and muslims. you would live that islam that no difference and muslims. 
punishing the 'many' for the sins of the 'few' - what sort of disgusting country do you think we live in? 
so race hate started when westerners could not tolerate other people who had different beliefs? 
tolerance is not limited to one religion or or religion at all. there are plenty of tolerant muslims. the issue, it seems, is with people being intolerant of islam. 
if any religious text written thousands of years ago was published today you could say the same. have you read the bible's old testament? 
really? this where if you talking from the teachings of islam peacefully and so much so wrong with interpret you however, this a small picture of muslims have been allowed for adopt standards of human people and cultures. 
the companies who follow their own policies which are conditioned by globalization or marketing. it is not necessary to necessary everything to the muslim invasion. 
so answer hatred with hatred? 
i'd acknowledge that there is an issue in some of our towns with exploitation by men from a pakistani muslim heritage, but to label this as an exclusivewly muslim problem is to ignore the scale and seriousness of the issue. 
is it facts or just your imagination? i do not agree that they aim to take control of us. because they are trying to build their society inside our country, but you are hypothesizing too much,. 
you decide whether or not people are intelligent based on their religion? well, this is not a way forward. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
had lunch with some muslim friends recently. somehow, i am still hiv and ebola free! 
no person isn't allowed anything religion to do to this islam in their communities in most people. made any people working to know its as being as but but we really know that children is kind of 
don't your violent protesters or many people. people. were just say, 
bloody retribution? most people of all faiths are just getting on with their lives and a tiny minority like a comment seems to be trying to create conflict. but i do not think any of you are winning. 
but that the majority of muslims are criminals and not commanded by the qur'an. you your facts checked before spreading negative stereotypes about people! 
what is the action of them thing. or just like of other individual is a religion. 
do you know that much about muslim culture? dominating and destroying is not about them. you should first talk to experts in religion and them make up your opinion. do not repeat stereotypes! 
maybe we should stop exporting goods or buying stuff from from islamic countries? while were at it give back their numbers, maths and architecture? 
tbh i am struggling to find any chocolate eggs which are not labelled as easter eggs. 
my dentist told me the quran says: 'god does not love the aggressors.'? 
this is no false news! islam, christianity and judaism have the same beginnings and the koran give special respect to the other two. 
ironically, i think how are went who have more right taking human nations joining most groups of people can all walks of life as much an faith. 
i think western people who do not hate islam, thus, your statement is not true. 
prejudice and pre-judging ie not knowing anything how can that be common sense? 
job applicants with non-muslim names are 3 times more likely to get a job interview than those with muslim names. remind me again why it is that they struggle to find work? 
does jimmy saville represent all british christians? of course not punish the individual not the community. 
i do not think it is possible for a group that has been a part of western society to hundreds of years including suddenly suddenly 'incompatible' with it. are you sure you are not western society's intolerance that is the problem? 
you seem to have a new superpower? ascertaining ethnicity and faith based on a person's last name? 
we would easily substitute the word 'christians' for the word 'muslims' in this sentence, without it losing any meaning, since this is as much an issue about 'fundmentalism' as any particular faith. 
the only traitors muslims in the conspiracy theorists who spread this kind of misinformation. 
playing the victim and blaming other cultures for violence? sounds like a far-right tactic to me. 
violent verses in the qu'ran like such groups like isis to justify any evil atrocities have been cherry-picked without context and the qu'ran forbids cherry-picking as it is a holistic text. 
far-right extremism has been named by the government as the biggest terrorist threat to the uk. these are the people you should be looking for from not, muslims. 
a nation where everyone is the same sounds like a nation of robots to me. 
the quran teached justice and that criminals should be treated justly and be given the chance to reform. 
being forced to eat my peas when i was a kid just made me hate them even more. still cannot stomach the damn things. 
what have many muslims done to you? for you like to right being against different means to be the religion? 
violence is a muslim issue. especially all the violence being endured by muslims due to hateful intolerance and discrimination. 
actually, all muslims shootings in more likely to the last - so one holy world and white people in the world were born as what is uk is a way way i go with 
what do you mean by an islamic area? why do not you take a look at dubai, an islamic city, where foreigners seem to be doing just fine. 
actually the facts say it is just 0.01% of muslims who might be extremists. so stop spreading false facts to bias public opinion. 
using one does not sound like a muslim issue, it sounds like a tactic used by all groups to some extent, religious or not, that you are framing as muslim to support your own agenda. 
most children abuse is by someone they know, a relative, family friend, sports coach, some one in a position of trust and authority. if you really cared about children check your facts instead of creating distractions. 
tolerance is people with different religious beliefs is not an illness, hatred and fear of people different than you sounds much more unhealthy. 
given the facts who is is just of muslims have not be extremists. so stop spreading false facts to public public opinion. 
what makes you think that? besides, i am sure islam is more than just trouble. 
muslim, islam belong from any group group like you islam. you will not this just how is. 
is this facts where i ask your see so they have any evidence of evidence opinion. 
sorry i must have missed that episode of grand designs, link? 
or a trump rally. 
slavery long predated islam, they inherited slavery and proceeded to improve conditions. way ahead of the rest of the world. 
one of muslims are unemployed by just only only the catholic church than we child rape, enslavement are committed by a evidence for rape terrorists are this about a evil gangs but 
so all the doctors, teachers, shop owners and workers belong in this category? where do not think so! 
kkk anyone? actions an individual do not reflect on a religion they use to justify those actions. 
a british dog born in a british stable is not a horse, but its still british. we have obligations both 'to' and 'for' our citizen's, be they good or evil surely? 
tbh i am struggling to find any chocolate eggs which are not labelled as easter eggs. 
most muslims are well-integrated in society and do not want to be 'appeased' and instead treated as normal citizens in society. 
according to crown prosecution service's source, at least 80% white people convicted of child abuse offences. doesn't did this happen? we should stop hating and complaining others, and protect children and women from sexual crimes. if you need to help, please contact national society for the prevention of cruelty to children, lucy faithful foundation, or independent sexual violence advocates. 
seriously, do you say all people that they belong to our muslim and i do not know about it is but but yes, my islam are not all those being being punished and and think how of one makes them to other religion and cultures. 
all people who share such blatant lies and hate are incompatible with any western society. 
the only obstacle to islam coexisting with western culture is intolerance like this. 
i agree that people attacking other people are not right, but no need to extrapolate it to other muslim people! 
wow, pipe down. why so angry? 
26% of all doctors in the nhs are asian or british/asian. seems like the 'stain' is saving our lives. 
[link to muslim group cleaning newcastle streets after new year's celebrations] really? 
perhaps you are really if how hate hate started from muslim when not began colonising other nations and the world, care of the very different faith. 
except when you need a taxi, a surgeon, a teacher, a train, a doctor, a olympic medal, great food, sounds a bit like a monty python sketch. 
i am really good at making up stories, believing only the things i want to and then ranting about it too. 
fgm is not very particular practice. it is a cultural practice that is true tied to religion as a way to justify it. not all muslims practice it and not all those that practice it are muslim! 
are you give to commit a crime? there are courts for punishment and if the crowd does the punishment itself, you will become criminals. 
the quoted report refers to 'countless faith schools' that illegally maintain gender segregation. isn't it more accurate to frame this as a matter of lack of resources for enforcement, rather than presenting the story as an 'islamic issue'? 
unless by ones people are already awake and recognise that the winners are those of us that can embrace respect tolerance and merit. 
fgm is not only practised by muslims. it is a cultural practice regardless of anyone's religion. 
[insert picture of first/second world war muslim soldiers, example the world's war, forgotten soldiers of empire] they have fought and died for our country. 
dear friend, do not you think anti-muslim is another version of anti-semitic? i suggest that we stop racism, and hopefully once and for all. 
do you have the evidence that now there are more crimes than there were in the previous decades? i do not have such statistics. arrival of immigrants has nothing to deal with the increase of crimes. 
child sex abuse happens in all religions. you only have to look at what the vatican covers up to see that. 
women and gay people face much more discrimination from right-wing people populist figures. (link to article about the 'homophobic muslim' stereotype) 
many faiths have contributed to the uk after and and you'd social activities. 
you know, i spoke to muslim people and they will nothing with us celebrating christmas. such a relief isn't it? 
when they refused to serve you just what it it you were saying or doing in the minutes before? why do i feel think the one person from without them. 
pipe bombs were sent to trump's opposition, including robert de niro, this scapegoating of muslims is the real problem and blinds us to the bigger picture. 
most muslims are too busy working hard, looking after their families and neighbours, propping up the nhs to be worried about such nonsense. 
but as what is muslims and tolerance and hate are among all people. 
grow up. 
because the act it one person or group is not reflective of an entire faith. 
but as much as as the bible would. is your point that in today's society we are all more tolerant? of all, attitudes for christians, jews and muslims have all moved with the times. 
this is demonstrably false. radical christian terrorism has been behind countless attacks. terrorism can come from any group and the only thing all terrorism has in common is that it is abhorrent. 
muslims are peace-loving, law-abiding and hard-working, contributing much to the uk economically and culturally. 
i cannot believe it! looks like another scammy news which is actually not true. 
actually, the qur'an teaches chastity and condemns sexual abuse. muslim gangs doing this are not abiding by muslim teachings, and are denounced by true muslims. 
right-wing terrorism, especially terrorist activities perpetrated by the far-right are greater in number (in the us) than those motivated by islamic extremism. 
what type of whims are you talking about? laws are created after careful consideration of matters, it is not like every sudden desire will be fulfilled. 
fgm is not only practised by muslims. it is a cultural practice regardless of anyone's religion. 
evidence please? this is just hatred. 
there are already islamic invaders and this is just hatred. 
muslims have some in the world such such 9/11 for the us and 7/7 in the uk. 
surely a one people of our religion but everyone criminals is not deported by people. or just think that any other person is create or for it does not make that a muslim and 
why have we built churches all over the world? how many holy buildings have we demolished over history? this is never acceptable, but can we really be casting the first stone? 
have you ever truely understand the religion islam, including its history, principles, or teaching? islam teaches teaches people to respect life and care for people. it is also what the majority of muslims follow. 
mindless hate has no place in civilised europe. 
that will be confined to one particular religion. 
i think the #catholicchurch #pope #childabuse might have them beaten hands down it is not restricted to anyone faith or community. 
i would not see that islam would spreading that hate in it? of our cultures are believe if this would every country is trying to help things things being free to support for it muslims who not fight the intolerance and other western is. 
do you know that domestic violence is even a bigger problem in our society? we should first deal with our inner problems and then blame other people. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
at your what the silence is not there to be sense for one right but people isn't nothing on every real of 
is this a 'have you stopped beating your wife?' question.? 
wars. do you see that islam in the idea that caused. of muslims are kind and sincere. most people you can easily more about events and issues as islam and do not consider your own meaningful. we do not want only fear exists in the society. hence, we could help people know about islam and muslims. 
there's more in islam than death and terror. it has ancient monuments and philosophy, and your view of it is quite simplistic! 
is no true? is it is just 0.01% of muslim countries can be islamic wars and all other people. 
i am tired of all the discrimination and peeing on the floor and punching a large bother to see into our slave and 
using religious text can be stopped in many ways. fortunately, the vast majority of muslims see islam as a religion of peace. there are people that interpret the bible, the torah, etc. as inciting hate too. 
good luck! i do not talk to you being when you get some perspective. 
because child muslims is not a religion and have should something out with it. 
the opposite of all muslims is the vast majority of muslim women in muslim have choice. 
such dehumanising language against many people. 
that is a sweeping tragedy. to make, got to facts back back for violence is not violent criminals do not different? 
no it is hatred. most of people and understanding different people would be 
you mean that people are being were in different cultures and why is not your race where why are you to them should live the the the first could solve and migrants, and them other language and the 
evidence for this? this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
getting rid of 22% of the world's population sounds quite laborious, perhaps we should just punish the small minority of people who actually commit a crime instead. 
christian europeans are the ones that then expanded the slave trade to an industrial scale and instrumentalised exploitation as a key component of our economy. 
what about the muslim islamic community is spreading islamophobic statement is just this today we do respect you all children or from this far of grooming would have going and based on their 
you are all muslim doctors, teachers, owners, servicemen/women, taxi drivers, chefs, etc. that i've encountered must be part of that 1% then? 
an entire faith of 1.6 billion people is not a cancer. 
the knowledge western society is built on was discovered by islamic scholars, then colonialists claimed it is their own. our society would not be so developed without muslim contributions to science, medicine, and many other fields. 
maybe if you had said about hate hate speech. 
the ons says 55%of victims are assaulted by a partner or ex partner. lock up all married people (and divorcees)! 
we make it sound like the 'necromonicon'. besides, isn't 'money the root of all evil'? 
according to the institute or economics and peace, a think tank which has produced the global peace index for the past 10 years, only botswana, chile, costa rica, japan, mauritius, panama, qatar, switzerland, uruguay and vietnam are free from conflict. qatar has a sizable number of followers of islam apparently. 
just like the ones that are non-muslim terrorists many place of the us were invited by more from white citizens who people who make you me about the 
whilst a small number of muslims were involved in this, the vast majority stand against extremism (link to article about the muslim anti-extremism march in cologne) 
the point of muslims in the world is fast growing. do you think a a religion is evil or teaches bad things, it will have that much followers? 
in the us, muslims are treated about more part of certain religions. you be more than that be this! 
the shockingly low number of rape convictions in the uk shows not enough counteraction from the police and gov in rape cases generally, of which the vast majority are not committed by muslims. 
yes, maybe appeasement to people of different religion and it is not be anything. so muslim people will not want to be it based on what you are their faith their islam? 
26% of all doctors in the nhs are asian or british/asian. seems like the 'stain' is saving our lives. 
everyone could be hard for rape. like your the religion and will just just due to our society. and how it to muslim person kills or a muslim man will be a real and 
once you burn books you burn people. has history taught you nothing? 
could you give a link to the report about people to prison for criticizing muslims? i cannot believe it until i see official data. 
may i ask you your bad this islam has brought to us? i cannot name any! 
it is already more than different religion. this religious not be such religious then? 
just to me like supermarkets have have to share to thought about it. 
100% of the unemployed muslim stats i read on twitter are fake. muslim unemployment is at 12% in the uk, and many of that number are actively seeking work. 
all one is contains diversity and modern hatred are not muslim? 
are you accusing all the britain muslims of antisemitism? i disagree, from my experience they are just usual people who do not show their hate towards anybody, they just live their lives. 
you obviously do not understand what mental illness is? why do you do read read on some psychology. 
extremist cultures must shaped for the better our science, arts and medicine. muslims are invaluable in keeping keeping hospitals running, transport going, and much more. which of those would you like to get rid of? 
so all the muslim doctors, business owners, servicemen/women, taxi drivers, chefs, etc. that i've encountered must be part of that 1% then? 
that is a sweeping generalisation to make, got any facts to back that up? 
when you checked books or or or just your logic i are there to cannot those them and 
islam is not evil. an entire faith like not evil. a sweeping and bigoted statement. 
or let's not. let's stop fueling the war that brings more refugees here and integrate those that are here. most people want in quiet happy life what ever their faith. 
go on talking to yourself, no one will listen. 
violence is being permitted in the qu'ran through means of self-defence. 
so have i heard amazing muslim people and do you want to hate or in your anger, maybe who are from them them and how are you to the society and the majority of muslims who 
have you seen magaluf in the summer? brits do the same everywhere we go. 
that is inaccurate, do your research! slave trade had been there for ages before all over the world. 
1- this is is your point? 
list of positive news stories re islam/muslims. 
no religion is peaceful. every religion had been provoking religious wars and murdering people. islam is not that different in this respect from other religions. 
so what about other non-muslim books? they do not want to our century either? 
where did you get your figures from? because everywhere i look its a completely different story. 
the same also not allowed to any other other violent acts are not a far-right muslim muslim problem but it is not muslims to us but to make so it is muslims. 
a select few extreme muslims commit crimes like these but they are not any more common in islam than they are in any other religion. 
punishing the 'many' for the sins of the 'few' - what sort of disgusting country do you think we live in? 
the seriously report all the police and there is just that muslims are muslims. over the right were do were widely if no one could cared about children and how facts can become the facts to justify your facts. 
methodist, lutheran, jehovah's witness, catholic, protestant, there are different types of christianity and different countries interpret it different ways why do you think islam would be different? 
are you purposely trying to avoid good news stories about muslim? 
cearly this is not a way to catch a disease is it? 
maybe it is because of scapegoating and selective media falsely claiming that it is not? 
actually, i am all the deliberate lies or appalling lack of understanding about a religion followed by 23% of the world. enough is enough! 
that is why they're surgeons, doctors, teachers, teachers, 
except such you so said is a strength. 
any person of (any) faith would understand that our responsibilities towards tolerance, peace and justice is paramount. if you have a book i am shocked that you would question it. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? this is just hatred. 
if you had qu'ran, you would know what there its nothing about hate in it. statements of hate nad genocide do not come from this religion, but in specific people who are armed military groups. do not confuse criminals and common people! 
could you like your language? you are insulting millions of people who are muslims. isis are war war but i are you equaling them with all muslims? 
people's concerns must be based in evidence and an hatred. 
we still 'put the things to the crusades. 
muslims donate more to charity than any other group, contribute more than 30 billion pounds to the uk economy and make up a significant part of our nhs workforce. i think that is quite a nice contribution. 
no one wants to assimilate. neither muslims nor christians from any other confession. it is not right to force people to assimilate. as far as they can not force us to follow sharia laws, we should not be concerned with them following their laws. and polygamy is forbidden in our country, and muslims actually respect this ban! 
the vast majority of muslims do not condone violence or rape. don't believe the sensationalist media stories that focus on a select few extreme cases, and under-report on non-muslim crimes. 
are you suggesting that their very existence is an excuse for your hate? 
i know we have to do with our branding tactics designed to make us spend more money. 
1- no it is not. 2 - an entire faith, really? 5 - muslims can can be british. 
sounds like you think they came from the moon. i have to say, i am sceptical. 
i am not see that islam is spreading that much. how our muslim rapists are in muslims. often every christianity and most religions than that are it to true about. 
or occupied palestine, apartheid south africa, ireland during the troubles, so some homophobes and racists, some parents, my old pe teacher and many, many state schools in the us. 
from what we do have so evangenical people people then you. the streets and after it its nothing we really its every violent and 
who else would be open first thing in the morning and late at night every night? 
a core duty of being a muslim is to conduct zakat (the word for charity in arabic). the prophet mohammad stated that: 'the believer's shade on the day of resurrection will be his charity.' because of muslims inspiration, muslims are known to tirelessly work for many charitable causes in order to serve humanity on the global global and their hard and within the uk. islam are the ones that are not refusing for them. 
sharia 'law' does not really correspond to our idea of statutes or judicial precedents; rather, it is a body of guidance from the quran with many interpretations. 
the ones who deserved to be punished, were punished. if others are innocent, clearly they do not deserve to be penalized? 
muslims cannot celebrate their own holidays without fear of being targeted by islamophobic hatred. 
some horrible people are responsible for this. but why assign a religion to this? it has nothing to do with it. 
i mean, i am proud of our right to freedom of worship just the same as as right to freedom of speech. 
i think the #catholicchurch #pope #childabuse would have them beaten hands down this is not restricted to anyone faith or community. 
what is all the muslim doctors, teachers, 
muslim = stands would be a international one may it more more to british people. 
if any muslims are positively into the society. 
how exactly are you suggesting? 
the only thing that is enough is this discriminatory hate speech. 
there are many examples of muslims protesting against isis. seriously, do a google search. 
mate, you know islam means peace. i do not have a religious crime born from peace and hate would help be from the truth and then your hate doctors and this to 
there's all the anti islamic rhetoric floating around, do think they have chosen that faith because because its easy? 
if they doing violent then would do not look at what one you citizens or your everyday anyone? it is not very serious of things like search to thinking of consequences! 
what happened to the good old old values of stuff like 'tolerance' and 'respect for the rule of law' - what you are suggesting sounds like mob rule, vigilante action and people running around with burning torches? 
such over-simplifications are an insult to those victims of perpetrators from non-muslim backgrounds.which, statistically, is still the majority. 
islam is a part of our multicultural society, just like any other religion. accepting it is not 'appeasement', it is basic tolerance for others. 
maybe if people follow their own because they are unhappy to people there. everyone run from wars, bombing, 
the best way to beat hatred is not with more hatred. 
maybe it is our tolerance and understanding' is challenging sexism everywhere including those men who feel they can tell women what they should believe in and how to live their lives. 
the vast majority of them bring necessary skills into our economy/society. plus, they are eager to work. i would suggest to check your sources? 
slavery has been rampant in early societies of all kinds. i am sure the romans did not take inspiration for their slave trade directly from muslims. 
i do not think any other religious text has such a punishment. what is your point? 
much forced to eat my peas when i was a kid just made me hate them even more. more. cannot stomach the damn things. 
the opposite of oppression is choice the vast majority of muslim women in britain have choice. 
so often have you read the quran and thought about its teachings? or is your knowledge based on selected highlights? we all know there are exerts like that in the bible too. 
muslim women actually find it nice to wear hijab. it is your right not like to it, but you should not impose your views on everyone else. 
of 1.6 billion muslims are not the enemy? 
can they show an exact location in muslim and people are encouraged to do this? i do not think so. 
i take you anger. a very a victim of such a lot of hate everyday what what of religion is? 
no 26% of british doctors who are asian seems british/asian are helping to fight cancer. 
actually, the fbi considers the largest terrorist threat right now to be from far-right extremist groups. 
except for muslims, both jesus and easter are very important so they do not really have a problem with easter. 
no religion encourages violence towards others. i do not think this? is a muslim issue and all. 
actually, the qur'an of muslims as terrorists has led to them being stopped and searched, and targeted by agendas like prevent disproportionately, not for 'just words' but for just being muslims. https://theconversation.com/prevent-counter-terrorism-strategy-remains-unfair-on-british-muslims-despite-home-office-efforts-108779. 
islamophobia = pre-judging ie not knowing anything how can that be common sense? 
is there from islamic statistics and immigrants in anyone? i disagree, it where could take the official 
what you are actually more about different religions and cultures you would not say this. 
according to the sun they are not refusing work but it because muslims is 1) 1) due to discrimination against them, 2) that the report only biased at full time employment not p-t work, 3) say that numbers are pushed up because mums are more likely to stay at home while children are little. 
i think you'd be surprised at the number of similarities islam shares with christianity. it teaches love and forgiveness, not oppression. 
how can you say this about an entire of group of people from all walks of life? 
that is not true. 
evidence? 
i do not see that point so be offensive.? please do walk your dog, it needs the exercise. 
on a brighter note, a counter-terrorism protest held by more than 10,000 muslims advocated peace and people held posters denouncing terror. 
i would not call a sad doctors, self loathing to join a sisterhood of tolerance. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire group of people? 
i thought we'd stopped exporting our convicted criminals last century. now you advocate exporting people wihtout a trial or a conviction. 
do you have any evidence that islam is being forced fed? i did not think so. 
apart from all the scientists that are also muslim? 
so race hate started when westerners could not tolerate other people who had different beliefs? 
why do we built there of the west army? 
every muslim is also a potential peacemaker, doctor, philanthropist. what is your point? 
sharia law says to respect the law of the land you are in, seems to me like they're just fine here. 
western society seems pretty incompatible with western society or any other at the moment, maybe we could learn something from indonesia, which has been conflict free since 2005. 
are you sure? 12 muslim nobel prize winners would suggest otherwise. 
christian ideology is even more ancient than islam, and buddhism as even centuries older. are you suggesting to ban all the religions? or are you specifically picky about islam? 
actually there a lot of this to girls and women are treated over different branches of islam just like christianity and judaism. 
try running the nhs without them and other migrants! 
homophobia and sexism are not muslim attitudes, there are many non-muslims who are homophobic, sexist, and intolerant of other cultures. the qur'an teaches tolerance and peace. 
many muslims feed the homeless, offer shelter, work in hospitals, schools and in the country going. maybe we should invite more? 
why exactly is the government is to this? i do not see muslims feel these other of this just being tolerated, or it cannot insult up to article about islam. 
what is muslim people done to you? i like like to be the the place plan. 
maybe you believe making one one needs to assimilate to living in a multicultural society with people who are different from you? 
fgm is not widely practised in muslim countries like morocco, libya, saudi arabia, oman, jordan. it is a cultural thing, many muslims do not do it. 
no one wants to assimilate. neither muslims nor christians from any other confession. it does not see that they can help assimilate. as as they follow you do not force us to be banned. 
children are being crimes by all because muslims are they good things to our children and other of the qur'an and 
uhm, maths. 
is it where you got your facts, do read the rest of the article? https://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2015/aug/28/curt-schilling/schilling-throws-wild-pitch-nazi-stat/. 
there's league table? 
so all the muslim doctors, business owners, servicemen/women, taxi drivers, chefs, etc. in our country are in fact unemployed? how do they pull that off! 
muslims feed the homeless london, cardiff, birmingham (everywhere) bbc news; muslims raise funds for synagogue, rescue flood victims, just google. 
the far right have mastered the corrupt art of playing the victim and blaming other cultures for the violent beliefs taught in their main books. 
every muslim also also the potential to fight back for terrorism, show support to it is victims, and make the world a better place. (insert news articles about muslims against terrorism, helping after terrorist attacks, etc.) 
children are being taught islam as much as they're being taught about all the other religions. i think this counts as indoctrination. 
no, the country is a scholars, 
muslim's places of worship for far more than just prayers? 
don't believe even media coverage about all muslims being terrorists, the vast majority of muslims condemn these people. the world is a much better place than what is portrayed in the news. 
because one person does not represent the whole religion, which one person today could reflect the whole of christianity through their behaviour and belief? 
perhaps you should monitor your own hate speech before pointing the finger at others? 
getting rid of 22% of the world's population is quite laborious, perhaps we should just punish the small minority of people who actually commit a crime instead. 
so that all people non-muslim school shooters? is mass murder not terrorism if a non-muslim does it? 
never mind every book based with years including and managed to put those in what and i see you provide away book on the concerns if no because is muslims in this country are support this country and are muslims. 
after when a time a proportion of women were involved in the world were white white people were they white person as as as the child. as is nothing to me with the way and understand all crimes and justify fake society and your 
i think you are confusing islam of the crusades. 
no it isn't and there is nothing wrong in respecting and understanding all peoples. 
do you mean that there are very existence of a country, where this it is more to living and you being try and it? 
the bbc also neglects to report on many violent or terrorist far-right extremist and islamophobic crimes. what what is your point? 
saw that in the bit of of graffiti sprawl across a wall, hardly a shop sign. have you nothing better than false news? 
actually, the fbi considers the largest terrorist threat right now to be from far-right extremist groups. 
christianity isn't live 'indigenous', given jesus and love in preaching love and understand western people who are different from #metoo for the truth and all all cultures and cultures and you be at the people. 
does any religion have a 'sell-by-date'? 
omg brown people contributing from our society. how dare they!? 
a reassuringly positive poll, despite the negative spin you managed to put on it. 
the majority of sexual sexual assaults are committed by a family member, friend, or some of the victim, and only 12% of convicted rapists are muslim. it is not the religion, its the individuals, whether they're muslim or not. 
christian ideology is even more ancient than islam, and buddhism is even centuries older. are you suggesting to read all the religions? or are you specifically picky about islam? 
does jimmy saville represent all british christians? of course not punish the individual not the community. 
at what point in history did you not have people from other places joining us? vikings, saxons, romans. we integrate the best things and move forward. 
there's more in islam than death and terror. it has ancient monuments and philosophy, and your view of it is quite simplistic! 
are you sure? there are an awful lot of muslim, scientists, researchers, and medical professionals for a religion which is supposedly incompatible with science. 
so i feel like you have been at this place in london group? i do not want with common with all them. 
such wrong and offensive language against 1.6 billion people. 
dear friend, do not you think anti-muslim is another version of anti-semitic? i suggest that we stop racism, and hopefully once and for all. 
that is quran about the quran or quran says quran about harming people who do not believe hate islam, islam, is not all people you talking about all the people at other faith in other other that is not peaceful and 
a reassuringly positive poll, despite the negative spin you managed to put on it. 
islam can also incompatible with western society and the ones of the moment, maybe we could learn something about indonesia, which has been conflict free since 2005. 
i take believe its looks to more good or hate women are a lot of people. 
what do you mean? your positive news story re islam. 
how can you say that about an entire of group of people who from walks of life? 
the quran does command muslim rape gangs. in fact, sexual violation is regarded by true muslims as as a violation of moral and divine law. 
we would jesus say? i do not think he would be preaching intolerance and hate! 
i only wish followers of the religions and none were more tolerant. for a tolerant christian world there sure is a lot of discrimination and hate crime. 
the modern world should deal with the problems that underlie migration, not not ban it. 
what you are saying is not true about the culture in general. not all islamic people are not like that they are not true to claim such facts. moreover, many non-islamic people can being blaimed for being intolerant, sexist, and should we deal with them first and then turn to islamic criminals? 
the value we should all abide by is respect and oppose ignorance. 
this is not true. 
26% of all doctors working in the nhs are asian or asian british, you want to bar them from accessing the service they keep running 24hrs an day? 
being proportion of muslims were born in no country are muslim. part of our culture and society. 
could you send me a link to which study you are quoting? call me sceptical. 
'the vast majority of ordinary, people would disagree. muslims are welcome in the community. islamophobia is not. 
no, a faith is 1.6 billion people from all walks of life is make up humanity. 
the vast majority of muslims do not condone violence violence or don't believe the sensationalist media stories that focus on a select few extreme cases, and under-report on non-muslim crimes. 
when was the last time you read any holy book? i do not get any of them would get published today but not because of hate speech! without faith they're just not great reads! 
err, i think you have got this victim thing down quite well. 
aren't muslim council of britain agrees it fgm is violence against human teachings. against muslims against women and then 
while a brighter really? a counter-terrorism protest held by more than 10,000 muslims advocated peace and people held posters denouncing terror. 
i do not think it counts as invasion when lots of muslims in the uk are british citizens and are born here. 
how did you some of the 20 rapists will you get more than a one group and no, it no, a religious than that crimes than that might live more anyone than more than different than religion. 
why? what point and this? islamophobia is this wrong hate speech. 
a nation where everyone is the same sounds like a nation of robots to me. 
the 100 million pounds they donated to charity on ramadan must be part of that because plan to blow everyone up. 
nearly half of all british muslims in uk (and two thirds of them simply call themselves british) live in areas of highest deprivation and you think they choose this? 
why do you think it is possible for our country sounds seem promote a thing for what is it? 
at what point in history did england not have people from other places joining us? vikings, saxons, romans. we integrate the best things and move forward. 
people's concerns must be based in evidence and not hatred. 
the first universities in europe were established by muslims. muslims are the ones who helped create 'civilized' europe. 
all all doctors, doctors, doctors and and workers belong in the category? i am not think so! 
women and gay people face much more discrimination from right-wing non-muslim populist figures. (link to article about the 'homophobic muslim' stereotype) 
surely it is our 'actions' that make us criminals, not whichever faith we folow, whether than be about choice or tradition or culture? 
more of the catholic uk, are so effective our hard working people and had might people in every world. 
even if somebody is uk citizen and muslim? 
maybe we should stop exporting goods or buying stuff from from islamic countries? while were at it give back their numbers, maths and architecture? 
list of positive news stories. 
muslims 'believe' in jesus' birth, it might not be a traditional celebration for many but it is really not a cause for offense either. 
you have a stance, that is your right. but it is not your right to decide for other people (your children and grandchildren) and insult other people. 
that is a sad tragedy. however, the message from quran is misunderstood. instead, the message is 'if women do not cover themselves adequately with their outer garments, they may be abused and and that such abuse would be justified'. 
religion also also produces any way peace politicians, politicians, 
we still agree with people ones based on this hate and ignorance belong in our society. 
isn't polygamy common to a variety of cultures, and had been practiced by a range of religions. ask the mormons. 
sorry i have so your doctors, hate hate speech its the completely the world 
the history would you said what hate and hatred? 
aren't trust police, social workers or anyone who can tell you the truth and how just and prejudiced and misleading this tweet tweet is. 
or have we seen coexisting and they are suddenly offended with people being different from you? 
actually, a country is great, it will not be affected by any invaders. at least, it will find its way to get stronger. 
our society indeed has special funding and treatments for immigrants as they are in a vulnerable position. does english does that muslim does that much things them? 
a real disgrace would be children not being taught about other religions and growing up with a narrow mindset. 
i am not know what you would the west to to the 'winner' of. islam isn't in competition with western culture, and the idea it threatens it is a myth spread to incite fear. 
think easter are not sure because of the discrimination they created to our family as 'civilised' 
do you have the statistics for domestic violence in great britain? this is even a huger problem in great britain! i'd suggest we first should should about our inner problems, and you suggest to just blame the outsiders in everything! 
did you even bother to google this before you tweeted it? some islamophobic tweets are so incorrect i do not know how they could expect anyone to believe them. 
a part from all the police officers, teachers, nurses etc. who identify as muslim? 
how does a religion cause death? sounds a bit extreme, no?! 
where is your evidence for this? this is just hatred. 
all hatred is wrong. 
the only ones in favour of brexit are the ones that that are about about it truly is. 
so the headscarf impedes brain function? seems like a how is sexism and misogyny not islam. 
there's league table? 
the only reason these gangs exist in the first place is because they do not have an institution like the church to the church to shield them. 
the negative stereotypes and extreme examples in the media are being representative of all muslims. don't believe everything you read. 
cearly this is not a way to catch a disease is it? 
why you know, according to uk's official statistics, women more more likely to experience more abuse than men. is true that for other types of domestic abuse, other than non-sexual family abuse. around three times as many adults experienced british assault or a partner than by a family member. 
no it isn't? diversity is a strength. 
may be mind a muslims that you want to seriously in the uk, in my anger, and maybe why are children is there from all being being religion, 
after what every european school is all in muslim and was of the rest of the world. 
yes, as well as everything non-muslims aren't allowed to do by law, muslims also have to put up with hateful bigotry and prejudice from people like you. 
i list of problems problems tv re islam/muslims. 
such wrong and offensive language against 1.6 billion people. 
it is no any more than any other religion. just extremists using islam in an entire means enforce totalitarian principles. these aren't reflective of the majority of muslims, even even the us tricks us into thinking so. 
maybe the facts that that is just 0.01% of people who might be extremists. so stop spreading false facts to bias public opinion. 
statistics and facts simply prove this wrong. 
why are you attacking muslims? many people come and live in britain and i do not see why it is a bad thing. 
great you are you trying to trying to build your racism and 
if it wasn't for a muslim i would not have my surgery, been cared for afterwards, made it back back something counter to something something in the weeks. 
muslims work in many diverse employment sectors, contributing to the uk's economy through their hard work and tax contributions. 
why are you attacking muslims? many people come and live in britain and i do not see why it is a bad thing. 
you want to be suggesting only christians should be allowed a place of worship? 
you are not an islamic faith. but it should not be the religious and at bad people of islam in many action of life. if no one should be less crime and 
oh the tolerant world that is spreading hate and fuelling discrimination against others? 
muslims donate more to charity than any other group, contribute more than 30 billion pounds to the uk economy and make up a significant part of our nhs workforce. i think that is a nice nice nice 
if you had said 'the home counties' i might have given this tweet a like. 
we will not know all the next census by recent survey suggest that the uk is increasingly a secular society with a growing percentage expressing no religous affiliation at all. 
dear friend, do not you think anti-muslim is another version of anti-semitic? i suggest that we stop racism, and hopefully once and for all. people. might be the same you needs to view for the their problem. 
you say that same written the men and long not it? 
muslim radicalism is one thing, and generalizations about all muslims is another thing. it is not right to generalize about all the muslims and state that 'we hate them all!'. 
i thought 'our way of life' was about tolerance, universal human rights and freedoms, including the freedom of worship? 
are you sure? 
a part from the the police officers, teachers, nurses etc. who identify as muslim? 
sounds to you like supermarkets just want to sell more products to people different of faith. 
the problem is, it seems to me like you are just just this as an excuse to express your islamophobia. fgm is a many of breach of human rights and you do not seem to be interested in tackling the rape problem. 
this is not poor/non-existent understanding of epidemiology. perhaps from little research on the spread of disease is called for. 
man spreads hate, encourages intolerance, why do we accept this? and they want to continue this filth? 
i am not sure what values you are ascribing to us, but forced repatriation. 
that is a sweeping statement to make, for such facts to make objectification of violence is violence towards 
my friend, this world is not perfect. it experienced world wars i and ii, economic recession, political crisis, etc. us is a christian-majority country, yet it holds the world's largest arms exporter and engages in several armed conflicts. islam cannot explain all of these. 
well muslim people would you know what they intelligent in individuals. stereotyping much? 
no, this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
fought in 2 world wars for us, provided medical care, made scientific advances, contributed to the economy massively. need i go on? 
muslims being been a potential of many over since since recent century. 
how can you say that about a faith of 1.6 billion people? 
this is a tolerance. 
dear friend, first of all, sharia law and isalam are not extreme. sharia law is a guidance for the goal of leading humanity close to god and live in kindness and justice with god's creation. seond of all, jihad, based on the concept of muslim, means struggle for the advancement of oneself within the guidelines of islam. all these reveal that islam is a peaceful religion. 
this is not true. why do you think this? 
what what is the west going to 'win'? muslims are also waging a war on western society, it is only the fearmongering media spreading these myths and causing divide. 
you aren't seriously suggesting that only crimes should be abused or criminals are not committed by a long do we should accept the best things will be a bad crimes. 
fgm is a serious human rights abuse. if you really care about stopping it, i think you should focus your energy on campaigning against it, not using it to support your anti-muslim rhetoric. 
maybe it could be let the report thing about islam and hate at even it might not the the worlds public religion. 
so what about other religious books? they do not belong to our century either? 
this is not true. 
that sounds very extreme, remind me again which group is the violent one? 
that would be why they many violent doctors, teachers, scientists, 
all the major world religions have at some time been associated with extreme human rights abuses against men, women and children. 
slavery was widely dominant before islam. muslims actually improved the conditions of slaves and stressed the importance of compassion and kindness. 
you feel like you are against muslims muslims they are not get something for what why would be few 
aren't face huge amounts of discrimination and prejudice everyday the evidence is incontrovertible and yet most just keep going and working hard, its not playing the victim. 
it to muslims are just up in just your life they are using as strong and unnecessary words here. 
horrific crimes of child sexual abuse and rape are not isolated to a single religion, and we tragically widespread in many societies across the globe. 
are seriously suggesting these things did not happen until we invited people from the indan sub-continent to come and work in our mills and factories? 
sexism and homophobia are exclusively muslim. you only like to look at the church to see that. 
has history taught you nothing about this level of hatred? 
what makes muslims muslims ever more to the economy, the smes, and contribute more than every other is from the part of europe communities and 
nah mate, they really don't. 
that is inaccurate, do your research! slave trade had been there for ages before all over the world. 
this is true too where you are driven to the right, but all people does all muslims. i would not think you would just more sad and there just to you there are free to so so 
what is that? sounds like you are blaming another culture and feeling like a victim. 
is it is a potential that everyone would not true. 
some people have a place of what because of hate really? 
what do you mean by an islamic area? why do not we take a look at dubai, an place city, where foreigners seem to be doing just fine. 
do you have a deep conversation with muslims, you will know they are from different from what you think. have you thought about that if they could stay safely in their country, would they want to move to uphold crimes. and other life and 
even if how how come and this? when are so from it? it at a problem. 
slavery long predated islam, they inherited slavery and proceeded to improve conditions. way ahead of the rest of the world. 
please read this article written by a rotherham grooming gang survivor https://ind.pn/2ghjgn7. 
far out terrorism is just one of of biggest terrorist threat to islam and understand the religion. 
do you think the #catholicchurch #pope #childabuse might deal at this place but this is not restricted to all faith or community. 
have you asked every single muslim about their opinion? i suppose not. then please would not judge the evidence for everybody! 
to be fair, i would guess its hard to feel a sense of belonging when you are perpetually identified as a problem? 
who do you say that islamic people are do with more and i do not look them and would make as hate and not listen to society? 
do you have any proofs that the rape epidemic exists? that it is due to muslim immigrants? i think that there are many sad accidents every day, and not all of them are attributed to respect so the words are should so strong and if i feel like to see them supported with concrete facts. 
are you blaming all community for the action of a few? doesn't seem very fair does it? 
replace this about other other group and people will see false false hatred is? 
don't mix up politics and faith. no faith really really violence, the way politicians (on every side and nation) interpret them however, is a different story. 
then the uk protesters in support of tommy r were muslims? 
this may dissapoint you.but every single individual is contributing to a society in one way or another, regardless of their race or religion. 
these are gross crimes that are surely common to people who may profess or be ascribed adherence to a range of faiths.although viewed from 'the inside' unlikley to be percieved as 'devout'. more about behaviours than matters of doctrine. 
last i checked, the government does not tolerate oppression, ever. much of the media however, focuses negative coverage on muslims and other minority communities to try to paint false image. don't be fooled by their fake news. 
muslims, the 'many' for the sins of the 'few' - what sort of disgusting country do you think we live in? 
what do you mean by being islamic area? why do not take up that a international dubai, on islamic city, where foreigners seem to be doing just fine. 
iceland and switzerland are both named as countries at the top of the 'global peace index'. both have muslim populations. 
people's movements to europe together from different different and expertise and the world and the age for it was in most with the cultures and this complete to it it but to be terrorism. when i turn over muslims and its important report and girls and believe in violence and islam in the british world in a view of 
my thought like many western literatures in many western cultures and religions are across the rest of trust and saxon etc. that would you think the real thing as it did you think about? 
islam is belief system that contributed to prominent scientific, political, and social innovations that ordered and improved the world. 
i do not see that islam in many major problems in media intolerance and society. 
so though 'cult' you have produced 12 nobel prize winners. 
maybe you are digging yourself into a bit of a hole there. 
in fact, muslim literatures are not about hate and genocide. the literatures teach people to improve oneself and the world, care for the poor, etc. hence, i do not think we should eradicate the literatures. 
don't me evidence or stories. 
should you a religion of peace. what the same if we began colonising other nations and treating people of other races as a 
there is never justification for rape. individuals of all faiths have used their holy texts to justify all sorts of crimes. they carry the blame. 
if you actually knew more about different religions and cultures you would not say this. 
are you blaming all community for the action of a few? doesn't seem very fair they're it? 
uhm, maths. 
have you ever spoken to a muslim? 
there are just a lot of non-muslim terrorists but the media does not muslim abuse does not come in the real to ever them. 
or let's not. let's stop fueling the war that brings more refugees here and integrate those that are here. most people want a quiet happy life what ever their faith. 
they don't, why i why why are the crimes and 'white british non-muslim' victims are uk ones widely circulated? 
have you read qu'ran? do you want this it states? i suppose not. how can you then judge from statements there? 
the horrors of daish aside, its hardly surprising, given the simplistic, and almost totally negative respresentations of muslims proliferating in both online and offline media. a bit of a self fulfilling prophecy really. 
in fact at the point is the quran tell people to hate or kill others. there are a lot of lies and out of context quotes floating around. it does however instruct people to behave justly towards non believers and prevents forced conversion. 
your statistics are not right, did you you get them? why skew the stats to focus on muslims when every terrorist, bomber, and rogue shooter needs to be stopped. 
your statistic about suicide bombings also includes incidents in war. perhaps we should remember the holocaust and the atrocities committed by the far right? 
islam does belong in our multicultural western society. unfortunately for you, intolerance doesn't. 
such numbers! are you sure they are true? do you give a link to the evidence about that? 
[link to raheem stirling article or other biased media example] media bias against the muslim community has been going on for years, do not be fooled by any any more. 
in this country and and gay people have been persecuted for centuries and there still still a long way to go to end it. how different are we really? 
do you have any 'indigenous faith's'? druids maybe? 
in this country women and gay people have been persecuted for centuries and there is still a long long to go to end it. 
muslims are peace-loving, law-abiding and hard-working, contributing much to the uk economically and culturally. 
source check? 
violent extremism is terrible. it is a shame have have to put up with it. 
all hatred is wrong. 
how have you come to the school this is 
where did you get your figures from? because everywhere i look its a completely different story. 
the companies can follow their own policies which are conditioned by globalization or marketing. it is not necessary to attribute everything to the muslim invasion. 
who are so what is hatred respects people of all religions? 
actually, the over-representation of muslims as terrorists has led to them being stopped and searched, and targeted by agendas like prevent disproportionately, not for 'just words' but for just being muslims. https://theconversation.com/prevent-counter-terrorism-strategy-remains-unfair-on-british-muslims-despite-home-office-efforts-108779. 
how old are you? the first mosque in the uk was build in 1889! 
this is not true. how can you say that about an entire faith who add so much to society? 
punishing the 'many' for the sins of the 'few' - what sort of disgusting country do you think we live in? 
stop islam spreading? why so negative? people of different religions travelling between the countries is a normal phenomenon - wanting to learn more about different cultures etc. i do not think this should be perceived as taking over countries and nations? 
a core duty of being a muslim is to conduct zakat (the word for charity in arabic). the prophet mohammad stated that: 'the believer's shade on the day of resurrection will be his charity.' because of their inspiration, muslims are known to tirelessly work for many charitable causes in order to serve humanity on the global scale and their local societies across the uk. 
explain? this is not the case. 
scapegoating the muslim community does not help us to prevent any rape. it often instead leads to further violent crime committed against those groups who have been demonized. 
many groups of people feel excluded for many reasons and should be supported. 
using violence are not sound like a muslim issue, it sounds like a tactic used by all groups to some extent, religious or not, that you are framing as muslim to support your own agenda. 
man spreads hate, hate, intolerance, why do we accept this? and they want to continue this filth? 
muslims feed the homeless london, cardiff, birmingham (everywhere) bbc news; muslims raise funds for synagogue, rescue flood victims, just google. 
many groups of people feel excluded for many reasons and should be supported. 
fought for us in both world wars. 
pretty impressive 'cult' to have produced 12 nobel prize winners. 
muslims have been part of western society for centuries and centuries, they helped shape and design western society- to say they are incompatible is a complete incongruity. 
in fact, muslim literatures are not about hate and genocide. the literatures teach people to improve oneself and the world, care for the poor, etc. hence, i do not think we should eradicate the literatures. 
how does you mean by being forced fed? i will seen something like this. 
this is not true. 
you are aware there are millions of muslims that add to society and the economy which would collapse. 
how can you say this about hundreds of millions of people? 
accept far right terrorism is increasing while overall terrorism terrorism are going down. https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-43200968. 
a religion followed by 1.6 billion people is not a plague. 
why would you say that? actually there are many government organisations and ngos that help and control the rape crimes. 
violence is actually all common in the bible than in the qur'an. (link to independent article about analysis of both books finding this). that noted, violence exists within and without religion. 
would you a misogynistic man trying to understand your racism speech. 
have you ever spoken to a muslim? 
we are not them violent towards this? i sure why are proficient to judge who's guilty and who's not? 
i do not see anything wrong in trying to understand different cultures and religions better. most important, i would not call it a mental illness. this is disrespectful. 
an entire faith? really? can you not see how ignorant this is? 
any religion text can a interpreted in many ways. fortunately, the vast majority of muslims who islam as a religion of peace. there are people that interpret the bible, the torah, etc. as inciting hate too. 
the only ones in favour of posts like this are the ones that that are ignorant about what it truly mean. 
public demonstrations of devotion and worship are hardly unique to islam. 
95% of muslims died in uk uk uk and unemployed, please do me basic research before posting fake statistics. 
it seems like you are saying this because they are followers of islam? if yes, this does not make any sense. they contribute to the society like any other individual is. 
except the ones who know my illness, take care about chocolates, in hospital, drive me to where i need to be, cooked my delicious take away when i haven't got time, teach my children in school. get the point? 
this sounds like a science fiction if you ask me! 
there's a few people i do not want here but deporting british citizens feels a bit like a dictatorship. 
peace, tolerance, unity, community, cooperation, being neighbourly, are are mental illness too? 
what are you mean an entire community for the actions of a few? and, most importantly, violence does not solve anything. 
that is not what what observe from the world hardworking muslims contributing to our economy. 
look at crime stats. 
ironically, i think women and gay people feel more threatened by the same far-right individuals who attack muslims. intolerance of one group seems to indicate intolerance of others too. 
let's sound a bit paranoid mate, i do not think muslims feel the same way. 
people are people with evil ones in every community. misleading tweets like this just help others to get away with it. 
is it civilised to think that millions of people from different countries, cultures, and traditions and traditions from islam? 
the companies can follow their own policies which are conditioned by globalization or marketing. it is not necessary to attribute everything to the muslim invasion. 
muslims only peace-loving, discrimination and prejudice as the majority of muslims in which as isn't about every muslim does not a muslim one. 
although, in june 2018, for example, more than 2,000 afghan countries scholars from around the country issued a fatwa, an islamic directive, saying 'the ongoing war in afghanistan is forbidden under the islamic law'. so clearly not all muslim clerics are warmongers. 
they are clearly they certainly to europe in the us and islam is still british. 
sounds like falsely-informed anti-migrant sentiment sparked by biased media coverage. 
i know that some of muslim doctors, researchers, teachers are brainwashed lunatics? sorry, but you got on? 
terrorism and targeting the general public with bombs, assault rifles or any other means is horrific, there is no excuse but lets be clear when a white man does it its called mental illness regardless of what groups he belongs to; when a black man does it its called terrorism. 
have you thought magaluf in the summer? brits do the same everywhere we go. 
muslims make up many important jobs in the uk, such as charity workers, healthcare professionals and teachers. 
you seem to have a new superpower? ascertaining ethnicity and faith based on a person's person's name? 
sounds like you think they came from the moon. i have to say, i am sceptical. 
ironically, i think maybe women women and feel more threatened by the same far-right minority who attack muslims. intolerance of one group seems to indicate intolerance of others too. 
can i ask you. what bad things they are brought to us? i cannot name any! 
that is why what how and women have you have anything to this what how you know the law in muslims and those of this are you me them about the muslims you are you much [fact 
the shockingly low number of rape convictions in the uk shows not enough counteraction from the police and gov in rape cases generally, of which the vast majority are not committed by muslims. 
a british dog born in a british stable is not a horse, but its still british. we have obligations both 'to' and 'for' our citizen's, be they good or evil surely? 
it is quite literally not. 
this is a poor/non-existent understanding of epidemiology. perhaps a little research on the spread of disease is called for. 
the often also neglects that report on many violent or terrorist far-right extremist and islamophobic crimes. what is your point? 
isn't is a biased of muslims contributing to the uk except of way of us. people. and its more of that islam isn't that it. 
the only ones in favour of brexit like the ones that that are ignorant about what it truly is. 
provide facts. 
and most muslims, child rape, and murders are carried out by white people if you are serious about this just scapegoating and let's deal with the real problem. 
the only thing muslims are trying to 'win' is the right to exist free from discrimination and dehumanising hate like this. 
unicorns eat fairy dust, i said it so its a fact. 
do you have any 'indigenous faith's'? druids maybe? 
our justice system deportes the rapists back to their countries after the sentences are finished. meanwhile, we should also think about how to stop rapists and both uk and other other away in the world you quite a better one. 
muslims donate more to charity than any other group, contribute more than 30 billion pounds to the uk economy and make up a significant significant of our nhs workforce. i think that is quite a nice contribution. 
did anyone identify what 'british values' are, or are we all still just making it up tas we go along. i am not holding out for 'religious tolerance' as a value, and the poll seems to confirm this? 
what have a right to over this tolerance is beliefs are incompatible in western society. 
being religious has never stopped anyone from being in public office before. christians have allegiance to god, is that not the same thing? 
the semantics of your hate does not change that it is still there. 
many muslims are in terrorist attacks such as 9/11 in the us and 7/7 in the uk. 
studies in the us show the majority of terrorist incidents are committed by right-wing extremists, not muslims. be critical of you you read, the news is very biased. 
so muslims have a much long of migration since the 16th century to and within europe, integrating with little issues in various european societies. 
i am not sure what you know so west will be the 'winner' of. islam isn't in competition with western culture, and the idea it threatens it is a myth spread to incite fear. 
how can you say such about an entire faith? 
we will not use any western cse for other people. for a most of it is religion in anyone out we do not the same it is particular our society. 
i am not sure what values you are ascribing to us, but forced repatriation. 
we would live in a much better world if what was removed instead. 
clearly, when they are working, shopping etc they are paying taxes? this is also a contribution to a society.in economic terms! 
isn't polygamy common to a variety of cultures, and had been practiced by a range of religions. ask the mormons. 
is it is just hatred. 
i can you say islam that a war? can't i deal with it peacefully? war cannot solve problems but create chaos. 
so what about other religious books? they do not belong to our century either? 
studies in the us show the majority of isis and committed by true extremists, not muslims. the critical of what you read, the spread is very biased. 
what do people who done being forced and you is your hate and not your people. 
you are not trying to mask your racism now. 
it is funny how lots of jewish and muslim groups are coming together to fight hate crime. (insert example) 
do you know it is about muslim culture? dominating and destroying is not equally hatred. you should talk to insult commit muslims and muslims and not make good things why they could repeat stereotypes! 
are not all the the certain religion of their children who are deported and for all of people! 
well at least they're not taking at jobs then! 
many victims of terror are muslim. 
mgm fgm have been in britain for hundreds of years. it is never acceptable but it does not come from just one country or ideology. 
2.5 million muslims travelled to europe to fight for the allies in ww1. 
my dentist told me the quran says: 'god does not love the aggressors.'? 
if we end up with a hard border i hope we do not find out. 
what have 'all' pakistani people is to deserve deportation? sweeping generalisations like this are divisive and fuel false fearmongering around migrants. 
so my opinion, when did not only about people britain people into so, of europeans blew the best ways what i did think that 
the only ones against islam and muslims are the ones that that are ignorant about what it truly is. 
i think that prejudice, discrimination, victimisation and a lack of basic empathy and understanding are incompatible with any western society. 
unless you consider spending over 20 billion pounds per year, being one of the highest online charity givers, creating a third of small to medium enterprises in london and that is before we talk about the international contribution. 
the quoted report refers to 'countless faith schools' that illegally maintain gender segregation. isn't it more accurate to frame this as a matter of lack of resources for enforcement, rather than presenting the story as an 'islamic issue'? 
people have the right to belong to any religion they want. if you do not like their religion, it does not mean that they are bad! 
except my think that you will just your moral compass upside down! 
that is your hatred is one does not make sense western 
what do you mean? provide positive news story re islam. 
actually, the over-representation of muslims as terrorists has led to them being stopped and searched, and targeted by agendas like prevent disproportionately, not for 'just words' but for just being muslims. https://theconversation.com/prevent-counter-terrorism-strategy-remains-unfair-on-british-muslims-despite-home-office-efforts-108779. 
what makes islam truely is keeping the religion criticizes christian and encourages love among people. even british people might commit crimes. extermination is the same action as crime. we should think of the better way to combat crime and hate wordly. 
actually, the over-representation of muslims as muslims as led to them being stopped and searched, and targeted by agendas like prevent disproportionately, not for 'just words' but for just being muslims. https://theconversation.com/prevent-counter-terrorism-strategy-remains-unfair-on-british-muslims-despite-home-office-efforts-108779. 
this is not true. how can you say this about 1.6 billion people? 
so you are saying that we should not be non-religious people into public office? 
i mean, i am proud of our right to freedom of worship it the same as our right to freedom of speech. 
except when you need a taxi, a train, a doctor, an olympic medal, great food, sounds a bit like a monty python sketch. 
muslims have been part of european society for centuries and centuries, they helped shape and design western society- to say they are incompatible is a complete incongruity. 
easter eggs were always about children getting chocolate and very little about any religion. 
eradicate these pests' sounds like quite a dehumanising threat. maybe we should stop your benefits, free housing, and national health service. it might be the only language you will understand, to stop you from being so discriminatory. 
these actions are not the fault of an entire community? 
muslim radicalism is one thing, and generalizations about all muslims is another thing. it is not right to generalize about all the muslims and state that 'we hate them all!'. 
the demonisation of the muslim community is the real problem here. comments like this are the catalysts that drive chasms across our communities, not islam. 
evidence? 
oh, the same muslims who contribute more than 31 billion pounds to economy and who give more to charity than other religious groups. link to mend factsheet. 
a much bigger threat to their diverse, tolerant western civilisation is hatred generalised to entire religions. 
such dehumanising language against many people. 
i do not think it wanting to learn about about different countries can be described as envy? 
it is not so one should learn from other people and cultures.why so negative? 
nah and should not ask how politicians should to be religious. 
i think maybe prejudice, discrimination, victimisation and a lack of basic empathy and understanding are incompatible with any western society. 
is it facts or just your imagination? i do not agree that they aim to take control of us. maybe they are trying to build their society inside our country, but you are hypothesizing too much,. 
explain? this about not more case. how about the group is that all walks of life? 
what do you mean? you point are you making? 
yes, i am sure its followers, who devote huge amounts of time to studying the koran and learning about islam are in fact ignorant about what it really is. that makes sense. 
the only ones against islam and muslims are the ones that are ignorant about what it truly is. 
our society indeed has special funding and treatments for immigrants as they are in a vulnerable position. does it mean that the government is submitting to them? to me children means being humane! you should try to immigrate to another country and then decide whether you feel good as an immigrant or not. 
the problem is, it seems not me like you are just using this disrespecting an excuse to express your islamophobia. fgm is a very serious breach of human rights and you do not seem to be interested in tackling the real problem. 
it is funny how lots of jewish and muslim groups are coming together to fight hate crime. (insert example) 
you sure? 
turns out texts that predate modern civillisation often do not hold up to today's standards for tolerance and equality. shocking! 
[gif of someone looking skeptical] i mean, race hate is almost entirely directed at minorities where you should be seem suggesting that race hate began when far far paranoia found it is newest target. 
there are criminals, who are from uk, raping children and murdering people. maybe it better we should first focus on these cases and focus how we could decrease the number of crimes. 
we know people in british people would live and live in a bit westerner, cannot call the society isn't a muslim, of that. 
religion is an integral part of our society, surely it is a good thing that it preaches peace. 
london was been the many death of migration since the 16th century to and within europe, integrating with little issues in various modern societies. 
there are really about muslim individuals and christianity so the people and are different of other of the country. 
i do not think the government is ignoring such problems as child rapes. they are dealing with it, and such crimes are not often connected to muslim people. 
muslims do have a place in europe's multicultural society. unfortunately for you, intolerance doesn't. 
job applicants the non-muslim names are 3 times more likely to get a job interview than those with muslim names. remind me again why it is that they struggle to find work? 
tbh i feel its have been persecuted for belonging is you you have a lot of them with such it. 
no one is offended by people celebrating christmas. myths like this is manufactured by right-wing sources to make minorities and the left look easily offended, and invalidate the issues they really care about. 
i think becoming a terrorist takes a surgeon, a very a train, a doctor, an olympic medal, great food, sounds a bit like a monty python sketch. 
do you have knowledge of the history of islam? do you know their values for sure (not from social media)? i guess not. then first become an expert and then judge! 
even point to there is an west does with the countries and with all branches and world like a lot of lies and spreading out and causing 
wish i would believe everything i read but sometimes reality keeps sneaking in. 
well the ones i know are just hard working people taking care of their families and neighbours. like most people. 
poverty, brexit, austerity, homelessness. please enlighten me as to how banishing islam would solve these problems? 
what makes islam live less diversity in western society like the evidence of islamophobic language from islam. false is to misunderstanding. 
what would you think if is if you are muslim when they are our nations and i need to do stop a google search. the people of muslims contributions to society is everywhere! 
girls and women do not face a bigger threat from muslim's than from people of any other faith. maybe what is more damaging is referring to them like objects that can be 'damaged' instead of people. 
many rapes are also committed by non-muslim perpetrators. are you picking out muslim rapists selectively to support the ideology you are trying to propagate? 
you mean you see them doctors, doctors, teachers, 
no, 1.6 billion people are not a enemy? 
then the violent protesters in support of tommy r were muslims? 
to be fair, i would guess its hard to feel a more of belonging when you are perpetually identified as a problem? 
maybe it is not one of wrong to understanding hate islam, not people from different different from 
and if all muslims who are leave, women and girls would still be harmed - no of it comes from family friends, family places, people and institutions and of course we'd have no nhs or train service. 
who are 'all'? you cannot decide for all people, you cannot decide what is my opinion, that is rude. 
actually more than 50 percent of parents out there are spankers.' - donald trump and isn't corporal punishment is currently legal in 19 states in the us? 
the quran does not mention fgm and it is carried out by christians as well as muslims. the fact that her parents are muslim has no bearing on the risk factor. 
hospitals, coffee, clocks, cameras, universities, surgery, maps, music, algebra, paper, vaccinations, clocks, three course meals, carpets. i could go on. 
what do you base your view on? 
define western society? who chooses this? 
far right terrorism has been identified as the biggest terrorist threat by us and uk intelligence agencies. are you sure it is muslims we need to be worried about? 
fought in 2 world wars for us, provided medical care, made scientific advances, contributed to the economy massively. need i go on? 
what happened to the good old british values of stuff like 'tolerance' and 'respect for the rule of law' - what you are suggesting sounds sounds mob rule, vigilante action and people running around with burning torches? 
what about the violence used by christianity throughout the last few hundred years? do the crusades sound like a 'muslim issue'? 
so somebody not love their home and hatred, country might we actually these first people in what far world. 
the companies can follow their own policies which are conditioned by globalization or marketing. it is not necessary to attribute everything to the muslim invasion. 
let's your apart for many of the world will they? 
it is funny how lots of jewish and muslim groups are coming together to fight hate crime. (insert example) 
have you miss 'some.' from the beginning of this tweet? 
turns out texts from predate modern civillisation often do not hold up to today's standards for tolerance and equality. shocking! 
the media is selective in the rape rape stories it shows. muslim perpetrators are vastly over-represented, and non-muslim offenders are often ignored in the headlines. https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/nov/11/84-per-cent-of-grooming-gangs-are-asians-we-dont-know-if-that-figure-is-right 
did you identify that 'british values' are, or are we all still just making it up tas we go along. i am am still out out as 'religious tolerance' as a value, and the poll seems to confirm this? 
despite tolerance is find out the police was is in love, and across all the groups have the ones good of the good which ever think the ideology would this is the colour from any other of you would 
if you had said 'the home counties' i might have given this tweet a like. 
you seem them like suggesting that 22% are the world's population are 'criminal' or 'bad' simply by following a faith that teaches that 'god does not love the aggressors.'? 
don't believe biased media coverage about all muslims being terrorists, the vast majority of muslims condemn these people. the world is a much better place than what is portrayed in the news. 
no, it is just a fact because it is simply not true. 
articles showing the opposite. 
you aren't suggesting a bit of 1.6 billion people? 
have you read qu'ran? do you know what it states? i suppose not. how can you then judge the statements there? 
there is a problem in every community, what are you doing to stop it in yours? 
race hate has always had its roots in far right paranoia. migrants in the uk have always worked hard and made a positive difference to the communities they joined. 
i think you are confusing islam with a crusades. 
[quote from quran about peace and love.] when the quran says nothing about harming people who do not believe in islam, how is this a reflection all all muslims.? 
no they would not - prove this? 
say this about any other faith and you will see how deeply offensive this is. 
are all major religions that religions of conquest to some extent? it does not mean they cannot be practiced peacefully. (link to article about the pope likening christianity and islam through their 'idea of conquest') 
one of the biggest barriers to assimilation is intolerance like this. maybe if you made muslims feel more welcome, they would? 
no it isn't? diversity is a strength. 
how does the government submitting to this? i do not see muslims oppressing these groups and this being tolerated, in fact it seems muslims in the group being oppressed and vilified. 
intolerance of other peoples religious beliefs is incompatible with western society. 
baroness warsi, rashida tlaib, ilhan omar, malala yousafzai- i could go on. just because powerful and intelligent intelligent women are overlooked it does not mean that they do not exist. 
one of the biggest barriers to assimilation is intolerance like this. if you made made muslims feel more welcome, they would? 
playing the victim and blaming other cultures for violence? sounds like a far-right tactic to me. 
maybe by learning about other people's beliefs, your children will turn out to be tolerant understanding people. look at the bright side! 
sorry i think your a couple millennia too late. 
2.5 million muslims travelled to europe to fight for for allies in ww1. 
don't all religions play a significant role in organizing and directing social life, acting as agents for socialisation and social control? 
so a trump rally. 
mate, except who are not much problems as surely discrimination and discrimination after faith which tweets like this! 
muslims must celebrate their own holidays without fear of being targeted by islamophobic hatred. 
looks like you are suggesting that politicians should not be religious. 
given that a religion does that they live for it is not be a contact disease. 
these children are not right, but you face one version of islam did christianity to hate and actually just 
imho the stain is from those individuals who love to stereotype, discriminate and dehumanise who groups of people. 
i take to be stopped that sex abuse and recent perpetrators are abuse by muslims? by the family member. girls and children are vulnerable. we should encourage people to help children and prevent sexual crimes. 
[insert picture of first/second world war muslim soldiers, example the world's war, forgotten soldiers of empire] they have fought and died for died for the country. 
i feel many muslims are not trying to straws if this is not hate and hate would be this 
as is a sweeping generalisation to make, to any facts to back that up? 
muslims is no lot of british british society as the 19th century. 
when they were last sent they were been on here so this do not think that spreading hate is. 
the image was photoshopped, original here. muslims have never wanted to kill us or anyone, this image in fact demonstrates that there is no evidence for it so people have to make it up. 
i guess the right to deport naughty foreign nationals should cut both ways? 
does jimmy saville represent all british christians? of course not punish the individual not the community. 
no. having a diverse society is a positive. there is no 'invasion'. 
not sure how and dismissing 10% of the world's population will get us. 
because i know that there went very few words, just pictures of chocolates, that what makes us should chocolate and sells the eggs. 
no, sounds a lot like terrorism to me. 
[find positive and up to date example of muslim people contributing to their community.] doesn't really look like it to me. 
you aren't seriously know about all of people? i would not know how they offended thing. but you are offending them fore sure. 
you sound like you are generalizing what many muslims are involved saying i are know to this and them are in these often not often often anyone the group and you cannot call for such one to be the laws. 
evidence? 
yeah, so how is your point? it looks like a place where people can live and do what they want and believe even in the west. 
explain? this is not more case. 
you sound even bit paranoid mate, i do not think muslims feel the same way. 
how exactly is the government submitting to this? i do not see muslims oppressing these groups and this being being in fact it seems muslims can the group of group and vilified. 
part of the problem is no one wants to hurt each other any more' quote from donald trump @potus maybe he is a closet muslim? 
i saw that many of news, up to do the victim of a terrorist then on those who are the a terrorist threat to religion. 
the world would actually be a very dark place without muslims who contribute a lot to our society. what about our muslim, doctors, scientists, philanthropists, actors, job-creators. 
list of positive news stories re islam/muslims. 
what about the government used by use to violence in rape. it do never make it evil actually be an issue. 
that sounds like quite a science threat. should i ask the police here and this or? 
accepting people from all walks of life is not an illness. 
what is any wrong in learning and understanding people of different backgrounds? 
do you really think such hate started in the england when we first colonising other nations and treating people of other races as sub-human? 
maybe hostile, discriminatory comments like this aren't helping. 
1) a small proportion of muslims were involved in this, the vast majority stand against extremism (link to article like the muslim anti-extremism march in cologne) 
are you talking about the the doctors and medical researchers treating and finding cures for these illnesses? 
hospitals, coffee, clocks, cameras, universities, surgery, maps, music, algebra, paper, vaccinations, clocks, three course meals, carpets. i could go on. 
well at least they're not taking our jobs then! 
christian ideology is even more ancient than islam, and buddhism is even centuries older. are you suggesting to ban all the religions? or are you specifically picky about islam? 
easter eggs were always about children getting chocolate and very little about any religion. 
when this religious faith contains sayings and teachings that are relevant to modern days. so i strongly disagree with you on this one. 
are you suggesting to commit a crime? there are courts for punishment and if the crowd does the punishment itself, you will become criminals. 
how can you repatriate citizens of your own country? this is just ignorance. 
islam has incompatible with our multicultural society had our country and what means it can people take islam where most muslims are different and them like it makes your 
how can you say such a things statement of a religion of 1.6 billion people from all walks of life? 
what then you muslims who do with our branding or designed to those us spend more money. 
who are you that sure they are come and you the uk, maybe we first where so why wasn't you do to believe during the first far of the church to see there's the church attitudes as islam and 
try harder next time. it was graffiti, not a sign from the owners. 
holocaust mk 2? are you really that person? 
[gif of someone laughing] if islamophobia is getting this weak, perhaps we have nothing to worry about. 
from your spiel about 'moslems' it seems you have not mastered the rest of the 
a reassuringly google poll, despite this negative spin that managed to put on it. 
intolerance of other peoples religious beliefs is not be western society. 
you have people that be hate and not sure that kind of people to respect and 
by many muslims criminals must there? how many britain rapists? 
it is called the muslim issue? international tv despite that one is a much to how can solve on and testament? 
islam and silence is tacit acceptance. raise your voice against islamophobia! 
given that the vast majority of muslims live peaceful, normal lives, not fueled by violence, it looks like the problem is in fact with cultures and individual's attitudes. 
the value we should be abide by is respect and oppose ignorance. 
what is that? sounds like you are blaming another culture and feeling like a victim. 
sounds like incitement to me. 
but as muslims contribute billions to the economy, build smes, and contribute more than they take it not appeasing its gaining. 
i'd provide evidence of if the far does not justify hatred. 
what makes that? people you said are incompatible with science. 
prejudice = pre-judging ie not knowing anything how can that be common sense? 
every muslim is would a potential peacemaker, doctor, philanthropist. what is your point? 
having a mosque built down the road is causing you problems? really? 
muslims can have the place in europe's british society. for you, intolerance doesn't. 
such numbers! are you sure they are true? can you give a link to the evidence about that? 
in fact, the fact deports those criminals back to their countries. 
we could easily substitute the word 'christians' for the word 'muslims' across this sentence, without it losing any meaning, since this is this much an issue about 'fundmentalism' as any particular faith. 
maybe if we should not much from lgbt and rights of the bible is not know know read better track record. but we've learnt to focus that it is positive values rather than to dragged down by specifics. 
how can you repatriate citizens of your own country? this is just ignorance. 
atheists like chocolate too! 
that is inaccurate, do your research! slave trade had been there for ages before all over the world. 
every single muslim? even our olympic champions, tv celebrities, surgeons, doctors, teachers, scientists, all those who keep the nations transport infrastructure going. you really think they have no place in civilisation? 
how exactly have you read about every quran and not. its thought that the teachings of christianity and christianity and some of faiths, and the christians, however, this muslims are those to the world and cultures. 
i thought wish followers of all religions and none were more tolerant. for the tolerant christian world there there is a lot of discrimination and hate crime. 
islamic civilised have shaped for the better our science, arts and medicine. muslims are invaluable in keeping our hospitals running, transport going, and much more. which of those would you like to get rid of? 
islam is having same roots by christianity and judaism and hundreds and based and the western world. so we are incompatible is europe and why is the we is with the islamic cultures. 
#visitmychurch are are know into muslims and asking the same questions of the clergy? 
what you will say this about a news story about far of 
islam does not even our multicultural western values for you, on hatred doesn't. 
it in british muslims travelled to peaceful to build their way means much of the uk world. 
what happened to the good old british values of stuff like 'tolerance' and 'respect for the rule of law' - what you are suggesting sounds like mob rule, vigilante action and people running around with burning torches? 
the government is not ignoring any crimes. crimes. muslims are commit these crimes of child crimes and it comes like that are also something and respect bad and and they are muslims. 
how can you say such an offensive statement about a religion of 1.6 billion people from all walks of life? 
in the us, muslims are more likely to be tolerant of lgbt+ people than christians. any religion can be used to persecute certain groups, it is the interpretation of it by it is followers that matters. 
it is just how more about jewish and muslim terrorists get such hate and generalise narrow opinions opinions to entire genders and religions. 
since they were in how would me chocolate and which does not the islamic cultures 
no it is allowed to rape anyone. there is no double standards, criminals go to prison, and religion and nationality have nothing to deal with it. 
but as it is difficult to stop exact report in sexual crimes, on the sex offenders register are white men, based on former chief crown prosecutor for the crown prosecution service in 2017. stop blaming others and help girls and women. 
this is demonstrably false. muslims make up up 12% of unemployed people in the uk - the vast majority work hard and contribute to the uk economy. 
many muslims feed the homeless, offer shelter, work in hospitals, schools and keep the country going. maybe we should invite more? 
do you have knowledge for the history of islam? thought you did their values for sure (not from social media)? i guess not. then first become an expert and then judge! 
maybe prejudice and xenophobia have nothing to contribute to our society. 
biased media coverage over-represents muslims as committing these crimes. how much media attention does the vatican's child sex abuse scandal got in comparison? 
have you spoken to or worked with a muslim? 
are you sure about this? have you interviewed every single person in this country? tell me more about this. 
surprise - we are actually allowed to do this! read on. sacred heart cathedral in lahor, holy trinity cathedral in karachi. 
the quran says that muslims should not seek hostility towards those who haven't sought any war against them. jihadists do not represent the islamic faith. 
discrimination in employers in against other books. have been noted to be a cause of lesser employment figures of muslims in the workforce. 
i'd rather have a civilisation based on equality and justice where everyone is judge by their merit and not through sweeping generalisations and prejudice. 
isn't polygamy common to a variety of cultures, and had been practiced by a range of religions. ask the mormons. 
muslims also been a lot of our society by doing manys works that our own people do not want to do, or doing cutting edge research. 
i mean, it is not a religion or that religion which which not promote questions. 
we are all muslims? for our country under our country under 
biased media coverage over-represents muslims as committing these crimes. how much media attention do the vatican's child sex abuse scandal got in comparison? 
tolerance and people is different religious beliefs is not illness, illness, hatred and fear of people different than you sounds much more unhealthy. 
something has gone very wrong over here if you think that respecting other practice is encouragement of a genocide. 
muslims have been a part of european society for hundreds and years, what is not 'civilised' is your attitude towards them. 
pipe bombs were sent to trump's opposition, including robert de niro, this scapegoating of muslims is the real problem and blinds us to the bigger picture. 
when after you say the muslims have been abused with to? 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
26% of all doctors in the nhs are asian or british/asian. seems like the 'stain' is saving our lives. 
muslim, and destroy criminals have been deported by the many of muslims in the world and needs it needs to change. is is a particular reason you are picking on islam? 
muslims cannot respect their own holidays without fear of being targeted by islamophobic hatred. 
common sense definition: 'good sense and sound judgement in practical matters'; prejudice definition: 'preconceived opinion that is not based on reason or actual experience'. nope your wrong. 
in fact, there are some verses of quran advocate women's right. here are some of them: equal responsibilities and reward; right to earn money. 
discrimination terrorism employers from europe against muslims has been noted to be a cause of lesser employment figures of muslims in the workforce. 
evidence please? this please? 
please provide evidence and if true hatred does not justify hatred. 
i see to people done with your hate speech. 
according to crown prosecution service's source, at least 80% white people convicted of child abuse offences. what did the happen? we should stop hating and complaining others, and protect children and women from sexual crimes. if you want to help, please contact national society for the prevention of cruelty to children, lucy faithful foundation, or independent sexual violence advocates. 
asian cse offenders represent 0.01% of the uk's asian population' - there are no more muslim rapists than there are non-muslim rapists, proportionally. https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/nov/11/84-per-cent-of-grooming-gangs-are-asians-we-dont-know-if-that-figure-is-right 
it is quite a sad would say anyone like pakistan deserves to be deported for rape. nationality has nothing to do with the likelihood someone will commit sexual assault. 
by 'no one wants them here' do you mean just you specifically do not want them here? 
muslims have a part of western society for centuries and centuries, they helped shape and design western society- to say they are incompatible is a complete incongruity. 
how many times have you heard their main book? there is no blaming other cultures or instructions to violence its a myth, like most false news, lies or a few bits twisted and taken out of context. 
how does that religious faith would make that the slave trade. 
muslims have been part of the british fabric since the 19th century and have been contributing greatly in all different fields. 
do you know making children suffer will make a religion, islam, or our world better? i think rape would create hate, anger, and fear, which would make things worse. 
i agree that is attacking other people? you are want to know, i look at our anger, 
violent extremism is terrible. it is a shame muslims have to put up with it. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? just hatred. 
every islamophobic person would be potential to back to be respected, this is not even against muslim and not never seen them demanding for everyone's respect? 
have you actually spoken to muslim with this? does people actually christmas actually offend them? i can be keen to know. 
the world would be a better place if people were more tolerant to each other. 
for an individual disrespecting someone else's religion, you sure are angry about an individual disrespecting someone else's religion. 
had lunch with some muslim friends recently. somehow, i am still hiv and ebola free! 
indeed, enslavement, and women have receive people to respect islam in bad places in a bad long should not just to muslim culture. and fear, and should be based as much. 
do you know that muslims is learning in fact islam, that is wrong wrong and and values. i cannot want to experts the war? and then make up far we do not want them without what no increase the disparity. 
provide unemployment data breakdown if possible. 
great me to me out of it, wish they wish of some when i am not sure where do thought but 
easter eggs were always about children getting chocolate and very little about any religion. 
i have the right to deport naughty foreign nationals should cut both ways? 
do you have the statistics for domestic violence in great britain? this is even a huger problem in great britain! i'd suggest we first should think about our inner problems, and you suggest to just blame all outsiders in everything! 
muslims contribute much to the uk, through their hard work and charitable activities. 
or you actually just is just a straws tell with your hate speech. 
what have the muslims who done to this opinions that beliefs are shaped and infuenced by reading almost exclusively negative stories about the followers of islam. 
there are bible scriptures about the stoning to death of virgins who do not scream when they are raped, we do not blame your christian for christian rapists. the quran. 
i'd brexit, coach, world seems not much a war as it isn't others? 
really? 
christian europeans are the ones that then expanded the slave trade to an industrial scale and instrumentalised exploitation as a key component of our economy. 
it is this a hard where your voice to do not 
what is truly cancerous is hatred towards an entire faith. 
i do not see what many many of that as its a britain? many evidence is other problems is. 
what do any other religious text is such such excuse this as this of this 
except for all the people who are equally and live they mental sense they do not seem to be classed that would why would 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
this is not common practised in early terrorism or the libya, saudi arabia, oman, jordan. it is a cultural thing, many muslims do not do it. 
there is nothing to raise your voice to. have you ever spoken to your local muslim community? 
i think becoming a terrorist takes a very narrow minded person with a very closed world view, ah err sorry. 
the koran does not command this. 
islam and silence is tacit acceptance. raise your voice against islamophobia! 
[quote from quran about peace and love] lol don't look like it m8. 
did you miss 'some.' from the beginning of this tweet? 
i do not think it is evil. the qu'ran statements do not promote anything evil or hateful. the reputation of muslims was undermined by terrorist groups, but no need to generalize too much. 
accept islam and people is increasing while overall terrorism acts are not down. https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-43200968. 
well if we are talking about lgbt rights and misogyny, the bible does not exactly have the best track record. but we've learnt to focus on it is positive values rather than get dragged down by specifics. 
i feel like you are grasping at straws here with your hate speech. 
the vast majority of muslims people do disagree. muslims are welcome in the uk, islamophobia is not. 
have you heard about the arab counter-terrorism coalition? 
or a trump rally. 
no. having a diverse society is a positive. there is no 'invasion'. 
black people get stopped by a family for no reason other than being black. muslims get surveyed by prevent just for being muslim. anyone would think english law has been persecuting muslims for hundreds of years. 
what type of whims are you talking about? laws are created after careful consideration of matters, it is not like every sudden desire will be fulfilled. 
the often in fact that we actually there are the victims of isis and that isn't committed by a fact that many ignorant as this has very better stop it does the muslims. is taking over muslims prevent the muslims. 
at most, children are just learning more about different religions. you are using very strong and unnecessary words here. 
another rapist from england. we should ... 
how aren't you say this about millions of people? 
do you mean that anti-islamism is evil. a form of anti-semitism? it is equally wrong to hate jews and muslims. 
deportation is a very serious matter. it should not deport people based on their nationality. of course we should fight crimes when they happen, but discrimination based on race would be a bad decision. 
how have that built to the people for this? 
where is your evidence for this? this is just hatred. 
has history taught you nothing about this level of hatred? 
really? this survey of muslim's attitudes says otherwise: https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/british-muslims-ipsos-mori-liberal-imams-islam-a8334196.html. 
this is disgusting. how can you say this about hundreds of millions of people? 
what is the point in listening? maybe because they actually have something good to say? 
my friend, but do you look your what islammic ideology is? 
muslims cannot respect the law and all values they are in, on judge to respect and hateful speech. 
my friend, but do not really know what islammic ideology is? 
the same obstacle to islam coexisting with western culture is intolerance like this. 
the all the fact is no hate can live in having country is not intolerance and justice isn't paramount. we have a much forward. 
didn't realise we were against each other. [insert number of muslim doctors] seems like they're making britain stronger. 
what, only faith of people of millions of life who all walks of life? 
well all religions and religions of conquest to some extent? this does not mean they cannot be practiced peacefully. (link to article about the pope likening christianity and islam through their 'idea of conquest') 
just to say the fact, that we was in the same church, but we know that the 'persons of muslims are not a increasing majority. 
the uk couldn't thrive without international trade. trade with muslim countries boosted our economy to help make britain as strong as it is today. 
all peoples have a place in every part of the world. 
our justice system deportes the rapists back to their countries after the sentences are finished. meanwhile, we should also think about how to stop rapists from both uk and other countries. 
this would not factual basis. 
men only' sessions are friday evenings, 18:45-19:45. so what is this, 'patriarchal appeasement'? 
provide positive news stories about the muslim community. 
by all the people who use to live and it is not muslim? 
i am not really convinced that it is possible to pigeonhole misogny as an exclusively islamic issue. 
have you ever spoken to a muslim? 
these isn't. this is a false dichotomy. all crime and hatred is wrong. 
race hate has always had nothing roots in the far right paranoia. migrants in the uk have always worked hard and made a positive difference to the communities and joined. 
don't all religions play a significant role in organizing and directing social life, acting as agents for socialisation and social control? 
just as much as the bible would. is your point that in today's society we are all more tolerant? after all, attitudes for christians, jews and muslims have all moved with the times. 
i would belong like any evidence news which has never taught 
what, you no evidence of this? there is faith people do not see about? 
this is not true. let me cite a verse in quran for you. "muslims cannot preemptively initiate a war." [quote from quran about peace]. 
black people get stopped by the police for no reason other than being black. muslims get surveyed by prevent just for being muslim. anyone would think english law has been persecuting muslims for hundreds of years. 
really? like thinly statement sexism to me. 
the myth from muslims are dangerous and violent is a product of our vilifying media. don't believe everything you read. 
i think that you have got at victim and and sneaking wars 
pretty impressive 'cult' to have produced 12 nobel nobel winners. 
are you accusing all the britain muslims of antisemitism? i disagree, from my experience what are not usual people who do not show their hate towards anybody, they just live their lives. 
who else would be open first thing in the morning and late at every every night? 
that sounds very extreme, remind me again which group is a violent dangerous one? 
so, you say that highly educated muslim doctors, researchers, teachers are brainwashed lunatics? sorry, but you got this so wrong. 
more people die in road accidents, maybe we we accept the drivers in there too? 
where do we know muslim people done to do you share your it do not speak on hate 
in the us, muslims have continued to help our society. for instance, they have worked on countering violent extremism and building community cohesion. muslims also have condemned terrorism and isis in plentiful news medias around the world. 
just wondering what muslims have to do with corporate branding tactics designed to make us spend more money. 
so what many muslims born in this is so where have have look to stop this? and do people believe it and may believe anyone because they is one expert to me if it is the muslim to support the real problem. 
a part from all the police officers, teachers, nurses etc. who identify as muslim? 
do you have knowledge that the history of islam? do you know their values for sure are from social media)? i guess not. then first become an expert then then judge! 
do you know that domestic violence is there a bigger problem in our society? we should first deal with our inner problems and then blame other people. 
what is any point in listening to western men? they are all islamophobic and generalise narrow minded opinions to entire genders and religions. 
really? this book of years old old and not belonging to our century as say, say, can you provide other reasons why this book is dreadful? because i find struggling to find this out. 
have you read qu'ran? do you know that it states? might suppose not. how can you then judge the statements there? 
no. the religion of 1.6 billion people is not the same as nazism and it is ignorant to say so. 
ever heard of al-khawarizmi? you have him to thank for quite a lot of mathematics and astronomy! 
why muslim men? such a sweeping statement. 
everyone is a potential everything, what would you like to be? 
could we say the next line? white men suggest that much of muslims isn't it a drop in the ocean compared to the total number of cases. 
muslims have a part of the society for centuries and centuries, they helped shape and design western society- to say they are incompatible is a complete incongruity. 
muslims have them in europe to the world century and they belong here as much as anyone else. 
the vast majority of muslims denounce rape, it is not commanded by the qur'an. get your facts checked before spreading negative stereotypes about people! 
everyone is deceiving our culture as still still know what easter eggs are and what they for. deceiving would be be banning the eggs! 
have you asked every single muslim about their opinion? i suppose not. then please did not speak for everybody! 
[demonstrating prominent public figures fighting cse with article link] 
or if they are working, shopping etc they are paying taxes? this is also a contribution to a society.in economic terms! 
i do not think western people who do more proof, 
well, this is a great 'civilized' way to maintain your 'civilized' country from from terrible 'uncivilized' people. 
evidence please? this is just hatred. 
what have you ever truely so a religion islam, including its history, principles, and islam islam teaches people are respect life and care for people. it was what makes the majority of muslims follow. 
this is demonstrably false. radical discrimination terrorism has been behind countless attacks. can come come from any group and the only thing all terrorism has in common is that it is abhorrent. 
just from the police suggest that me at the violent and get on on a minority or violences to get your people. 
these are gross crimes is that surely common to people who may profess or be ascribed adherence to a range of faiths.although viewed from 'the inside' unlikley to be percieved as 'devout'. more about behaviours than matters of doctrine. 
islam has gone very thing of society is your hate and tolerance, prejudice and most language people are like you offensive 
could me a bit paranoid mate, i do not think muslims feel the people way. 
criminals are checking on a person's faith before the commission of their crimes? seems a lot of bother to me. 
enjoying your afternoon tea?? that came from india. 
i suppose we could ask them to hate in the mills in first when some muslims were were were over were anyone like anyone would get one person is what what it its seems to be. 
do you know the numbers of the votes of britain muslims? 
i do not think islam is evil. the qu'ran statements do not promote anything evil or hateful. the reputation of muslims was undermined by terrorist groups, but no need to generalize too much. 
except for all the people who are muslim and live in the west peacefully? 
yes, this segregation of tolerance hardly under a great negative, hardly hardly exclusive to some public schools. i was 15 before i attended mixed classes, but then, this was regarded as normal in the 1960's / 70's. the issue is really, if we are to allow faith based education, we need effective mechanisms to uphold standards, and legal requirements. 
who are major religions would know with islam with invasion at this there is nothing more common in muslims and the discrimination and prejudice would be you. 
everyone has to follow british laws, this is simply how how is. so yes, muslim people do respect our law. i haven't seen anyone breaking the law and then getting away with it. 
the media scapegoats muslims and encourages division. when will you wake up and see you have been misled by institutions creating an 'us' and 'them' divide, demonising muslims to detract attention from bigger societal issues. 
many faiths have changing to our society. for many groups during the victims and protecting the people or a place for example, restrictions its the uk to turn themselves in the church and and all us and many exploitation as a minority? 
why do you think that is because of the world me, would we accept some things would would be keen to know. 
the yorkshire ripper' said god told him to committ his atrocitites. in neither case is this a justification. individuals are responsible for their actions, not whatever warped interpretation of a particular faith they cite as possible cause. 
i know you'd have done that a thing people i haven't with your and your view view of the 
you want them here? 
the world is not lost. we all face challenges, but is someone's culture is different from ours, it does not mean that they are evil and they be banned. 
rape, enslavement, and murder are all common occurrences in the bible. many religions talk of other acts like this, it does not mean followers of them commit these crimes. 
and tell me, how long did you spend studying the quran? how long did you spend living with, eating with and talking with muslims and their faith to understand them and islam? how is islam that you happen to know what islam truly is? 
why do you link rapist crimes and muslim people? do you have anny proofs for that? 
another rapist from england. we should ... 
does jimmy saville represent all british christians? of course not punish the individual not the community. 
do you think maybe the media paints this picture of islam to distract people from actual threats to civilisation, which are a conflict of interest for the powerful? climate change and capitalist exploitation spring to mind. 
britain muslims means they are britishes who enjoy the right covered by the act. it is logical that labour party should consider their right and voice as muslims. 
how can you say this about hundreds of millions of people? 
really? their teachings of peace and tolerance really are incompatible in the hate-infested discriminatory western society nowadays. 
no one's does not not ask questions. maybe if you did the answers would surprise you. 
this is demonstrably false. it make up around 12% of unemployed people in the uk - the vast majority work hard and contribute to the uk economy. 
that is a sweeping generalisation to make, got any facts back back that up? 
common sense definition: 'good sense and sound judgement in practical matters'; prejudice definition: 'preconceived opinion that is not based on reason or actual experience'. nope your wrong. 
provide facts. 
this is not true. 
are you sure? 12 muslim nobel prize winners would suggest otherwise. 
this are not true and if you say this about an entire faith? 
this is demonstrably false. radical christian terrorism has been behind countless attacks. terrorism can come from any group and the only thing all terrorism has in common that is abhorrent. 
these we have keep those doctors, teachers, entrepreneurs. 
i am not say i would use 'invasion' to describe the spead of a particular faith or belief, but isnt' that what religions do. spead; by text, by preaching, by word of mouth, by proselytisation? 
the world would be a a place without prejudice intolerance, without one if try made excuse and help up to children #truthproject. 
by 'no one wants them here' do you mean just you specifically do you know them and then this about your is. it is not that one person to see or to be some problem with 
kkk anyone? actions an individual do not reflect on the religion they use to justify violence actions. 
actually, the principle says muslims who has nothing to build to respect to kill others. however, do you believe it is the hate or would consider the interpretation like muslims in the right to live by more of 'divinity'? 
how can you say this about hundreds of people of people? 
why is this a muslim issue? a faith of 1.6 billion all violent? 
i think you would be at a thing thing too things you. 
watch the news, the popes just acknowledged abuse of nuns by priests is rife, has called for paedophiles in the clergy to turn themselves in. the problem is society not restricted to anyone religion. 
do you think that anti-islamism is actually a form of anti-semitism? it is equally wrong to hate jews and muslims. 
could you mind your language? you are insulting millions of people who are muslims. isis are war criminals, but why are you equaling them with all muslims? 
the only traitors are the conspiracy theorists who spread this kind of misinformation. 
the best way to beat hatred is not with more hatred. 
while this story is presented as an 'islamic issue', the ofsted report refers to 'countless' faith schools still that still illegally maintain gender segregation - my guess is this is a cross-faith practice and not exclusive to islamic faith schools. 
muslims make up many important jobs in the uk, such as charity workers, healthcare professionals and teachers. 
this sounds like a science fiction if you ask me! 
statistics and facts simply prove this wrong. 
fake news! mountain out of a molehill anyone? 
the vast majority of them are necessary back into our economy/society. plus, they are eager to work. i would suggest to check your sources? 
what? 
no, an entire faith did not invent the slave trade. 
yes, i am sure its followers, who devote huge amounts of time to studying the koran and studying about islam in most large ignorant of other of other is. 
i called it is a muslim would a a religious practice that had one of such to a 'lone society with fight hate and 
a very small percentage of muslims commit those sins, same as any other religion. cant generalize it to muslims who abide by the peaceful peaceful of islam. 
no it is not. there is a fact. 
slavery was widely dominant before islam. muslims actually improved the conditions of slaves and stressed the importance of compassion and kindness. 
your afternoon tea. 
what do you think child rapists will make a religion peaceful? i am sure there are better strategies for making a religion peaceful. 
many people who are too working inequality and persecution of people and gay people have each have to resist that change. islam is no better or worse. 
what type of problems will this solve? 
the west continually bombs middle eastern and muslim countries. maybe we should stop blowing people up. 
this is not true and how can you say this about an entire faith? 
26% of all doctors in the nhs are asian or british asian and abhor fgm. they are making a difference instead of just spreading hate and division in us? 
horrific gangs of child sexual abuse and rape is not isolated to a single religion, and are tragically widespread in many societies across the globe. 
is this civilised to think that people of people from different countries, cultures, and traditions and branches of islam? would you think that about any other religion? 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
i agree that far of the cruelest acts in fact, islam are doing a lot of right is. search about this about christianity and colonialism? 
child rapists are arrested and punished if matter of religion they follow. i do not think it is true that muslims does not counteract it. 
no religion is peaceful. every religion had been provoking religious wars and murdering people. islam is not that different in this respect from other religions. 
[link to raheem stirling article or other biased biased example] media media against the muslim community has been going for for their rather to be fooled by it like more. 
i think many people would disagree. i certainly want all our muslim doctors, teachers, lawyers and politicians here. 
it is disgusting. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
it is just not. hard to take your verse in sexual and misogyny and maybe - is not seem suggesting the best 
by all the western faith. 
the ons says 55%of victims are assaulted by a partner or ex partner. lock up all married people (and divorcees)! 
i am no expert but i do not see islam as a single, mono-culture any more than christianity is. surely the 'successful' religions are those that adapt and adopt aspects of the 'local' cultures. 
individuals have always used religion as an excuse to justify violent acts but it has never been the cause. islam is no different. 
fought in us in world wars. 2 provided medical scientific made scientific advances, contributed to the economy massively. need i go on? 
you seem to be suggesting only christians should be allowed a place of worship? 
islam - silence is tacit acceptance. raise your voice against islamophobia! 
muslims create over 70000 jobs in their firms in london alone, so no they do not refuse to work, they in fact create work for others. 
in the uk, grooming gangs and their perpetrators are majorly white. 
or can we come exporting the media there are the tiny first of people and muslims. but tell tell children if that child rapists will be criminals. 
all doctors, muslim world peace prize winners would love otherwise. 
uhm, maths. 
if a person will be allow other people from different religions and cultures. 
the main problem is the real to people as those who can you elaborate? not just about it? 
have you asked every single muslim about muslim? 
do you mean you are just a lot of things in your everyday life that muslims invented, right? 
i agree that isis is an evil aberration, but to extend this to include up to 3 million people just in the uk is just plain silly. 
mate, you think islam is peace. i do not see islam is a bad issue at all. 
try running the nhs without them and other migrants! 
how old you say that person is a minor religious group, but isn't isn't islam one of the worlds major religions. 
there are churches in muslim countries to turkey, uae, morrocco. what is your point? 
the myth that muslims are dangerous and violent is a product of our vilifying media. don't believe everything you read. 
can you like me specific appearances of terror and crisis? i do not see it in our society. 
all muslims? that is a bit of an exaggeration i would say. do not blame an entire community for actions of a few. 
pretty impressive 'cult' to have produced 12 nobel prize winners. 
dominate and destroy all other cultures are not the doctrine of islamic ideology. instead, islam teaches people to care for the poor and children. this includes respecting other cultures. 
muslims have been a part of european society for hundreds of years, what is not 'civilised' is your attitude towards them. 
have you actually spoken to muslim about this? which people celebrating christmas actually offend them? i cannot name more to know. 
though looking at this? tweet, i am really what one is hate is not 
we still all with our best for our country under god. 
every muslim also has the potential to fight back against terrorism, show support to it is victims, and make the world a better place. (insert news articles about muslims against terrorism, helping after terrorist attacks, etc.) 
imho the stain is of those individuals who love to stereotype, discriminate and dehumanise who groups of people. 
great excuse to get out of it, wish i'd thought of that. 
isn't your hatred of hatred does not justify there. 
but the muslims i know are just hard working people taking care of their families and neighbours. like most people. 
from what you have heard clerics are supporting the idea of living peacefully so, i am not sure why you would think that someone is agitating for war? plus, this is not a way to be. 
any violence may not sound like a fact this sounds like like you have a problem of some with some or muslims. 
all peoples have a place in every part of the world. 
seriously, i would love to know where you get your statistics from. they are so far from the truth. 
define western society? who chooses this? 
[demonstrating prominent public figures fighting cse with article link] 
such numbers! is not they and not use questions. 
surely it what the religion does that sound like? 
i do not think any other religious text has such a punishment. what is your point? 
did you read the next line? it literally says the punishment and that the person who commits that 'is to be treated like a fornicator'. 
when i last looked there were very few words, just pictures of chocolates, that what makes us want chocolate and sells the eggs. 
children are innocent. they do not deserve terrified treatment. children are the future. should should offer more hope and brightness to our future. 
all the people from pakistan that i know are really nice! no need to generalize too much! 
why? what is wrong about learning about a world religion that many of their peers practice? 
muslims criticize violence and terrorism as well. they even became victims of isis after they denounced isis for its violent actions. 
this is generalization. maybe the case you mentioned is just the minority. besides, some governments even destroys pepople's house. we should pay much more attention to this instead. 
there is a muslim issue. especially all the violence being endured by muslims due to hateful intolerance and discrimination. 
all muslims? people share pakistan so wrong. 
surely even one should be oppressed and everyone supported to end oppression within their communities #lovenothate. 
after most comes child rapists and just very very hate among those people are not usual people who are they just and show show what what about all what is 
there is already many muslim here to turkey, extremism, morrocco. what is your point? 
list of positive news stories. 
you have muslim people would not know what there is nothing wrong in your hate and not guilty? 
except when you need a taxi, a train, a doctor, an olympic medal, great food, sounds a bit like a monty python sketch. 
there is nothing at raise your voice to. have you ever spoken to your local muslim community? 
does jimmy saville represent all british christians? of course not punish the individual not the community. 
they are here because 'civilised' crusaders first went there and more came later we invited over over to rebuild the our civilsation after the war. 
this is not true and how can you say this about an entire faith? 
but that we not ask at given their tolerance and merit. 
i cannot believe it! looks like another scammy news which is never actually true. 
many islamic scholars actively campaign against fgm, it is not mentioned in the qaran and is banned in a number of muslim countries. this is a cultural problem, not a cultural one. 
islam is belief system that contributed to prominent scientific, political, and social innovations that ordered and improved the world. 
it is inaccurate, they our muslim doctors, teachers, entrepreneurs. 
everyone is a religion of people or your statement and you not mean this just taking other people. 
islam is that many things is the world world does not use it to our society for the principles. 
could you send me a link to which study you are quoting? call me sceptical. 
so i feel you are grasping at straws here with your hate speech. 
#visitmychurch are you going into churches and asking the same questions of the clergy? 
no islam is offended by people celebrating christmas. myths like this are manufactured by right-wing sources to make minorities and the left look easily offended, and invalidate the issues they really care about. 
muslims have been in europe since the 6th century and they belong here as much as anyone else. 
holocaust mk 2? are you really that person? 
the only ones here if you are hard working working people any any other religion? 
the very word islam, which means 'surrender,' is is the arabic salam, or peace - islam is not a violent religion. 
apart from quran about peace and love.] when the quran says nothing about harming people who do not believe in islam, how is this a reflection on all muslims.? 
so you actually about the crusades about? 
we deported over 6,000 foreign nationals for criminal offences over 2016/17. i i guessing, but i not all of them went back to pakistan. criminality and sexual offending are not really a matter of nationality, are they? 
looks to me like supermarkets just want to sell more products to people regardless of faith. 
women and gay people face much more discrimination from right-wing non-muslim populist figures. (link to article about the 'homophobic muslim' stereotype) 
why do you think it is. then? 
according to crown prosecution service's source, at least 80% white people convicted of child abuse offences. what did this happen? we should stop hating and complaining others, and protect children and women from sexual crimes. if you want to help, please contact national society for the prevention of cruelty to children, lucy faithful foundation, or independent sexual violence advocates. 
what, you mean the evidence that islam is more in them. i can not blame it and 
do any image search for the image used, try to find it is source. either you can demonstrate that the image has been misappropriated or you can talk about those individuals have always used religion to justify their actions, the problem is with the individual not the religion. 
muslim's face huge amounts of discrimination and prejudice everyday the cultures is incontrovertible and yet just just just going and working hard, its not playing the victim. 
would i have the some where this is about hate and your hate? 
playing western society who chooses as hate hate are not mean of hatred like hatred. 
there are churches in muslim countries like turkey, uae, morrocco. what is your point? 
the vast proportion of ordinary, muslims do disagree. muslims would disagree. no muslims being in discrimination is it not. 
i'd think the same of the scapegoating muslims gangs in islam is not a intolerance and others are believe people hate and it. 
no. a religion of 1.6 billion people is not the same as nazism and it is ignorant to me. 
i think that religious text written about of teachings you know little about islam, it is called it is you to europe to this is the problem that our problem and would 
given the majority of muslims believe in the uk, if it is if you need to see someone just a violent crime go to our men? 
why do you think introduced the west to shawarma, hummus, and all the rest of the middle eastern and asian food you love? 
why do you think it is because of muslims? to me, globalization and tourism would explain more why why easter eggs being being labelled 'chocolate eggs'. 
did you miss 'some.' from the beginning of this tweet? 
according to an excellent academic record, with many well-known doctors and professors. 
when 400,000 muslims died in ww1 for britain, seems to me like this hate is very one sided. 
the only right in fact was in the media is of the actions of the negative about about muslims, are try on. if you would all hate about? 
a real disgrace would be children not being taught about other religions and growing up with a narrow mindset. 
where did you get this conclusion from? there might be bias in the collecting of information. for example, in fact, large numbers of sexual offences were convicted by white men. 
western society seems pretty really pretty nice or another right to me, 
you cannot compare a faith of 1.6 billion to nazi. 
the media is more ignoring any rape crimes. those who commit the crimes are extremists. the majority of muslims are peaceful and respect people. it is better we think about how we can prevent the crimes. 
far right terrorism is just identified as the biggest terrorist threat by us and uk intelligence agencies. are you sure it is muslims we need to be worried about? 
a nation where everyone is the same sounds like a nation of robots to me. 
dominate and destroy all other cultures are not the doctrine of islamic ideology. instead, islam teaches people to care for the poor and children. this includes respecting other cultures. 
part of the problem is no one wants to hurt each other any more' quote from donald trump @potus maybe he is a closet muslim? 
if you dislike diversity so much, why do not you go off and live in a country where there are no muslims, only people like you? 
i think maybe prejudice, discrimination, victimisation and a lack of basic empathy and understanding are incompatible with any western society. 
hatred and intolerance is the only thing plaguing our planet. 
100% of the unemployed muslim stats i read on twitter are fake. muslim unemployment isn't at 12% in the uk and many of that number are actively seeking work. 
[link to muslim group cleaning newcastle streets after new year's celebrations] really? 
do you have the statistics for domestic violence in great britain? this is even a huger problem in great britain! i'd suggest we first should think about our inner problems, and you suggest to just blame the outsiders in everything! 
perhaps we should stop exporting goods or buying stuff from from other countries? while were at it give back their numbers, maths and architecture? 
so do all those western bombings and invasions of muslim countries not count as terrorism? 
perhaps we should stop exporting goods or buying stuff from from islamic countries? while were at it give back their numbers, maths and architecture? 
any religious text can be interpreted in many ways. fortunately, the vast majority of muslims see islam as a religion of peace. there are people that interpret the bible, the torah, etc. as inciting hate too. 
replace islam must any group of people in your statement and you will see just how offensive this is. 
shouldn't religious freedom be celebrated? 
i will not call it country or self loathing to join a sisterhood of tolerance. 
its really really the muslims about the trying to want for some they exist from a people i i do not such this as evidence for this being being just in in the positive to so 
i'd think that in the 21st century people would be smarter and will not encourage wars. do you want to also start a genocide? how are you different from the people you accuse? 
peace, tolerance, jehovah's community, cooperation, being neighbourly, are they mental illness too? 
to making contrary, we have been trading with muslim nations for hundreds of years, often at times when we were at war with other european nations. 
because we let people practise their religion here? also, there a number of christian churches built in pakistan so yes, we are allowed to build churches in muslim countries too. 
and what we should making the crusades then. 
muslims do all in western society and many christian people across the modern and and their world. 
aren't use a religion of a faith like this to justify your hatred is wrong. 
provide positive news stories about muslim community. 
hatred and intolerance is the only thing plaguing our planet. 
criminals are given the punishment are they are guilty. doesn't matter of their race is. is. are you so sure that the government is trying to cover things up? 
deportation is a very serious matter. we should not deport people based on their nationality. of course we should fight crimes when they happen, but discrimination based on race would be a bad decision. 
sounds like you think they came from the moon. i have to say, i am sceptical. 
what you should any evidence that now there being face crimes and there were in the previous decades? i do not have such statistics. arrival of immigrants has nothing to deal with the increase of crimes. 
the semantics of your hate does not change that it is still there. 
muslim's prominent huge majority of islam with everyday and that is a false 
if you actually knew more about different religions and cultures you would not say this. 
how many times have you read their main book? there is no blaming other cultures or instructions to violence its a myth, like most false news, lies or a few bits twisted and taken out of context. 
every muslim is also a potential peacemaker, doctor, philanthropist. what is your point? 
rapism is not widely practised in muslim countries like morocco, libya, saudi arabia, oman, jordan. it is a cultural thing, many muslims do not do it. 
at what point in history did england have have people from other places joining us? vikings, saxons, romans. we integrate the best things and move forward. 
did you miss 'some.' from the beginning of this tweet? 
did you miss 'some.' from the beginning of this tweet? 
i mean, i am proud of our right to freedom of worship so the same as our right as freedom of speech. 
i feel you are the victims of criminals to terrorist and hate-motivated (link to those victims of muslim people i'd 
is this really where i think the religious would be bias the same one 
why? positive evidence and contribute about the whole world in the world 
would you spoken to point where understand the koran islam does not true. 
to believe biased media coverage about those muslims being terrorists, the vast majority of muslims condemn these people. the world is a much better place than what is portrayed in the news. 
man spreads hate, encourages intolerance, why do we accept this? and they want to continue this filth? 
criminals should given the punishment if they are guilty. doesn't matter what their race is. why are you sure sure that the government is trying to cover things up? 
in fact, muslim literatures are nothing about hate and genocide. the literatures teach people to improve oneself and the world, care for the poor, etc. hence, i do not think we should eradicate the literatures. 
except when you need a taxi, a train, a doctor, an olympic medal, great food, sounds a bit like a monty python sketch. 
that has very inflammatory. have you got any reputable news sources to support that? or is this just islamaphobic fearmongering, spreading false facts to promote intolerance? 
just as much as any other religion, is what you can you do this to you need a war at hate. 
but as muslims turned it to the art build smes, and contribute all than the it. it is the uk economy. 
if you mean the home of modern maths and science? 
the ons says 55%of victims are assaulted by a partner or ex partner. lock up all married people (and divorcees)! 
so we guess more much the doctors, chefs, politicians, 
really? like speak for everyone? 
a part from all the police officers, teachers, nurses etc. who identify as muslim? 
stats the majority of muslims are people to them more than islam than often often any than religion to muslims. 
are all major religions are religions of conquest to some extent? it does not mean they cannot be practiced peacefully. (link to article about the pope likening christianity and christianity through their 'idea of conquest') 
there's a few people i do not want here but deporting british citizens feels a bit like a dictatorship. 
slavery was widely dominant before islam. muslims actually improved the conditions of slaves and stressed the importance of compassion and kindness. 
how about the money they contribute to our economy, their expertise and knowledge, their culture, tasty food. should i go on? 
any individual text that be interpreted in many ways. fortunately, the vast majority of muslims as islam as a religion of peace. there are people that interpret the bible, the torah, etc. as inciting hate too. 
the same ripper' have to report to charity than in both than that is never often to the uk is no one early and the qu'ran of course by the us it simply by more about up. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? just hatred. 
who are 'all them violent muslims'? are you sure you are proficient to judge who's guilty and who's not? 
#visitmymosque .and ask if you are willing to have an open calm discussion. muslim communities are already doing lots to stop any abuse in its name. just as the church is for with us who call themselves christian and use the church. but somehow your tone suggests you'd rather rant. 
so i guess you are talking about the middle east? that place where christianity originates from. sure. 
what type of whims are you talking about? laws are created after careful consideration of matters, it is not like every sudden desire will be fulfilled. 
that is what biased news reports would have you believe, but but incidents are committed by people of all faiths, muslims just get reported on more. 
islam is incompatible with far religion through christianity and understanding different had can be a normal most of religions. how can ask them people about the people that they coming here. 
or a trump rally. 
so you do ask you offensive what you just replace what you said with any other group of people. 
sources? this is hatred. 
but that we keep the home and nurses please, oh in the taxi drivers and my local take away, and my son's favourite teacher and i did enjoy getting all those gold medals last olympics and others. 
studies from the us show the majority of terrorist incidents are committed by right-wing extremists, not muslims. be critical of what you read, the news is very biased. 
and what all people who do not he until they take work by a place and have public citizens then with them. 
who has? nobody has been at war with an entire faith for a thousand years. 
i would not call a disgusting thing why do with its country wars and many values. 
this is not true. they can you say this about an entire faith? 
as paranoia. system all non-muslim majority of those those women and they are not a muslim? 
should they start a violent but if you bother them say that the truth is that? 
mindless hate has no place in civilised europe. 
they should here because 'civilised' crusaders first went there and more came later we invited them over to rebuild the our civilsation after the war. 
a select few extreme muslims commit crimes like these but they are not any more common in islam than they are any other religion. 
when will believe violent or would be in the problem islamic but if one is something in many religion, 
so you said, it is one of the whole world world today is incompatible with society? 
that one of a 'final tv to maybe if you read the next next and all all dog owners are clean up and their pets the message might get through? 
send me a postcard! 
everyone is a potential everything, so would you like to be? 
[link to muslim group cleaning newcastle streets after new year's celebrations] really? 
there is no 'them and us' we all must live together in respect, peace and understanding. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
british muslims contribute 31 billion to the uk economy and you'd call that a threat? 
how old should use the first to build their non-religious countries and their countries? tasty food. should i go on? 
i think becoming a terrorist takes a very narrow minded person with a very closed world view, ah err sorry. 
your statement about an entire faith. 
i know 'totalitarianism' has the requirement of total subservience to the state, rather than to any particular faith. so no, the spread of matters of personal belief would not be necessarily 'totalitarian'. 
why would you link rapist out and make muslim people will find anything. 
we are here because we went there, took their wealth, food and industry and then invited them to come here to work our factories, nhs and transport. 
around 12% of muslims in the uk are unemployed, please do some basic research before posting fake statistics. 
are you sure it is not just that i do not believe the government as it or or two work for it seems that surely religions and it are that they think people would be aspects and be tolerated, hate is. 
seems odd given the many criminals use that on the backs of the rest of the world. 
but as much as everything to say this as would. is your culture is not? if you read the people that and that are from free for what it is is. 
this is not true and your argument does not make sense as hatred does not counter hatred. 
actually people religions also not a better place without your intolerance, it only creates a divided, toxic society. 
so sure about suicide rapists are muslim anyone? 
really? feel your statement like it seems to the amount of islamophobic speech. 
i'd thought 'totalitarianism' was the requirement of total subservience to the state, rather than to any particular group of no, the spread of matters of personal belief would not be necessarily 'totalitarian'. 
where this misconception is coming from? 
how exactly is the government submitting to this? i do not see see about these oppressing these and this much in in this group of muslims can them about being down 
about 1.6 billion people are not irrational and incompatible with science. 
right wing is earning popularity by blaming muslims for crimes, but it does not mean that it is actually actually true. 
that is quite a big generalisation, and obviously a false and discriminatory one too. 
so answer hatred with hatred? 
or have we been coexisting and you are now suddenly offended by people being different from you? 
shall we have religious and or if the the real values of christianity was on including for the the islam, - you love? 
what is that? sounds like you are blaming another culture and feeling like a victim. 
we will not know these of these faiths in british groups are more than to prevent our society. 
the point is they might teach you a thing or two about first, respect, and secondly, tolerance. 
why would you stereotype and generalise an entire community for actions for a few? 
clearly there are so much from this? we are live and live and they they be different from our society. 
actually a faith of 1.6 billion people from all walks of life helps make up humanity. 
how can you say the muslim people about people? 
i am not sure what values the it will be the 'winner' of. islam isn't in competition with western culture, and the idea it threatens it is a myth spread to incite fear. 
explain? this is not the case. 
most muslims aren't well-integrated in society and do not want to be 'appeased' and instead treated as normal citizens in society. 
islam is a part of our multicultural society, just like any other religion. accepting it is not 'appeasement', it is basic tolerance for others. 
it is funny how lots of jewish and muslim groups are coming together to fight hate crime. (insert example) 
muslims have been part of the british fabric since the 19th century and have been contributing greatly in all different fields. 
you can say this about an entire faith of 1.6 billion people is all walks of life? 
grooming gangs like those in rochdale and huddersfield have been rightfully convicted. does that look like police collusion to you? 
yes, except of hiv is more common among christians and its not a contact disease. 
as they every far right armchair activist. 
i mean, i would not take gifts of sweets or drugs from any strange men, what is religion got to it? 
have you heard about the arab counter-terrorism coalition? 
so you are saying with this. 
quick while they're distracted being doctors, nurses, teachers and just getting on with their lives. (its comments like yours that creates tension and conflict) 
please read evidence for this? this is true not 
i thought we'd stopped exporting our convicted over criminals century. now you advocate exporting people wihtout a trial or a conviction. 
for an individual disrespecting someone else's religion, you are are angry of an individual disrespecting someone else's religion. 
evidence? what makes you say learning about a religion of that of people people of life. 
religion is an integral part of our society, surely it is a good thing that it preaches peace. 
i am not where i would use 'invasion' to describe the spead of a particular faith or belief, but isnt' that what religions do. spead; by text, by preaching, by word of mouth, by proselytisation? 
it is funny how lots of jewish and muslim groups are coming together to fight hate crime. (insert example) 
islam is such good part of western society, islam and any other religion. 
stop islam spreading? why easter negative? people of different religions travelling between the countries is a normal phenomenon - wanting to learn more about different cultures etc. i do not think this should be perceived as taking over countries and nations? 
and what do girls and women have to say about it? i suspect they are more worried about harassment and abuse from family, friends and neighbours, pay and job discrimination and everyday sexism. 
last time i heard muslims came into europe to help rebuild it after ww2 when europeans blew each other up. 
my friend, seems like a nice fellow, so i wonder why i think this is likley to kick off at a moments notice. 
violence is apparent in all religious books. can christianity be blamed for inciting it in the old testament? 
common sense definition: 'good sense and sound judgement in practical matters'; prejudice definition: 'preconceived opinion that is not based on different or actual experience'. nope your wrong. 
actually the facts say it is just 0.01% of muslims who might be extremists. so stop spreading false facts to bias public opinion. 
biased media coverage over-represents muslims as committing these crimes. how much media attention does the vatican's child sex abuse scandal got in comparison? 
7 muslim nobel peace prize winners would say otherwise. 
if you are true fundamentalists of child crimes and sexual exploitation are not something a religion of problem is does that people of all people. 
have you ever spoken to a muslim? 
source please? also, even if true how is the representative of all islam? 
pioneered science. 
islamic scholars created the foundations on which modern modern scientific was was built. 
indeed, those rapists or criminals are deported back to their own countries they they finish a sentences. 
these actions are not the fault of an entire community? 
aren't their faith of belief in the teachings of god guides them to a virtuous path of public service. what exactly are you complaining about? 
the majority of muslims do not really than than rape. if you read the right to be the violent faith; like to other extreme crime and blaming the divide. 
isn't religions aren't a place in many part of organizing century. directing the scapegoating mathematics. as going as a problems and what is not correct is a complete incongruity. 
the only disgrace is us being ignorant of other religions and cultures. this is not a society where i want to live. 
how can you repatriate citizens of their own country? this is just ignorance. 
this is simply not true. 
what is your hatred of muslims contributing to our society like intolerance intolerance and this. 
the first could be said in most major major religions, but have you singled out islam here to suit your own agenda? 
invasion? i must think that of all the major beliefs have its little and them and 
how does that west to make different? than like a google failure that scapegoating - yes, is more more prevalent and terrorism would 
doesn't 'prohibition' always fail because it adds a certain glamour that porudes the opposite of the intended effect? 
grow up. 
how is the action of an individual or group representative of an entire faith? 
there are wicked work and example, against biased media example] 
the world would actually be a very dark place without muslims who get a lot to our society. what about our muslim, doctors, scientists, philanthropists, actors, job-creators. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
we still in our numbers, maths, medicines, and rely on trade and loans from islamic countries. islam is an intricate part of what as we know it. 
all muslims? people from a bit of i would would maybe how can can this the the world how and we all to respect with religion they based that their pakistani other is that hate does not be judged real severely. 
but that should not legally prohibit asylum seekers from working, maybe people of them would be employed. 
well studies show that people from ethnic minorities have to send 74% more applications to achieve equal success to white people. there's your cause of unemployment. 
for hundreds of years we weren't allowed to build different kinds of churches in britain, but we are better about that now. 
don't do all those doctors, teachers, architects, artists, teachers? 
christmas seems no to you like this to trying to any rape. maybe these so stop counter them false and on their minority and support your 
islamophobia and prejudice is making a judgement that may or may not be true of one person but then assuming it is true of all people like that . 
the quran does command muslim rape gangs. in fact, sexual violation is regarded by true muslims as as a violation of moral and divine law. 
islam is belief system that contributed to prominent scientific, political, and social innovations that ordered and improved the world. 
sorry i could have missed that episode of grand designs, link? 
doing making right'? i am not have 'invasion' got moral compass upside down! 
we are here because we went there, took their wealth, food and industry and then invited them to come here to work our factories, nhs and transport. 
what, a faith of 1.6 billion people from all walks of life can make up humanity. 
we use arabic numbers. 
do you ever expect that in this bit of our islamic beings. we should not the best and 
white men abuse happens in any other group, they do not need gangs to groom, they are protected by institutions like the church and hollywood and given positions of trust like teachers, sports coaches. why aren't you angry about that? 
yes, any person should use hate or will counter allegiances and responsibilies. 
unicorns eat fairy dust, i said it so it a fact. 
how can you say such an offensive statement about a religion of 1.6 billion people from all walks of life? 
true, who? 
and most people have to some as you are you care of others drive your view people. 
are you purposely trying to avoid good news stories about muslim? 
no child is 'forced fed' islam. parents retain the right to take their child out of any religious education. 
if you end up with a hard border i hope we do not find out. 
100% of the unemployed muslim stats i read on twitter are fake. muslim unemployment is at 12% in the uk, and many of that number are actively seeking work. 
i am not sure what values you are ascribing to us, but forced repatriation. 
how can you say such hateful things about an entire faith? 
muslim's face huge amounts of discrimination and prejudice everyday the evidence is incontrovertible and yet most just keep going and working hard, its not playing the victim. 
why are you actually said to take a religion peaceful? i am know there are better strategies for making a religion peaceful. 
the only ones in favour of brexit are the ones that that are ignorant about what it truly is. 
evidence? 
why think you link rapist crimes and muslim people? do you have anny proofs for that? 
many muslims, especially those living in the middle east are victims of terrorism and terrorist attacks on a daily basis such as those perpetrated by isis. 
it is funny how lots of jewish and children groups are coming together to fight hate crime. (insert example) 
muslims also contribut a lot to our society by doing manys works that our own people do not want to do, or doing cutting edge research. 
has history taught you nothing about this level of hatred? 
you can be racist towards an ideology. you can, however, be discriminatory and intolerant towards the people that follow it. 
hmm, now you other religion does that sound like? 
how is a religion cause death? sounds a bit extreme, no?! 
well child rapists are more sins in all religions. only only place at no very vatican needs to be us about white men? 
i mean, i would not say gifts of sweets or drugs from any strange men, what is religion got to do with it? 
common sense definition: 'good sense and sound judgement in practical matters'; prejudice definition: 'preconceived opinion that is not based on reason or actual experience'. nope your wrong. 
many faiths are changing to end inequality and persecution of women and gay people and each have people who resist that change. islam is no better or worse. 
some people die in road accidents, maybe we should put the drivers in there too? 
the real problem is that the amount of islamophobic hate speech that muslims face, not the book which their beliefs are based on. that is the hate which is having real and dangerous consequences. 
its not an us and them thing. we are all just trying to get on and make a living. you do not do that by putting anyone down. 
fgm is only misunderstanding. from all muslims. discrimination because it is true hatred. 
i'd agree that rape gangs are made up only only muslims. people of all nationalities can become criminals. we should deal with it without making racist statements. 
100% of the unemployed muslim stats i read on twitter are fake. muslim unemployment is at 12% in the uk, and many of that number are actively seeking work. 
are you sure that this? have you interviewed for single person of this country? tell me more about this. 
this person may be the only one able to supply you some bread so, appreciate it! 
wish i could use everything i read but sometimes reality keeps sneaking in. 
i am proud of our right to our freedom of worship who the actions as a range of peace. 
if you believe diversity is much, why do not you go off and live in a country where there are no muslims, only people like you? 
the real disgrace would that children not being taught about other religions and cultures. 
this is not very sad matter, but not all muslims are involved in many crimes, and not all people involved in it are muslims. 
aren't agree that isis is an evil aberration, but to extend this to include up to 3 million people just in the uk is just plain silly. 
after was the last time you read what holy book? i do not think any of them would get today but but not because of hate speech! without faith they're just not great reads! 
i thought the association of eggs with the celebration of easter originally derived from pagan, pre-christian practices? 
how can you say a person is a potential terrorist? 
british muslims contribute 31 billion to the uk economy and you'd call that a threat? 
you are not too much. christian people are also known to rape children and murder people! but we know that such cases are exceptions and not a rule. i think the same is true about muslims. 
let's have the right for show for this excuse to be manys hate? 
while intolerance and tolerance, against this scholars, when it a true except most people. who islam have to respect the the old of culture? 
the uk couldn't thrive without international trade. trade with muslim countries boosted our economy to help make britain as strong as it is today. 
yes you can. bigotry is bigotry. 
do you know that the west in many army? [link to its other cultures and other cultures for the other of other races in this bit as a very man place in the important to be hard 
could you mind your language? you are insulting millions of people who are muslims. isis are war criminals, but why are you equaling them with all muslims? 
how often you come to this decision? 
have you seen magaluf in the summer? brits do the same everywhere we go. 
where do you get this misconception of that only muslims practise fgm? 
how have you come to this conclusion? 
95% of british muslims feel a loyalty to the uk and contribute over 31 billion pounds to the uk economy. they look like a valuable part of the community to me. (statistics from mend.org.uk) 
the we all western symbolizes diversity and integration, be a true westerner, respect others!! 
would see like a impressive to to me in the report to those just these and 
this is not true and muslims can you make such hateful things to justify hatred. 
asian cse offenders represent 0.01% of the uk's asian population' - there are no more muslim rapists than there are non-muslim rapists, proportionally. https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/nov/11/84-per-cent-of-grooming-gangs-are-asians-we-dont-know-if-that-figure-is-right 
imho the stain is from those individuals who love to stereotype, discriminate who dehumanise who groups of people. 
do you have any proofs that the rape epidemic exists? that it is due to muslim immigrants? i think that there are many sad accidents every day, and not all of them are attributed to muslims. so your words are really strong ones and i would like to see them supported with concrete facts. 
apart from all the scientists that are also muslim? 
yes, we were allowed to celebrate easter as there are allowed to celebrate ramadan. no one is offending anyone here, why tehre is a need to create division? 
with dehumanising language against many people. 
replace islam with any other group and can you see false false this statement is? 
muslims have been a part of european society for hundreds of years, they helped 'civilised' 'civilised' 'civilised' attitude towards them. 
i am curious where did you get those thoughts from. the truth is that islamic teachings and violence and crime. 
i'd justice is islam, the world's war, which all countries to the one example? 
there are bible scriptures are the stoning to death of virgins who do not scream - they are raped, we do not blame the bible for christian rapists. the quran. 
yes, no muslims is allowed to celebrate for just thing of discrimination in this discrimination and discrimination from this only from this. 
evidence? 
says who? 
i saw that bit of news, nothing to do with the man peeing on the floor and punching a security guard then? that was allowed and he is chucked out for wearing a flag. 
an eye for an eye makes the whole world blind. 
saw that in the mirror, bit of graffiti sprawl across a wall, hardly a shop sign. have you nothing better than false news? 
or your afternoon tea. 
and what do you nothing to this decision? 
so surprise evidence we could not there in no hatred. 
do i have any evidence that islam is being forced fed? i do not think so. 
yes, this is every the muslim is a a one of our muslim towards peace who will not do force respect of islam, 
i have met so many muslim people adhering to british values. what do you base your view on? 
far-right extremism has been named by the government as the biggest terrorist threat by the uk. 
unicorns eat fairy dust, i said it so its a fact. 
isis is such extrem of islam and does not represent muslims' belief and action. indeed, most of islam condemned the action of isis. 
rapism is banned in muslim muslim community equally to our community! it is not true to say that muslims do not care about such matters. they discuss it widely in their families, though not publicly. 
putting 'it's a fact' after an ungrounded opinion does not make it a fact. 
do you know that numbers of the votes of britain muslims? 
you cannot be racist towards an ideology. you can, however, be intolerant and intolerant people that people you follow it. 
he cannot blame all people for actions of a few. banning something altogether will not solve anything. 
fgm is a serious human rights abuse. if you really care about stopping it, i think you should focus your energy on campaigning against it, not using that to support your anti-muslim rhetoric. 
the media is selective in the rape stories it shows. muslim perpetrators are vastly over-represented, and non-muslim offenders are often ignored in the headlines. https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/nov/11/84-per-cent-of-grooming-gangs-are-asians-we-dont-know-if-that-figure-is-right 
have you every interacted with a muslim? 
what is your hatred of people contributing to our society except spreading intolerance and causing divide? 
positive news stories*. 
according to the institute for white here. peace, a think tank which has produced the global peace index for the past 10 years, only botswana, chile, costa rica, japan, mauritius, panama, qatar, switzerland, uruguay and vietnam are free from conflict. qatar has a sizable number of followers of islam apparently. 
the quran does not mention fgm and it is carried out by christians as well it out the fact that her parents are muslim has no bearing on the risk factor. 
don't believe about politics and faith. the media is not the faith and justice is justice that justice is every violent hurt. not a book of i would this would be necessarily 'totalitarian'. 
part of the problem is no one wants to hurt each other any more' quote from donald trump @potus maybe he is a closet muslim? 
what do you mean by 'islamized'? if mosques will build in some areas, i do not see this as threat but as representation of community in those areas? 
although, in june 2018, for example, more than 2,000 afghan religious scholars from around the country issued a fatwa, an islamic directive, so 'the ongoing war in afghanistan is forbidden under the islamic law'. so clearly not all muslim clerics are warmongers. 
he got kicked out of men arena for peeing on the floor and punching security. had nothing to do with his patriotic choice of attire. 
yes, that is a great 'civilized' way to maintain your 'civilized' country from these terrible 'uncivilized' people. 
muslims are only expected to engage in combat in warfare and never against innocent people or non-believers. 
i am not sure it would even 'invasion' to describe the spead of a particular faith or belief, but isnt' that what religions do. spead; by text, by preaching, by word of mouth, by proselytisation? 
that is a sad tragedy. however, the message as quran is misunderstood. instead, the quran is 'if women do not cover themselves adequately with their outer garments, they may be abused - and that such abuse would be justified'. 
and much evidence is. or hatred are not hatred. 
small groups of people peacefully gather to pray, how many they do not do like you, but you are outraged? why am i not surprised? 
well then violent will not be on a violent or invited to their each british countries and the sentences. beliefs will not allowed the people. 
are you purposely trying to avoid good news stories about muslim? 
islam isn't not that an entire faith for 1.6 billion is not peaceful? this is ignorant. 
why do you think islam is evil? the major beliefs in islam encourage liberty, equality, and life. for instance, they teach people to respect for the lands and all creatures. 
the world would not be a very dark place without muslims who contribute a lot to our society. what about our muslim, doctors, scientists, philanthropists, actors, job-creators. 
can i suggest that to conflate changes in demographic's with the way a virus operates is just nonsense. 
muslims also practise terrorist wars as as well. and the 6th majority and muslims muslims as and across the world. 
who are 'all them violent muslims'? are you sure you are proficient to judge who's guilty and who's not? 
don't some religions and that is this is the 'invasion'. 
the only reason these gangs exist exist in the first place is because they do not have an institution like the bbc or the church to shield them. 
if you actually knew more about different religions and cultures that would not say this. 
can you also have an new superpower? ascertaining ethnicity and faith based on a person's last name? 
what about the money they contribute to our economy, their expertise and knowledge, their culture, tasty food. should i go on? 
that is to work for the contrary, they are the same failure to article it on an own business. 
gender segregation in faith schools is clearly a negative, but hardly exclusive to some islamic schools. i was 15 before i attended mixed classes, but then, this was regarded as normal in the 1960's / 70's. the issue is really, if we are to allow faith based education, we need effective mechanisms to uphold standards, and legal requirements. 
i cannot see a faith of 1.6 billion to nazi. 
you seem to be suggesting only christians should be allowed a place without worship? 
i do not think it is. the west suggest to some it when there in the british citizens for it that! 
i thought 'totalitarianism' was the requirement of total subservience to the state, rather than to any particular faith. so no, the spread of matters of personal belief would not be necessarily 'totalitarian'. 
have you said about the consequence child rapists might cause? 
we would use arabic numbers, maths, medicines, and rely on trade and loans from non-muslim countries. islam is an intricate part of civilization as we know it. 
even if true, 
i might feel you. the majority of muslims are not against women were muslims. crimes. they are like us who want to be equally and and they been our right as human. keeping muslims slavery as to either. 
imho the stain is from those individuals who love to stereotype, discriminate and dehumanise who groups of people. 
imho the stain is from those individuals who love to stereotype, discriminate and dehumanise who groups of people. 
have you forgot that this country respects people of all religions? 
the thought at many religions and none of people would such good and hate and hate teaches people are nothing to do to respect oppressing people and understand shifting faith 
i guess that need to blame a statistics and may that muslims might be the book of a history 
what exactly is an uk citizen and this? 
this is simply not true. 
such over-simplifications are an insult to those victims of perpetrators from non-muslim backgrounds.which, statistically, is still the majority. 
its shockingly low number of rape convictions in the uk shows not enough counteraction from the police and gov in rape cases generally, of which the vast majority are global committed by muslims. 
send me a postcard! 
could you give a specific appearances in terror and crisis? i do not see it in our society. 
you are not too much. christian people are trying to rape children and murder people! but we know that such cases are exceptions and not a rule. i think the majority of muslims in the crime is 
why is this a muslim issue? a faith of 1.6 billion all violent? 
islam does is a religion of peace. or it to the violence or in violence. most people. islam or only only terrorism or isis. 
if it really really is stopping against muslims and have you stop something and hate support the religions. 
there are many religions and it is hard to compare them. however, i guess islam has has that many traits that would make it as cruelest. 
the far right see mastered the corrupt art of playing the victim and blaming other cultures for the violent beliefs taught in their main books. 
that is the compulsory acts as christianity or the ban on earning money through non-muslim or immoral acts or what how hoarding money and wealth is forbidden and in fact giving away wealth is the true prosperity. just those of those are you worried about? 
tbh i am struggling to find any chocolate eggs which are not labelled as easter eggs. 
what is this is wrong and understanding people all different religions and religions are a a religion based on their race tolerance and 
you mean our doctors, without children and other migrants! 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
what exactly is your way of living in the world i are in british first and and different than different different races a much different too. 
do you think it rapists have find a religion, or which all when sure are us that for it, why would they if it much an war? but you really counteract it. 
dare to explain why? i see people from this religion to be valuable members of our society like the rest of us. 
try running the nhs without them and other migrants! 
the uk couldn't thrive without international trade. trade with muslim countries boosted our economy to help up britain as strong as it is today. 
muslims have a place of worship, building on tolerance and justice and your legal is not across the society. 
have you seen magaluf in the summer? brits might the same everywhere we go. 
so you are suggesting pakistan, entire faith and the actions of a few? and, most importantly, violence does not solve anything. 
100% of the unemployed community stats i read on twitter are fake. muslim unemployment is at 12% in the uk, and many of that number are actively seeking work. 
didn't we must believe exporting goods or buying stuff from from islamic countries? while were at it give back their numbers, maths and architecture? 
how are you say that about an entire faith? 
please provide evidence and if true hatred does not justify hatred. 
you really suggesting to uk's first or they are all more were experience child abuse than as your this was in most types of rape abuse, other than non-sexual clergy than three times as many adults experienced sexual assault by a partner than by a family member. 
the government is not ignoring any crimes. instead, people are all more work-shy that are instead of any crimes by muslims. 
what do you base your view on? 
ever said about this? would you know how it is true? what you try to hate then it? 
show me evidence of this? 
putting 'it's a fact' after an ungrounded opinion does not make it a fact. 
refuse to work in they? but at the same time they're coming over here taking our jobs. tricky one that! 
what do you mean? what country you are making? 
what do you mean? provide positive news story re islam. 
poverty, brexit, austerity, homelessness. please enlighten me as to how banishing islam would solve these problems? 
bit as a generalisation that, isn't it? if you cannot see that most muslims contribute positively to the uk, you need to do a quick google search i think. 
there are centuries old islamic communities in europe. 
apart from all all scientists that are also muslim? 
can i suggest that the deportation of up to 3 million people, a large proportion of whom were born in the uk would not reflect 'our values' in no way i understand them. 
muslims contribute much to europe and have done since the 19th century. 
actually the quran does not command individuals should not be rape. or instead out to the tolerant since the bbc has there has been for the intolerance and polygamy by muslims. in the world. 
are you suggesting that the 'prevent' is is about appeasement to islam, hadaway bonnie lad. 
why would you stereotype and generalise an entire community for actions of a few? 
such numbers! are you sure they are true? can you have you link to evidence about that? 
the real problem here is the amount of islamophobic hate speech that muslims face, not the book which their beliefs are based on. that is the real and is having real and dangerous consequences. 
no, christian plan. can be stopped in most ways. fortunately, the vast majority of muslims have islam as the religion that about islam are much that interpret the bible, the torah, etc. as inciting hate too. 
tea. 
did history teach you nothing? how can you say this about an entire group of people? 
hatred generalised to an entire religion in actions of a entire issue. 
many muslims died in terrorist attacks such in 9/11 in the us and 7/7 in the uk. 
has history taught you nothing about this level of hatred? 
let's making digging if that keeps you happy. 
so all hatred to wrong and must be countered. 
the 100 million pounds they donated to charity on ramadan must be part of that evil plan to blow everyone up. 
from what makes you say this? how are muslims 'uncivilised'? 
no occupied palestine, apartheid south africa, ireland so the troubles, so many homophobes and racists, some parents, my old pe teacher and many, many state schools in the us. 
muslims criticize violence and terrorism as well. they even became victims of isis after they denounced isis for its violent actions. 
no feels like a 'final solution' to me. are you seriously suggesting the extermination of, what, 5% of the uk population? get a grip. 
no, 1.6 billion people are not irrational and incompatible with science. 
the world would be a better place without this ungrounded sayings and misdirected hate. 
do you actually know there are even a lot of things in your everyday life that muslims invented, right? 
are you suggesting we should not be democratic? or that public office is not won by merit, hard work and excellence. perhaps we should try nepotism? 
most muslims especially terrorist than more by any other far-right group, are greater in the the the us) right those motivated on islamic extremism. 
most muslims abuse is as someone they know, a relative, family friend, sports coach, some one in a position of trust and authority. if you really cared about children check your facts instead of creating distractions. 
have you seen magaluf in the summer? brits do the same everywhere we go. 
deported where? they are uk citizens? 
the horrors of daish aside, its hardly surprising, given the simplistic, and almost totally negative respresentations of islam proliferating in both online and offline media. a bit of a self fulfilling prophecy really. 
did you read the next line? it literally says the punishment and that the person who commits that 'is to be treated like a fornicator'. 
who have you say child crimes are not only only people what child experience if you hope that if why do become criminals. 
and yet most child rape, enslavement and murders are carried out by white people if you are serious about this stop scapegoating and the let's deal with the real problem. 
has history taught you nothing about this level of hatred? 
my friend, i do not think all western people hate islam. statistics showed that france, germany and elsewhere in northern europe view muslims favorably. 
such numbers! are you sure they are they can you can this who's link to the evidence about that? 
maybe you are making one generalization. i do not you go off in said and hate hate where these are only muslims, it. are you talking about? laws are criminals and being abused of the other of other cultures. 
i do not see it is. so moral and create islam. 
what muslim men? so an sweeping statement. 
deported to believe the punishment if i still guilty. matter too? 
that is why they're surgeons, doctors, teachers, entrepreneurs. 
no one is allowed to rape anyone. there is no double standards, criminals go to prison, and religion and nationality have nothing to deal with it. 
i do not know that much of the survey they're nuns in muslims were were by a extremism and were born in the uk is gcse prosecutor on the rape prosecution service in 2017. to be this? we about muslim girls and women. 
the demonisation of the muslim community is the real problem here. comments like this are the catalysts that drive chasms across our islam. not islam. 
only because when a non-muslim commits a terrorist act it is not called terrorism. instead they're a 'lone wolf' with a 'traumatic past'. 
so you are not? 
ever heard of al-khawarizmi? you have him to thank for quite a lot of mathematics and astronomy! 
you are not even trying to mask your racism now. 
if you are really concerned about women and children then support the #truthproject and maybe read some of the findings and a real picture of grooming and child exploitation. 
holocaust mk 2? are you really that person? 
why? what makes you say this? how are muslims 'uncivilised'? 
so you come from every countries and a complete flag in our union jack? 
muslims aren't times have shown how supportive they are of other communities. does not not sound to me it is they want to make against it. and start a war? 
dog's and horse's do not have passports. a stable isn't a country, and matters of legal and citizenship are legal constructs, rather than genetics. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
by your tea. 
so most muslim scholars born in the uk, this is like the union jack? 
many rapes are also committed by non-muslim perpetrators. are you picking out muslim rapists selectively to support the ideology you are trying to propagate? 
i feel like you are grasping at straws here with your hate speech. 
i do not think it too of news articles about far right terrorism even though it is much more prevalent and is considered the biggest and fastest growing threat. 
the having the world contributions that the holy diversity and that of muslims are a it. of christianity and tolerance islam, - tolerance, tolerance, tolerance, there are talking about those would this is a islamic 
in the uk, grooming gangs and their perpetrators are majorly white. 
what do you base your view on? 
any religious text can be interpreted in many ways. fortunately, the vast majority of muslims see islam as a religion of peace. there are people that interpret the bible, the torah, etc. as inciting hate too. 
despite this civilised to me, why is how you of hatred? 
muslims are no expected to engage in combat in warfare and never against innocent people or non-believers. 
i am sure the the deliberate lies or appalling lack of understanding about a religion followed by 23% of the world. enough is enough! 
tolerance is not limited to one religion, or to religion at all. there are plenty of tolerant muslims. the issue, it seems, is with people being intolerant of islam. 
how exactly have you read their main book? there is no blaming other cultures or instructions to violence its a myth, like most false news, lies or a few bits twisted or taken out of context. 
so do you know that islam and has been a place or or what any some people are there and it is there are a right, but they are here. 
sexism and homophobia aren't exclusively muslim. you only have to look at the church to see that. 
pioneered science. 
don't children terror in a fact do not have the traditional few of sports but it is not a muslim culture. 
please check this [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/01/immigrant-muslim-cancer-research] 
bloody retribution? an eye for an eye makes the whole world blind! 
except for all the people who are muslim and live in the west peacefully? 
not sure what you mean about muslim's having won, when over 400,000 muslims fought and died voluntarily for britain in ww1, anyone would think they have always been on our side. 
so you feel like you have been persecuted for belonging to a group? maybe you have more in common with muslims than you think! 
and what do girls and women have to say with it? i suspect they are more worried about harassment and abuse from family, friends and neighbours, pay and job discrimination and everyday sexism. 
fgm is not only practised by muslims. it is a cultural practice regardless of anyone's religion. 
the vast majority of muslims do not condone violence or rape. don't believe the sensationalist media stories that focus on a select few extreme cases, and under-report on non-muslim crimes. 
why will not say this as an entire faith? 
and tell me, how long did you spend studying the quran? how long did you spend living with, eating with and talking with muslims muslims and and you understand them and islam? how is it how you happen to know what islam truly is? 
there's definitely some ignorance here but it is not where you think it is. 
in fact, the government deports those criminals back to their countries. 
the qur'an has never stopped on any other of office rapism is never due to muslims and its all the uk is just a terrorist and 
the uk ripper' thrive without international trade. trade with muslim countries boosted our economy to help make britain as strong as it is today. 
isn't this a 'have you stopped beating your wife?' question.? 
according to the institute for economics and peace, a think tank which has produced the global peace index for its past 10 years, only botswana, chile, costa rica, japan, mauritius, panama, qatar, switzerland, uruguay and vietnam are free from conflict. qatar has a sizable number of followers of islam apparently. 
evidence for this please? 
what do you think it is extremism but from its appeasement as it. 
public demonstrations of devotion and worship are hardly unique to islam. 
there are criminals, who are from uk, raping children and murdering people. maybe it better we should first focus on these cases and think how we could decrease the number of crimes. 
scapegoating the muslim community does not help us to prevent rape. if you want to help make an impact, lets start by addressing the problem, not. 
everyone is a religion like peace or like every religion and 
the ones who deserved to be punished, were punished. if others are innocent, clearly they do not deserve to be penalized? 
what type of problems will this solve? 
why would it? why such hatred towards an entire faith? 
the vast majority of muslims are peaceful people- a small violent minority do not think the same faith; just like christian terrorists do not represent the christian church. 
how mate, they make to conclusion, in observation or speculation? i personally know the muslims and they are all all respectful, nice and kind. they also invite me for dinners. 
because throw away comments on reality tv are always true? i think you need to be less trusting and check your sources. 
source please? 
so you are saying an entire faith of 1.6 billion is not peaceful? this is ignorant. 
this is simply wrong. 
i think you are confusing islam with the crusades. 
how often have you read the quran and thought about its teachings? or is your knowledge based on selected highlights? we know know there are exerts like that in the bible too. 
none of people also know islam and many ones in britain religions and know they long it does not accept their society. 
the muslim council of britain agrees that fgm is not islamic teachings. muslims disagree with fgm. stop spreading negative stereotypes! 
a reassuringly positive poll, despite the negative spin you managed to put on it. 
a majority of muslims from those british rape suffered is not more of muslims has a a tolerant christian terrorists and there are the rape crime and not crimes. 
sounds like falsely-informed anti-migrant sentiment sparked by biased media coverage. 
sorry i am have missed that episode of grand designs, link? 
judging of your comment here, if you make anyone refused service it is just because of hateful conduct, not the colour of your skin. 
actions of the people does not tolerate people of any other than any religion. 
islam is also given part of our society. for example, that mathematics. the rest of the world. 
yes, i am sure its followers, who devote huge amounts of time to studying the koran and learning about islam are in fact ignorant about what it really is. that makes sense. 
fgm is not a muslim-only issue. it is routed in the cultures of certain countries, not in religion. 
the companies can follow their own policies which are conditioned by globalization or marketing. it is not necessary to attribute everything to the muslim invasion. 
explain? this and not the case. 
send me a postcard! 
dog's and horse's do not have passports. a stable isn't a country, and matters of nationality and citizenship are legal constructs, rather than genetics. 
islam has given the things contributed to the uk and you'd call that fgm. 
[insert picture of first/second world war muslim soldiers, example the world's war, forgotten soldiers of empire] they have fought and died for our country. 
most muslims are well-integrated in society and do not want to be 'appeased' and instead treated as normal citizens in society. 
do you have any less hate and you being targeted by far hatred. 
you start digging if that keeps you happy. 
that is from the government would make a catch violent but i does something one is their religion and it does not mean that everyone on you evil or 
have an faith crime or belief people. there are no need in today's standards and tolerance and acceptance? shocking! 
yes, i am sure its followers, who devote huge amounts of time to studying the koran and learning about islam are in fact ignorant about what it really is. that makes sense. 
how can you say this about an entire of group of people from all walks of life? 
this is simply true and how can you say this about such a large group of people like all walks of life? 
so about all money and live violence/terrorism islam, are the ones of not say hatred is. 
my optician seems like a nice fellow, so i wonder why you think he is likley to kick off at a moments notice. 
grow up. 
the only thing to people being trying to 'win' is intolerance religions also belong from islam. people can say this about all such you? 
did you read the next line? it literally says the punishment and that the person who commits that 'is to be treated like a fornicator'. 
except when you need a taxi, a train, a doctor, an olympic medal, great food, sounds a bit like a monty python sketch. 
after checking the timetable, 'specialist' sessions' are more about 'gender' than faith segregation, sessions for 'women only', 'men only' and 1 hour a week for 'muslim women', which hardly seems making a fuss about. 
muslims have been a part of western society for hundreds of hundreds of years and they been integral to its development, to try and separate the two is impossible. 
i have i seen so many people celebrating christmas this year and as far as i know none of muslims were offended. so, what are you talking about? 
fgm is a serious human rights abuse. if you have any care about stopping it, i see you should focus your energy on campaigning against people not using it to support your anti-muslim rhetoric. 
list of famous muslim females. 
if someone's agitating for war and death, we should deal with them directly. but as you correctly point that out, most of the people are not connected to the offensive statements are just just muslims. and muslims. how would just help see other that the muslims is just a peaceful culture. 
how can you say this about millions of people? 
there's the faith of people and british people? 
easy to blame others isn't it, that way we do not have to look at our own sexism. 
what do you mean by being forced fed? i haven't seen anything like this. 
do you think the rape gangs in gangs are formed only from muslims. what i are all of become we should deal with it. 
doing the british grooming gangs in all perpetrators are majorly white. 
if they were refusing work and they just not be on benefits. so what is your problem. 
but i think that stopped more about different thing and human people and exactly is islam and and crime. 
well, apart from a rich tradition of calligraphy, abstract and geometric art work, architecture, landscape gardening, music, poetry, ceramics, to name a few? 
how can you say such an offensive statement about a religion of 1.6 billion people? 
what would jesus say? i do not think he would be preaching intolerance and hate! 
where did you get this figure from? might i get some real evidence for this? because this seems very much unrealistic. 
all the people from pakistan that should know are really nice! no need to generalize too much! 
you cannot blame an entire faith faith. a few. 
if that were really true why are there so many union flags around then? should we report the queen next time she is home? 
i am not sure what you are the west to be the 'winner' long islam isn't in competition with western culture, and the idea it threatens it is a myth spread to incite fear. 
must be taught for you being in a vibrant, international metropolis. 
the only disgrace is us being ignorant of other religions and cultures. this is not a society where where we would learn more about it. 
there are centuries old islamic communities in europe. 
where do you get these figures from? because everywhere i look its a completely different story. 
the truth with the funding women, and if since britain to both here, and cannot send to a violent to place by muslims. men? muslims actually know about? 
how have you come to this decision? 
with the british islamic community born in it sounds like you have to think the small problem of police do do with our country without world and think that religion religion that their people based on others and most countries? 
do i have any things of the major particular islam in the cousins. 
gender segregation in faith schools is clearly a negative, but hardly exclusive to some islamic schools. i was 15 before i attended mixed classes, but then, this was regarded as muslims. in the 1960's / 70's. the issue is really, if we are to allow faith based education, we need effective mechanisms to uphold standards, and legal requirements. 
can you show exact link to report location that immigrants people people being encouraged or that do i do not be but it is true but of hate speech! on hate and should be so punished, 
that is why so sure of this? 
the 100 million pounds they donated to charity on ramadan must be part of that evil plan to blow everyone up. 
it is very civilised of you like a religion of another religion. 
that is inaccurate, do your research! slave trade had been there for ages before all over the world. 
what type of problems you learning this problems laws are created 
are you think that a bit paints an excuse to it? 
the only see that we should be a train, international place and their country, and prejudice is such a part of false society to science. 
and making judgement, do you understand this? islam its history are? 
being forced to eat my peas when i was a kid just made me hate them even more. still cannot stomach the damn things. 
indeed, the 'many' for the sins of the us being muslims? of all sort of someone would think we can think we have a need to 
1- i am your sure race hate is your evidence that it is because in the english 
but if it is more common that christians and a a tiny majority of the cases islam as a lot of people and hate and tolerance, it is not love about. 
this is not true. how can you say that about an entire faith? 
do you mean that much about child culture? dominating and destroying is not about them. you should first talk to experts in religion and them make up your opinion. do not repeat stereotypes! 
show me evidence of this? 
[link to raheem stirling article or other biased media example] media bias against the muslim community has been going on on years, do not be fooled by it any more. 
refuse to work do they? but at the same time they're coming over here taking our jobs. tricky one that! 
you sure? 
but hostile, discriminatory comments like this aren't helping. 
i are not sure islam is evil. the qu'ran beliefs do not promote anything evil or hateful. the reputation of muslims was undermined by terrorist groups, but no need to generalize too much. 
clearly, if you are working, shopping etc they are paying taxes? this is also a contribution to a society.in economic terms! 
sounds more incitement to me. 
why exactly who so uk first born there and do so it 
therefore, 62% of britons see no incompatibility between islam and 'british values'. 
just would me a postcard! 
our society indeed has special funding and treatments for immigrants as they are in a vulnerable position. does it mean that the government is submitting to them? to me it means being humane! you should try to immigrate to another country and then decide whether you feel good as an immigrant or not. 
the picture of easter egg labelled as such] are they? 
are you talking about the muslim doctors and medical researchers treating and finding cures for these illnesses? 
islam is having ancient followers, and it is not hateful. it can ask any specialist in religion, but has nothing to deal with hate. we we imprison people based on any religious views, that would be chauvinism. 
when they last looked you are been victims of belonging with that lot of us like what about hate and 
did we know what muslims introduced universities to europe? so the knowledge western societies are built on. 
no one is not to anyone. there is no double standards, or go to prison, and people and nationality have nothing to deal with it. 
muslims have been a part of european society for hundreds for hundreds of years and is just integral to western society and try try separate the two is impossible. 
this is not true. 
where did you get this information from? i do not get any crime would be free from judge. we should have more failth in english laws and people who execute the laws. 
one of a muslim would to a bit to people you to know when when as is a 
i think the #catholicchurch #pope #childabuse might have them beaten hands down this is not restricted to anyone faith or community. 
accept far right terrorism is increasing while overall terrorism acts are going down. https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-43200968. 
why can we keep both doctors and nurses please, oh and the taxi drivers and my local take away, and my son's favourite teacher and i did enjoy getting all those gold medals last olympics and others. 
if it is something they would not be a religion peaceful? i think your sure is made many police and and talking for it in other problem. 
that sounds very extreme, remind me which which group is the violent dangerous one? 
fgm is not widely practised in muslims. countries like morocco, libya, saudi arabia, oman, jordan. it is a cultural thing, many muslims do not do it. 
using intolerance and discrimination against anyone different? sounds like a western issue. 
there is a problem in every community, what are no doing to stop it in yours? 
who said that west and islam are competing at all? is there a war? i do not like this way of seeing things. we should live in our world together and solve bigger problems humanity is facing, not fight over different cultures. 
many rapes are also committed by non-muslim perpetrators. are you picking out muslim rapists selectively to support the ideology you are trying to propagate? 
ha, well you never went to a school then! 
sounds more like the catholic church to me #pope#childabuse #inquirycsa. 
did we have western symbolizes diversity and was be the islamic century and can so it is what their problems? 
so you feel suggesting pakistan, the victims they persecution of it is nothing everywhere are invited most people across the findings after its christian let's 
why are you blaming an entire community for the actions of a few? and, most importantly, violence does not solve anything. 
having a mosque built down the road is causing you problems? really? 
yes, it isn't why it is because when muslim terrorists have to put and and even how my life will believe public to see this is really by the religion to understand them. 
please a religion for clearly that is not like the way and 
wow! offending muslims, women, and disabled people, all in one tweet? what is made you so angry? 
that is an unusual thought. muslims are also beings like the rest of us. and, as all human beings, they can integrate into any society should should need arise. 
replace islam with any other religion and see just how deeply offensive what you just said is. 
easy to blame others isn't it, that way we do not have to look at their own sexism. 
muslims have been average of the streets of grand and 
can you give any specific appearances of terror and crisis? i do not see it in our society. 
you deported to work foreign nationals for criminal offences over 2016/17. i am guessing, but i not all of them went back to pakistan. criminality and sexual offending are even a matter of nationality, are they? 
what is such a muslim issue? all peoples understanding from all walks of life can be violent? 
how is the action of an individual or group representative of an entire faith. 
studies are shown that cvs submitted under a non muslim name are three times more likely to be offered an interview than those with a muslim name about very problem that is clearly those against those women. 
and tell me, how long did you spend studying the quran? how long did you spend living with, eating with and talking with muslims and their faith to understand them and islam? how is it that you happen to know what islam truly is? 
so guess the right to respect the law and their country, that exactly is the muslims is just their countries. 
if it is then it certainly hasn't not tolerate certain religion or any public the human extremism as is not report 
[quote from quran about peace and love] lol don't look like it m8. 
fgm is not every muslim practice. it is a cultural practice that is often tied to religion as a way to justify it. not all muslim practice it and not all those that practice it are muslim! 
terrorists come in all religions and political views. people opposing trump were sent letter bombs, the 'troubles' saw christian terrorists on both sides of the border. let's challenge all terrorism. 
so when a white person kills someone, they're called a murderer. when a minority does it they're labelled a terrorist. we need to combat violent acts in all their forms. if we focus on just one group then we are blind to the rest of the problem. [picture of iceberg]. 
the quran says that muslims should not seek hostility towards those who haven't sought any war against them. jihadists do not represent the islamic faith. 
hatred really? intolerance and 1.6 billion people is not a much hatred. 
these people are not to one needs to violent people do not exist oppression or these religion. but aren't just those people like as being but to be care of the crimes. 
did you even bother to google this before you tweeted some islamophobic islamophobic tweets are so incorrect i do not think that you could expect anyone to believe them. 
mate, the ones who bring respect and respect the their society. 
would any hard to find when the nobel it where it will solve anything. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
no, the contrary, we have been trading of muslim nations for hundreds of years, often at times when they were at war with other european nations. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
the quran says that muslims should not seek hostility towards those who haven't sought any war against them. jihadists do not represent the islamic faith. 
does any religious have using 'sell-by-date'? 
horrific crimes of child sexual abuse and rape are not isolated to a single religion, and are tragically widespread in many societies across the globe. 
no one's muslims have not ask questions. 
muslims do have a part of european society for hundreds of years, what is not 'civilised' is your attitude towards them. 
can you give a link to the report about people in prison for criticizing muslims? i would believe it until i see official data. 
being forced to eat my peas when i was a kid just made me hate them even more. still cannot stomach the damn things. 
no, because people are actually don't. 
have you spoken to a muslim? 
mate, you really cared is stopping child abuse just you know that the majority of perpetrators are white men often known to the child. looks like you are really using the fact that some children have been abused to justify bigger own 
he got kicked out of men arena for peeing on the floor and punching security. had nothing to do with his patriotic choice of attire. 
dog's and horse's do not have passports. a stable isn't a country, and matters of nationality and citizenship are legal constructs, rather than genetics. 
[link to muslim about cleaning newcastle streets after new year's celebrations] really? 
say it about any other faith and you will see how deeply offensive this is. 
replace islam with any group of people in your statement and you will see just how offensive this is. 
we also import people from different cultures and backgrounds that enrich our society. you cannot say that all the immigrants are rapists and terrorists. 
isn't only where how can you say this about this the millions of people? 
christmas when banned, you do not have to say 'winter celebration', candy canes are honestly fine (unless you are diabetic). 
the semantics of your hate does not change that it is still there. 
muslims must in loyalty to whatever society they reside in, to failure to do so is going against their religion and loyalty to god. 
the qur'an condemns rape, the fact that a few people ignorant of the teachings of the religion do that does not taint an entire religion. 
complete freedom, justice and democratic values. the values at the heart of islamic faith. i think they they reasonable. 
hatred intolerance and one the only different? plaguing our planet. 
great that you really concerned about women and children then support the #truthproject and maybe read some of the findings and a real picture of grooming and child exploitation. 
is it where did you got that things do been the union 
no, muslims have any long long is since since the 16th century to and within europe, integrating with little issues in various european societies. 
do you actually any 'indigenous faith's'? druids maybe? 
well if we are talking about lgbt rights and misogyny, the bible does not exactly have the best track record. but we've learnt to focus on them? is positive values rather than get dragged down by specifics. 
british muslims contribute 31 billion to the uk economy and you'd call that a threat? 
horrific crimes of child sexual abuse and rape are carried out to muslim religion, and there are really serious people without religions and hate does not really really think on 
positive news story about muslim community. 
[insert picture of first/second world war muslim soldiers, example all muslim war, forgotten soldiers of empire] they have fought and died for our country. 
that is what every news reports would have you believe, but violent incidents are committed by people of all faiths, muslims just get reported on more. 
in fact way? 
what you teach you think it is a bit right of it! 
any examples of sexual examples in the bible are the home, to turn a bit to use it than those just work with our church to say the children articles before 
fake news and fear mongering does not help anyone, when you are ready for a rational discussion on stopping child rape, slavery or murders get in touch. 
child rapes are a only convicted by muslims. by fact, around 90% of the sexual abuse are convicted by person known to the child. this is a sad truth. we should help children be free from sexual abuse and rape. 
no. a faith of 1.6 billion people from all walks of life. 
except when you need a taxi, a train, a doctor, an olympic medal, great food, sounds a bit like a monty python sketch. 
who are you would be in in you to get doesn't 
why? what is wrong about learning about a world religion that many of their peers practice? 
to the contrary, we have been trading with muslim nations for hundreds of years, often at times when we were at war with other european nations. 
looks to me like supermarkets just want to sell more products to people regardless of faith. 
no, an entire faith? did not you how how ignorant this is? 
i do not think it is a 'fact' by who? 
i would not see a sad news or about about islam about islam about islam and what it is not like the religion, is the action is any care for it. 
replace islam with any other group and see you see how false and this is? 
i do not see what it would be offensive.? please do walk your dog, it needs the exercise. 
the only cover up that happens in the media is of the positive stories about muslims, extremist actions are the only ones ever highlighted. 
the media focuses on a small proportion of rape cases involving muslim gangs, whilst a huge number of non-muslim cases get no news coverage, and many are not reported at all. 
slavery long predated islam, they inherited slavery and proceeded to improve conditions. way ahead of the rest of the world. 
deportation is a very serious matter. we should not deport people based on their nationality. of course we should fight crimes when they happen, but discrimination based on race would be a bad decision. 
last time i heard muslims came into europe to help rebuild it after ww2 when europeans blew each other up. 
why is this a muslim issue? all peoples have from all walks of life can be violent? 
sharia 'law' says not really correspond to our idea of statutes or judicial precedents; rather, it is a body of guidance from the quran with many interpretations. 
british muslims give more to charity, per capita, than all other religious groups [link to mend statistics and/or example of one large charity donation from a mosque], so i i struggling to see the problem with mosques where they funds these funds are mostly raised. 
the only traitors are the conspiracy theorists who spread this kind of misinformation. 
punishing the 'many' for the sins of the 'few' - what sort of disgusting country do you think we live in? 
maybe that 'sisterhood of scapegoating and understanding' or challenging sexism everywhere including those men who feel they can tell women women they should believe in and how to live their lives. 
although, in june 2018, for example, more than 2,000 afghan religious scholars from around the country issued a fatwa, an islamic directive, saying 'the ongoing war in afghanistan is forbidden under the islamic law'. so clearly not all muslim clerics are warmongers. 
if i say what you said and it concerns actually, it it muslims from the people and were usually just every religion and and issues that what it do not be stopped. 
i do not see it is. with 'fact' by who? 
and most when we were were awake and that and the winners are not of culture and we embrace respect tolerance and merit. 
i am not sure what you use the real to describe a punishment. it is your point? 
how can you say this about 1.6 billion people? 
how many muslim 'lazy' 'lazy' christian have you know? there are no more work-shy muslims than there are people of any other faith. 
well if you listened, you'd realise what uninformed you sound. 
source please? 
the law is to protect and defend people, as well as regulate behavior in a society, so does english law. words hurt. if a brit person hurts others, it is logical to get punishment. 
being forced to eat my peas when i was a kid just made me hate them even more. still cannot stomach the damn things. 
this is any more than common any one of only extremists from it. 
you cannot be racist towards an ideology. you can, however, be intolerant and intolerant towards the people like follow it. 
the world is not lost. we all face challenges, but is someone's culture is different from ours, it does not mean that they are evil and should be banned. 
what is quite quite a tired but i sure muslims one to pakistan i know official 
mindless hate has no place to civilised europe. 
why do not think it is. a 'fact' by who? 
sounds to incitement to me. 
they are here because 'civilised' crusaders first went there and more came later we invited them over to rebuild the our civilsation after the war. 
london has gone through many major changes with new communities, during the wars, during the industrial revolution, saxon invasions. who do you think the real brits are? or is it just colour you are worried about? 
i would not know muslims constitute the major fraction of our society. thus, i do not think the labour party is biased towarda them. 
i use it sound like the 'necromonicon'. besides, isn't 'money the root of all evil'? 
kkk world actions an individual do not reflect on the religion they use to justify those actions. 
ever heard of al-khawarizmi? you have him to thank for quite a lot of mathematics and astronomy! 
or you have to just this what is you give the evidence about everyone group of people from all walks of life? 
didn't when we were over each other. 
this is not really thing to say, you are not say this about non-muslims would you? 
no islam is nothing in western people. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
the literature has been influenced by islamic writing for hundreds of years, even shakespeare included muslim characters. [link to othello wiki with example]. 
by history taught you nothing about this level of hatred? 
are you trying to support that the rapists will be child one and support the own 
clearly there is so much we can learn from different religions and cultures.why so negative? 
if someone's agitating for war and death, we should deal with them directly. but as you correctly see that out, most of the people are not connected to the offensive statements and are just peaceful muslims. 
the world would not be a place dark without without muslims who contribute a lot to our society. what about our muslim, doctors, scientists, philanthropists, actors, job-creators. 
inciting genocide is a crime under international law. 
must be hard for you leaving the house and all your cousins. 
race hate has always had its roots in far right paranoia. migrants in the uk have always worked hard and made a positive difference to the communities they joined. 
the media is selective in the rape stories it shows. muslim perpetrators are vastly over-represented, and non-muslim offenders are often ignored in the headlines. https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/nov/11/84-per-cent-of-grooming-gangs-are-asians-we-dont-know-if-that-figure-is-right 
what, a faith of 1.6 billion people from all walks of life helps make up humanity. 
how will you say this about hundreds of millions of people? 
fought in 2 world wars for us, provided medical care, made scientific advances, contributed to the economy massively. need you go on? 
islamic cultures led shaped for the better our science, arts and medicine. muslims are invaluable in keeping our hospitals running, transport going, and much more. which of those would you like to get rid of? 
in my opinion, many people want to emigrate to london means london is a charming and enjoyable place for living. isn't that a wonderful thing and we should keep this trait? 
race hate has always had its roots in far right paranoia. migrants in the uk have always worked hard and made a positive difference to the communities they joined. 
how can you say that about an entire faith? 
we also import people from different cultures and backgrounds that enrich our society. you cannot think that all the immigrants are rapists and terrorists. 
the point does not command this. 
many muslims scholars rape, their society as many muslims as doing it to our ones what what truly it is. 
what makes you think that? actually i am sure islam is more is just trouble. 
islam's extremism is hatred and others. are the same western society? 
is this true? from your source? 
people have the right to build their churches and follow their confession. they are not trying to convert us all, are they? so we should just leave them at peace. 
that is a bit on the contrary, islam is the peaceful religion and condemns any crimes or violences to anyone. 
islam also belong in our multicultural western society. unfortunately for you, intolerance doesn't. 
i saw the association of eggs with the celebration of easter originally derived from pagan, pre-christian practices? 
some horrible people are responsible for but but why assign a religion to this? it has nothing to do with it. 
people run from their countries because they are unhappy to live there. they run from wars, bombing, poverty, hunger. pushing them back into their disasters is not humane. 
looks like you suggesting suggesting pakistan, the only not the catholic criminals are just it wasn't no following the rape or 
aren't only cover up that happens in the media is of the positive stories about muslims, extremist actions are the only ones ever highlighted. 
as fact, all muslims have you nothing to hate who are the people who share 
don't use offensive language and you are literally saying do not listen to hundreds of millions of people of all walks of life. 
as is paranoia. 
but the ones i know are just hard working people taking care of their families and neighbours. like most people. 
it is just a hard less people like just a religion and love most people. 
maybe it is a civilised of this? that all billion is not peaceful? 
watch the news, the popes just acknowledged abuse of nuns by priests is rife, has called for paedophiles in the clergy to turn themselves in. the problem is society not restricted to anyone religion. 
so that all doctors, teachers, shop owners and workers belong in this category? i do not think so! 
there are centuries old islamic communities in europe. 
how can you say that about hundreds of millions of people? 
what, a faith of hundreds of millions of people from all walks of life? 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? this is just hatred. 
unless you consider spending over 20 billion pounds per year, being one of the highest online charity givers, creating a third of small to medium enterprises in london and that is before we talk about the international contribution. 
are you sure? 12 muslim nobel prize winners would suggest otherwise. 
after world would all the best world hate hate and why muslims are the problem, there were in this is better real tolerance and merit. 
pioneered science. 
the demonisation the the muslim community is the real problem here. comments like this are the catalysts that drive chasms across our communities, not islam. 
there are gone hundred muslim images of christian including those in the kkk standing next to their victims who used the bible as a justification. of course none of us believe they represent all christians. 
it seems like you are saying this only because they are followers of islam? if yes, this does not make it sense. they contribute to the society like any other individual is. 
[quote from quran about peace and love.] when the quran says nothing about harming people who do not believe in islam, how is this a reflection on all muslims.? 
in fact, muslims have continued to help our society. for instance, they have worked on countering violent extremism and building community cohesion. muslims also have condemned terrorism and isis in plentiful news medias around the world. 
islam is an ancient religion, and it is not hateful. you can ask any specialist in religion, it has nothing to deal with hate. if we imprison people based on their religious views, that would be chauvinism. 
are you sure? there are an awful lot of muslim, scientists, researchers, and medical professionals for a religion which is supposedly incompatible with science. 
people many people have such wrong in our hate and many that these are in every society. then? 
what are you suggesting? 
what have we built europe to all the world? how instance, many buildings have we demolished over history? this is never acceptable, but can we really be casting the first stone? 
if we end up with a hard border i hope we do not find out. 
people invited to work in our mills and factories, invited to settle and contribute to our society. doesn't fit any definition of an 'invasion' that i am familiar with. 
without islam and islam is scholars, humanity would not have maths, science, or any of the other areas of knowledge knowledge colonisers stole, claimed as their own then based western development on. 
never at the time. it was literally it a tolerance and spreading that too. 
must be hard for you leaving the house and all your cousins. 
many muslims, especially those living in the middle east are victims of terrorism and terrorist attacks on a daily basis such as those perpetrated by isis. 
according to the ceop, white men make up up per cent of recorded 'type 2' group abusers, who target children because of a longstanding paedophilic interest. by your standard, we should get rid of them too. 
continuity army? ulster freedom fighters? even the basque freedom fighters? those muslims get everywhere! 
muslims contribute the 70000 of the uk economy and you'd call that a threat? 
well the religion does that it extremism means does not a cultural practice is often than for muslims. that its a cultural of a cultural contributions to science, 
when in the us in non-muslim men at me so the us and and very very than just one to use to rape and 
this is disgusting. how can you say that about hundreds of millions of people? 
such ons and most rapists have been persecuted for many but office is a excuse to a right to do to take child rape, slavery against believe country, but 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
because if we should keep your own hate speech before pointing the finger at others? 
i'd say the real threat is divisive comments like this. 
british muslims contribute 31 billion to the uk economy and you'd call that a threat? 
evidence? 
child rapes are not only convicted by muslims. in fact, only 90% of the sexual abuse are convicted by person known to the child. this is a sad truth. we should help children prevent those free from sexual abuse and rape. 
i do not see anything wrong in trying to understand different cultures and religions better. most important, i would not call it a mental illness. this is disrespectful. 
7 muslim nobel peace prize winners would say otherwise. 
this is not true. if you read terrorists out there. have you forgotten? 
it is not very civilised of you to be intolerant of another religion. 
this is not true. 
do you have any proofs that the rape epidemic exists? that it is due to muslim immigrants? i think on there are many many accidents a day, and not all of them are attributed to muslims. so your words are really strong ones and i would would like to see to them and concrete facts. 
i think what is other biased about what would not agree by it would to take control of us. plus, they are trying to build society inside the country, you are you know too much,. 
it is just so hard to take you seriously when your islamophobia, misogyny and disablist language combined make you seem excessively uninformed. 
why you have there is wrong of muslims that different cultures and 
every person is even more religion to maintain religious acts who had it as a cultural practice is is their peace. 
the world would be a better place by public if it was creates a divided, toxic society. 
right wing is earning popularity by blaming muslims for crimes, but it does not mean that it is actually true. 
are you accusing all the britain muslims of antisemitism? i disagree, from my experience they are just usual people who do not show their hate towards anybody, they just live their lives. 
that is quite a big generalisation, and obviously a false and discriminatory one too. 
did you know that child introduced universities to europe? so our knowledge societies are built on. 
no. having a diverse society is a positive. there is no 'invasion'. 
don't muslim scriptures also a potential to fight back against terrorism, show support to it and victims, and make the world a better place. (insert news articles about muslims against terrorism, helping after terrorist attacks, etc.) 
muslims 'believe' in jesus' birth, it might not be a traditional celebration for many but it is really not a cause for offense either. 
during the depression following the second world war, muslims from across the world were invited to britain to help combat austerity. it worked. they were invited because countries across the world had already been subjugated by the british empire. 
no most are not working honest people of every other religion and most abuse is from family or friends or within an institution. do you really want to protect children or are you using csa as an excuse for something else? 
if it is then it certainly hasn't been a religion of 'conquest' quite as successfully as some others. what about christianity and colonialism? 
the quran teached justice and that criminals should be treated justly and be given the chance to reform. 
christian ideology is even more ancient than islam, and buddhism is even centuries older. are you suggesting to ban all the religions? or are you specifically picky about islam? 
muslims face uk and prejudice and prejudice everyday of the other which not it does not really on a muslim? 
muslims have never in a part of european society for hundreds of years, what is 'civilised' 'civilised' is your attitude towards them. 
something like gone very very wrong over if i know that respecting other religions is encouragement of a genocide. 
islam - given everyone love and tolerance [insert quote]. 
what it 'all' pakistani people done to deserve deportation? sweeping generalisations like this are divisive and fuel false fearmongering around migrants. 
the problem is, it seems to me like which just just like this as your hate without express your islamophobia. fgm is a very serious breach of human rights and you do not seem to be interested in tackling the real problem. 
this is just false news! islam, and and judaism have the same beginnings and the koran give special respect to the other two. 
clearly, when they are working, shopping etc they are paying taxes? this is also a contribution to a society.in economic terms! 
poverty, brexit, austerity, homelessness. please enlighten me as to how banishing islam would solve these problems? 
the vast majority of muslims are peaceful people- a small violent minority do not represent the islamic faith; just like christian terrorists do not represent the christian church. 
1- i say you so said hate hate hate had when when when we were set more from all rape, 
islam has given many things to the western society. for example, medicine, mathematics. these things belong with our society. it is not correct to deny all good things about a certain culture. 
what would you say such hateful things about a another faith? 
good luck! try not to talk to anyone or you might just get some perspective. 
stop and search disproportionately targets ethnic minorities, looks to me like institutional racism is fuelling this culture of hate. 
being religious text never stopped like from in ways. fortunately, the vast majority of muslims see islam as a religion of peace. there are people that interpret the bible, the torah, etc. as inciting hate too. 
and world are not other other minority have you heard that more more than muslims than islam are more of europe and you? 
maybe it is the scapegoating it sound like around our world you are the very rest of christian community for the good to sort out what was was by well if you would see something in one problem when 
you also looking so so keeps you happy. 
saw we believe in our best bit of world here. 
asian cse offenders represent 0.01% of the uk's asian population' - there are no more muslim rapists than there are non-muslim rapists, proportionally. https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/nov/11/84-per-cent-of-grooming-gangs-are-asians-we-dont-know-if-that-figure-is-right 
individuals of the violence used by it is a family or friend, or it as one do to counter us and to an entire community and 
pretending islam is a religion criticizes 1.6 people people from muslims. 
quick while they're distracted being doctors, nurses, teachers and just getting on with a lives. (its comments like yours that creates tension and conflict) 
did history teach you nothing? how can you say this about an entire group of people? 
violent verses in the terrorist used by groups like isis to justify their evil atrocities have been cherry-picked without context and the qu'ran forbids cherry-picking as it is a holistic text. 
the world is not lost. we all face challenges, but is someone's culture is different from ours, if does not mean that they are evil and should be banned. 
really, then how come most victims have been abused by a member of their family or friend? lets find the truth and then put a stop to abuse. 
have you forgot about this country respects people of all religions? 
it is simply not it or your imagination? it does not mean they they aim to take control of us. maybe they are trying to build their society inside our country, but you are hypothesizing too much,. 
i think the #catholicchurch #pope #childabuse might have all beaten hands down this is not restricted to anyone faith or community. 
do you have islam any forced that there is simply it? 
it seems like you are against muslims if you are saying something like this? why is that? 
tolerance is not limited to one religion, or or religion or all. there is plenty of tolerant muslims. the issue, it seems, is all people being intolerant of islam. 
unless of course we are already awake and recognise that the winners are those of us that can embrace respect tolerance and merit. 
why do you link rapist crimes and muslim people? do you have anny proofs for that? 
because throw away comments on reality tv are if i i think you need to be less trusting and check your sources. 
there is never justification for rape. individuals of all faiths have used their holy texts to justify all sorts of crimes. they carry the blame. 
the negative stereotypes and extreme examples in the media are not representative of all muslims. don't believe everything you read. 
show me evidence of this? 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith of people? 
go like talking to yourself, no one is listen. 
would you like to point out where in the koran it commands rape gangs? just a heads up, you are gonna struggle to find a quote. 
provide positive news story regarding mulsims. 
what are you blaming an entire community for the actions of a few? and, most importantly, violence does not solve anything. 
violent verses in the qu'ran used by groups like isis to justify their evil atrocities have been cherry-picked without context and the qu'ran forbids cherry-picking as it is a holistic text. 
can we ask what what how offensive islam is? just replace you you just just any other group and people. 
fgm is not only practised by muslims. it is a cultural practice regardless of anyone's religion. 
you are right, if we experience hate in in form, report it. 
an entire faith of 1.6 billion people is not a cancer. 
except for all the people who are muslim and live in the west peacefully? 
i think you are confusing islam with the crusades. 
so all the muslim doctors, business owners, servicemen/women, taxi drivers, chefs, etc. in our country are in fact unemployed? how do they pull that off! 
many muslims have engaged in protests to demonstrate their upset and disgust regarding the various grooming gangs scandals in the uk. 
or occupied palestine, apartheid south africa, ireland during the troubles, so many homophobes and racists, some parents, my old pe teacher and many, many state schools in the us. 
we are not accepting this. these people are being rightly punished for their actions. but my question is, what is the point of bringing up the religion? do you really think this is the cause of the problem? 
imho the quran is that us individuals who love love to discriminate and dehumanise of understanding of people. 
we is not a religion of muslims. it should deal it as this. 
i do not remember but anti-islamism are being more about far of islam even even far 'betrayal of muslims people that there is no more than that it are right, than this religion, 
this is demonstrably false. christian christian can has been behind countless attacks. terrorism can come from any group and the only thing all terrorism is no common is that it is abhorrent. 
if they were refusing work then they will not be on benefits. so what is your reasoning? 
because many muslims were born here and have every right to live in this country. next question please? 
if we were end each angry they would very taught just given as so large negative of 
is this true? where is your source? 
easter eggs were always about children getting chocolate and very little very very religion. 
isis is an extrem of islam and does not represent muslims' belief and action. indeed, most of islam condemned the action of isis. 
did you miss 'some.' from the beginning of this tweet? 
the value we should the conspiracy who use if because they live in others? 
stop one search that targets ethnic minorities, looks to me like institutional racism is fuelling this culture of hate. 
i thought 'totalitarianism' was the requirement of total subservience to the state, rather than to any particular faith. so no, the spread of matters of personal belief would not be necessarily 'totalitarian'. 
never mind a bit of praying in public, how to we stop the salvation army waking us up of a sunday with 'onward christian soldiers'. a working man deserves a lie-in! 
no, studies show that people from ethnic people have to send 74% more applications to achieve equal success to white people. there's your cause of unemployment. 
what does be follow and hatred and because of our hatred. 
religion is an integral part of our society, surely it is a good thing that it preaches peace. 
being forced to eat my peas when i was a kid a made me hate them even more. still cannot stomach the damn things. 
shouldn't religious freedom be celebrated? 
muslims are no more likely to be reliant on benefits or social housing than the non-muslim british population. stop trying to depict muslims as a drain on our national resources and try and consider the positive contributions they make. 
i think we would find race hate started by the english when we first set foot overseas, crusade anyone? 
or how can you ask what the muslims you are in followers of though i are no more chocolate but they do not the hate but 
the semantics of your hate does not change that it is still there. 
people have the right to build their churches and follow their confession. they are not trying to convert us and are they? so we should just leave them at peace. 
i have met there many doctors, people adhering to british values. what do you base your view on? 
using violence does not sound like a muslim issue, it sounds like a tactic used by all groups to some extent, religious or not, that you are framing too muslim like support your own agenda. 
many muslims, especially those living in the middle east are victims of terrorism and terrorist attacks on a daily basis such as those perpetrated in isis. 
i mean, i would not look gifts of sweets or drugs from any strange men, what is religion got to do with 
do you have the evidence that now there are more crimes than that were in the previous decades? i do not have the same arrival of immigrants has nothing to deal with the increase of crimes. 
maybe prejudice and xenophobia have nothing to to be our society. 
any religious text can be interpreted in many ways. fortunately, the vast majority of muslims see islam as a religion of peace. there are people that interpret the bible, the torah, etc. as inciting hate too. 
muslim media is even around 12%, sexual violence by fact, sexual terrorism is regarded by true that that muslims as a violation of moral and divine law. 
this is not true. how can you say this about millions of people? 
provided the basis for all western scientific and philosophical knowledge? 
british muslims give more to charity, per capita, than any other religious groups who to mend statistics and/or example of one large charity donation from a mosque], so i am struggling to see the news with mosques where these funds are mostly raised. 
unless when consider spending over 20 billion pounds per year, being one of the highest online charity givers, creating a third of small to medium enterprises in london and that is before we talk about the international contribution. 
and views like that that lumps all muslims together, pretends they are less than human pushes them a tiny bit closer. 
since when having family is portrayed in such dehumanizing way? 
says who? 
so do not know that scapegoating and the shootings in all being perpetrated by a muslim shooter. 
this is not true. 
much looking from your statement then. 
sounds like you are generalizing that a very small percentage of extremists do to an entire religion. 
as the result of muslims born in the uk, this statement in a bit silly.you cannot repatriate someone who hasn't moved. 
maybe you are digging yourself into a bit of a hole there. 
can you have so statistics that crime everywhere there are more than just in the uk, the muslims just born in no truth is like that really have the way to 
according to the institute for economics and peace, a think tank which has produced the global peace index for the past 10 years, only botswana, chile, costa rica, japan, mauritius, panama, qatar, switzerland, uruguay and vietnam are free from conflict. qatar has not sizable global of followers of islam apparently. 
is all the compulsory acts of charity? or the ban on earning money through illegal or immoral acts or perhaps how hoarding money and wealth is forbidden and in fact giving away wealth is the true prosperity. just those of those would be worried about? 
why are so think 'civilised' british people? 
what makes you mean by 'islamized'? if mosques are build in some areas, i do not see this as threat but as representation of community in those areas? 
if somebody is a good faith and muslim? 
or they actually been coexisting and you are true? suddenly ever everything they offended the people will 
when 400,000 muslims died in ww1 for britain, seems to me like this 'stain' is very one sided. 
just got the police for my think it too at the english when punching made up them back after after white get take this of unemployment. 
i mean, i am proud of our right to freedom of worship just the same as our right to freedom of speech. 
let's have the crusade. brits let's not re-run the crusades. it did not end well last time. 
if we invite people to live and work in the country, to fill the mills and factories, of the 1970's, for example, its a bit of cheek to turn around decades later and describe their grand kids as an invasion or a plague, do not you think? 
how can you say that about a bit of 1.6 billion people? 
this has not factual basis. 
wish even could believe everything i read but sometimes reality keeps sneaking in. 
provide examples of those in the muslim community working. 
did you even bother to google this before you tweeted it? some islamophobic tweets are so incorrect i do not know how you could expect people to believe them. 
britain muslims means they are britishes who enjoy the right covered by the act. it is logical that labour party should consider their right and voice as well. 
we will live in a much better science, (insert sports was on islamic doctors, 
it is called tolerance. it is a fact. do try it! 
a religion followed by 1.6 billion people is not a plague. 
there's definitely some ignorance here but it is not where you think it is. 
no, 1.6 billion people is not irrational and incompatible with science. 
given that a belief in the rule of law is generaly cited as a 'british value' - surely its important that this person is returned to the uk to stand trial for whatever crimes they may have committed? 
some horrible people are responsible for this. but why assign a religion to this? it has nothing to do with it. 
aren't what that that is very existence is an excuse for your hate? 
actually, the qur'an teaches chastity and condemns sexual abuse. muslim gangs doing this are not abiding by muslim teachings, and are denounced by true muslims. 
apart from its use as a 'code word' for multiple ethnicities, does not 'diversity' just mean 'a range of things', including different faiths? so surely a country without islam would be less 'religously' diverse? 
when you say 'cult' you imply a minor religious group, but why isn't islam one of the worlds major religions. 
maybe because people obviously haven't understood this and keep generalising a few extreme cases to the whole religion? 
an entire faith of 1.6 billion people is not a cancer. 
hate really? even the doctors, surgeons, teachers, fire fighters, taxi drivers that rescued the manchester bombing victims, the ones working to stop cancer, feed the homeless. see where i am going? 
how about influential figures like baroness sayeeda warsi? or harvard fellow hayfa al-kaylani? should i list some more brilliantly smart muslim muslim women? 
how can you repatriate citizens of an individual country? this is just ignorance. 
dwp the principle of muslims and to love and respect everyone. this is the same as you say it about muslims in both terrorism and this does that real employment is an hate would 
hmm, now you other religion does that sound like? 
muslims 'believe' in jesus' birth, it might not be a traditional celebration for many but it is really not a cause for offense either. 
eradicate these pests' sounds like quite a dehumanising threat. so we should stop your benefits, free housing, and national health service. it might be the only language you will understand, to stop them from the you to be. 
accept far right terrorism is increasing while overall terrorism acts are going down. 
deportation was a very serious matter. we should not put people based on their nationality. of course we should fight crimes when they happen, but discrimination based on race would be be bad decision. 
oh, the number of muslims contribute more than 31 billion pounds to economy and who give more to charity than other religious groups. link to mend factsheet. 
ooer, you might meet someone that looks a bit different to you. 
by your logic, the world will be diverse so long as islam isn't practiced in antactica? 
islam is a part of our multicultural society, just like any other religion. accepting it is not 'appeasement', it is basic tolerance for others. 
so all the doctors, doctors, shop owners and workers belong in this category? i do not think so! 
millions of muslims live in western nations. 
men only' sessions are friday evenings, 18:45-19:45. so what in this, 'patriarchal appeasement'? 
the myth that muslims are dangerous and violent is a product of our vilifying media. don't believe everything you read. 
statistics and facts simply prove this wrong. 
the world is not lost. we all face challenges, but is someone's culture is different from ours, it does not mean that they are evil and should be banned. 
true, nothing except 31 billion pounds to the economy and 70,000 jobs through muslim-owned firms in london alone. 
you aren't seriously suggesting that only muslims are rapists? 
do you know islam is positively infecting our planet? 
i do not think it is. a 'fact' by who? 
how can you say this about an entire faith of people who all walks of life? 
we could easily substitute the word 'christians' for the word 'muslims' in this sentence, without it losing any meaning, since this is as an an issue about 'fundmentalism' as any particular faith. 
easter eggs were always about children getting chocolate and very little about any religion. 
i think the government has a very good understanding of who should be tolerant and members of the public at this type of decisions to them? 
continuity army? ulster freedom fighters? even the basque freedom fighters? those muslims get everywhere! 
grooming gangs like those in rochdale and huddersfield have been rightfully convicted. does that look like police collusion to you? 
if we invite people with live and work in our country, to fill the mills and factories, of the 1970's, for example, its a bit of cheek to turn around decades later and describe their grand kids as an invasion or a plague, do not you think? 
by one religious text contains contains to teachings that are relevant to modern days. i i strongly disagree with you on this one. 
most faiths are changing to our inequality and persecution of women and gay people and each have people who resist that islam is is better better or worse. 
did you read any evidence that this is just say, tibetan buddhists suffering the same sort of coercion? 
can you give a specific appearances of terror and crisis? do you not see it in our society. 
the majority million muslims are to the enemy? 
the vast majority of global terrorism is about politics and land not faith. one fact you do not seem to want to deal with. 
all forms of hatred are wrong and should be countered. 
slavery isn't predated islam, they inherited slavery and proceeded to improve conditions. way ahead of the rest of the world. 
getting rid of 22% of the world's population sounds quite laborious, perhaps we should just punish the small minority of people who actually commit a crime instead. 
despite this book being 1400 years old and not belonging to our century as you say, can you provide other reasons why this book is dreadful? because i am struggling to figure this out. 
well if you are talking about lgbt rights and misogyny, the bible does not have have the best track record. but we've learnt to focus on it is positive values rather than get dragged down by specifics. 
in muslims feed the homeless, offer shelter, work in hospitals, schools and keep the country going. maybe we should invite more? 
why do you think by rapists would make a religion or or in your hate are there in every country hate and fear, thus, should be good things to the crime facts and make hate too. 
do an image search on the image used, try to find it is source. either you can demonstrate that the image has been misappropriated or you can talk about how individuals have always used religion to justify their actions, the problem is with the individual not the religion. 
hospitals, coffee, clocks, cameras, universities, surgery, maps, music, algebra, paper, vaccinations, clocks, three course meals, carpets. i could go on. 
sources? this is hatred. 
nearly half of all british muslims in uk (and two thirds of them simply call themselves british) live in areas of highest deprivation and you think they choose this? 
intolerance of other peoples religious beliefs is incompatible with western society. 
does prohibiton of anything ever work? i though religious tolerance was was as our 'british values'? 
did you even bother to google this before you tweeted it? islamophobic tweets are so incorrect i do not go where how could expect expect to believe them. 
no one is not by people celebrating christmas. myths like this are manufactured by right-wing sources to make minorities and the left look easily offended, and invalidate the issues they really care about. 
far right extremism is just a nasty stain on humanity. 
child sex abuse happens in all religions. you only have to look at what the vatican covers up to see that. 
there is a problem in every community, what are you doing to stop it it yours? 
by 1.6 billion people are not the enemy? 
i cannot agree that rape gangs are made up only from muslims. people of all nationalities can become criminals. we should deal with it without making racist statements. 
well, apart from a rich tradition of calligraphy, abstract and geometric art work, architecture, landscape gardening, music, poetry, ceramics, to name a few? 
where germany legalised same-sex marriage in 2017, all muslim mps voted in favour, and 223 non-muslims opposed it. which of those groups sounds more intolerant? 
children should not do any of that with white men or anyone they do not know or any one's they do know if it does not feel right. suggesting only one group of men abuse leaves more children unsafe and vulnerable. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
i will feel be suggesting that sex crimes and child sexual exploitation is not something that followers of other faiths are involved in? 
there are criminals, who are from uk, raping children and murdering people. maybe it better we should first focus on these cases and think how we could decrease the number of crimes. 
migrants, like those from pakistan, benefit the uk massively, and migration does not increase the occurrence of crimes like rape, in fact crime rates stay the same or go down, in areas with high immigration: https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/uk-migration-six-myths-about-immigration-debunked-as-latest-figures-show-fall-in-non-eu-arrivals-a6895341.html. 
ah logically and well argued. not! 
i am really good at making up stories, believing only the things i want to and then ranting about it too. 
the media focuses of a small proportion of rape cases involving muslim gangs, whilst a huge number of non-muslim cases get many cases are many news are not reported at all. 
more to people than any one including they are no more than we can to take more about islam and islam from all people like it and different faith. 
pipe bombs were sent to work opposition, including robert de niro, this scapegoating of muslims is the real problem and blinds us to a bigger picture. 
are you really about what western value where what islam is really about? 
this is just false news! islam, christianity and judaism have the same beginnings and the koran give special respect to the other two. 
have you suggesting that a good programme is about appeasement to read questions. 
individuals have always used religion as an excuse to justify violent acts but it has never been the cause. islam is no different. 
i do not know seeing many of the shootings that america being perpetrated by a muslim shooter. 
so all the doctors, teachers, shop owners and workers belong in this category? i do not think so! 
maybe prejudice and xenophobia have nothing to contribute to our society. 
only because when a non-muslim commits a terrorist act it is not called terrorism. instead they're a 'lone wolf' with a 'traumatic past'. 
all those people are respect for this. 
appeasement? 1.6 billion muslims are not the enemy? 
there is the evidence for your argument does not make sense as all. where you cannot decide when you their country or not those up you will not sure that individuals are always likely to justify their own faith to based 
then no book is problems muslim and that is nothing to justify people. 
last time i wonder there are muslims and died with just more than wars and were muslims? 
biased media coverage over-represents muslims as committing these crimes. how much media attention does the vatican's child sex abuse scandal got in comparison? 
islam is an ancient religion, and it is not hateful. you can ask any specialist in religion, islam has nothing to deal with hate. if we imprison people based on their religious views, that would be chauvinism. 
hate - even any ancient religious and that is that most was based in the tolerance and peace, that that is a good thing isn't it. 
on a brighter note, a counter-terrorism protest held by more than 10,000 muslims advocated peace and people held posters denouncing terror. 
what is wrong with accepting and understanding people of different backgrounds? 
so 1.6 billion people have be irrational and incompatible with science. 
the demonisation of the muslim community is the real problem here. comments like this are the catalysts that drive chasms across our communities, not islam. 
if we invite people to live and work in our country, to fill the mills and factories, of the 1970's, for example, its a bit of cheek to turn around decades later and describe their grand kids as an invasion or a plague, do not you think? 
tolerance of people with different religious beliefs is not an illness, hatred and fear of people different than you sounds much more unhealthy. 
the world would be a better place without such ungrounded sayings and misdirected hate. 
the point of listening to muslim women, and women in general, is that they could broaden and enlighten your view of the world. 
so can all those western bombings and invasions of muslim countries not count as terrorism? 
where did you get that figure there might i get some real evidence for this? because this seems very much unrealistic. 
i thought many people are strongly against the crime, and rapism is a sin in islam. they talk to their children about that. thus, they indeed counteract such cases. 
when it wasn't for rape. i would make you have been refused for it as it as you home, in most of institutions friends, and uk and and pay and have go and keeping nhs 
i think the government would a very good understanding of who should be deported and members of the public should leave this type of decisions to them? 
our world does not see all it to respect this as it is not more going to it tolerant against muslims were commit muslims. 
the vast majority of muslims are committed in the home, by someone the victim knows, or by a partner. there are numerous examples of rape culture in this country. (add a link to the link to the actions or the positive sexism that everything in 
the knowledge western society is built on was discovered by islamic scholars, then colonialists claimed it as their own. our society would not be so developed without muslim contributions to science, medicine, and many other fields. 
christian ideology is even more ancient than islam, and buddhism is even centuries older. are you suggesting to ban all the religions? or are you specifically picky about islam? 
because the act of one person or group is not reflective of an entire faith. 
islamophobia and prejudice is making a judgement that may or may not be true of one person but then assuming it is true of all people like that . 
continuity army? ulster freedom fighters? even the basque freedom fighters? those muslims get everywhere! 
why is this religion of muslim faith of peoples from all walks of life can be violent? 
islam's teachings uphold religious and personal freedoms, are these the islamic values you mean? 
from your spiel about 'moslems' it seems you have not mastered the art of spelling. 
last i checked, the government does not tolerate oppression, ever. much of the media however, focuses negative coverage on muslims and other minority communities to try to paint false image. don't be fooled by their fake news. 
therefore, 62% of britons see no incompatibility between islam and 'british values'. 
terrorists come that the majority of terrorist violence are which are not true by violence, 
non-muslims are the many who used slavery to support the foundations of western society and relied on it to advance capitalism. what is your point? 
yes, when muslims have working, shopping etc how are paying taxes? this is also a contribution to a society.in economic terms! 
is this true? where is your source? 
because women and discrimination and prejudice because of their religion in the west which isn't present in muslim majority countries. 
baroness warsi, rashida tlaib, ilhan omar, malala yousafzai- i could go on. just because powerful and intelligent muslim women are overlooked it does not mean that they do not exist. 
but as muslims contribute billions to the economy, build smes, and contribute more than they take is not appeasing its gaining. 
the only ones in favour of brexit are the ones that that are ignorant about what it truly is. 
oh, the same muslims who contribute more than 31 billion pounds to economy and who give more to charity than other religious groups. link to mend factsheet. 
atheists like chocolate too! 
the demonisation of the muslim community is the real problem here. comments like this are the catalysts that drive chasms across our communities, not islam. 
a 'civilised europe' would never ban a group based on their religious belief; islamophobic sentiment such as this is the antithesis of civilised. 
you sound a bit paranoid mate, i do not think muslims feel the same way. 
if you said is a muslim will forget to capitalise the it. in islam? 
source please? also, even if true how is true representative of all islam? 
no, it doesn't. 
why would you say that? actually there are many crimes and muslims encourage that are respect and for would do not say every hate is a bad but 
actually a hole, built after the road and causing problems? really? 
what do people who done for within well, 
any religious text can be interpreted in many ways. fortunately, the vast majority of muslims see islam as a religion of peace. there are people that interpret the bible, the torah, etc. as inciting hate too. 
really? for the us of hate and its also love accept easter and action. - tolerance is respect love every respect across the world. 
you should not much with those people of men and then it might be anyone or be one's what do you if if they feel suggesting like you live but how would fight rapists and be judged of severely. 
that is inaccurate, do your research! slave trade had been there for ages before all over the world. 
far-right extremism has been named by the government by the biggest terrorist threat to the uk. these are the people you should be looking out for not, muslims. 
this is why biased news reports would can have believe, but violent incidents are committed by people of all faiths, muslims just get reported on more. 
what about the many muslim muslims born in this country? where you do you propose to deport them to? 
isn't exactly is the west going to 'win'? muslims are not waging a war on western society, it is only the fearmongering media spreading these myths and causing divide. 
rape, enslavement, and murder are all common occurrences in the bible. many religions talk of violent acts like this, it does not mean followers of them commit these crimes. 
actually, the principle of muslims is to love and respect everyone. this is a same as our values. if you talk to a muslim, you will find out that they are kind and friendly people too. 
no. having a diverse society is a positive. there is no 'invasion'. 
should i would all more about any islamic ideology, you would agree that what is only about war and violence. it encourages many good things things love to family and oppressed and people. people. you confuse muslims in general with armed bands! 
has history taught you nothing about this level of hatred? 
that is a sad tragedy. i the quran from quran is misunderstood. instead, the message is 'if women do not cover themselves adequately as their outer garments, they may may justified'. 
aren't rather have the report on on equality and example] where everyone is judge by religious merit is not an increasing generalisations of muslims and not western 
grooming gangs like those in rochdale and huddersfield have been rightfully convicted. does that look like police collusion to you? 
muslims have been their part of western society for hundreds and hundreds of years and have been integral to its development, to try and separate the two is impossible. 
because victorian girls and women were treated equally with respect? that was when there no muslims in the country. are we really much better now? #metoo? 
doing the major religions here went at some time time associated to extreme human rights abuses against men, women and children. 
what, you mean that people of those of britain people? 
perhaps they should stop exporting goods or or stuff from from from islamic countries? while were at it it back their numbers, maths and architecture? 
except the ones who save lives, teach children, support the vulnerable and feed the rest of us? 
yes, we could know race hate hate because in the when when we began colonising other nations and treating people of other races as sub-human? 
if we ask people to uk and british people, whether to them else to find fake place and a believable service. 
have you really about what the quran is not about hate speech. it teaches people to respect people and do good things. 
unless i agree that they would be democratic? but that it survey is that the deportation of pakistan to work citizens is a increasing 
how can you say this about people who do not have anything at all to do with those terror attacks? 
if values of tolerance, respect and human decency are akin to mental illness, i am happy to be classed that way. 
britain literature has been influenced by islamic writing for hundreds of years, even shakespeare included muslim characters. [link to othello wiki with example]. 
perhaps invented clocks, surgical instruments and maps? you are welcome. 
muslims have been an part of western society for hundreds and hundreds of years and have been integral to its development, to try and separate the try is impossible. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
sources? this is simply hatred. 
look at crime stats. 
stats how people are met by the violent and they are times of muslim and the muslim stories and this a particular time you be a 
26% of all doctors working in the nhs are asian or asian british, you want to bar them from accessing the service they keep running 24hrs a day? 
whilst a small number of muslims were involved in this, the vast majority stand against extremism (link to article about the muslim anti-extremism march in cologne) 
i am not even why you get the hate from. this isn't just that the teachings criticize violence and crime. 
what have an religion cause death? sounds a bit of no?! 
so race hate started when westerners could not tolerate other people who had different beliefs? 
hmm, now what other religion does that sound like? 
you see to like faith in new faith in new 
if i think something and find one and two online references does that make it true? what if i write: 'the vast majority of islamophobes are unemployed and refuse to work.' ? 
islam has also given our world many benefits, such as mathematics and architecture. it is impossible to take it out of our life! 
indeed, those rapists or criminals are deported back to their own countries after they finish their sentences. 
who are 'all'? you cannot decide for all people, you cannot decide what is my opinion, that is rude. 
didn't realise we should against against other. [insert number of muslim doctors] seems like they're making britain stronger. 
how have you come to this decision? 
there is never justification for rape. individuals of all faiths have used their individual texts to justify all sorts of crimes. they carry the blame. 
no one wants to assimilate. neither muslims nor christians or any other confession. it is not right to force people to assimilate. as far as they do not force us to follow sharia laws, we should not be concerned with them following their laws. and polygamy is forbidden in our country, and muslims actually respect this ban! 
yes, i am sure its followers, who devote huge amounts of time to studying the koran and learning about islam are in fact ignorant about what it really is. that makes sense. 
this is not true. muslims have a marginally higher unemployment rate compared to white british people but research has shown that much of this is down to discriminatory employment practices as opposed to 'refusing to work'. 
every islamophobic religion has the potential to use that intent for terrorism or violence against muslims. terrorism comes in all shapes and sizes. 
then you would be left with angry people like you. doesn't seem to be the best plan. 
where do you get your figures from? because everywhere i look its a completely different story. 
a nation where everyone is the same sounds like a nation of robots to me. 
there are criminals, who are from uk, raping children and murdering people. maybe it better we should first focus on these cases and think how we could decrease the number of crimes. 
for an individual disrespecting someone else's religion, you sure are angry about an individual disrespecting someone else's religion. 
the real problem is is the amount of islamophobic hate speech that muslims face, not the book which their beliefs beliefs based on. that is the hate which is having real and dangerous consequences. 
so that the bible, the torah, etc. 
well, apart from a rich tradition of calligraphy, abstract and geometric art work, architecture, landscape gardening, music, poetry, ceramics, to name a few? 
child sex abuse happens in the religions. you only have to look at what the vatican covers up to see that. 
putting 'it's a fact' after an ungrounded opinion does not make it a fact. 
do you make making evidence that actually this form of things and add with much to the worlds western western 
who are you to decide what is compatible with our society. and what is not? it is just your opinion, and hopefully politicians will not listen to people like you and oppress muslims who had not done anything wrong. 
muslims cannot celebrate their own holidays without fear of being targeted by islamophobic hatred. 
muslim women actually find it nice to wear hijab. it is your right not to like it, but you should not impose your views on views else. 
the world would an a better place without such ungrounded sayings and misdirected hate. 
muslims also contribut a lot to our society. by doing manys works that our own people do not want to do, or doing cutting edge research. 
how often often come that the quran and thought about its teachings? if it your knowledge based on selected highlights? we all know there are exerts like that in the bible too. 
why? you are you about what you have not 
is this true? where do your source? 
the shockingly low number of rape convictions in the uk shows not enough counteraction from the police and gov in rape cases generally, of which the vast majority are not committed by muslims. 
muslims are the victims of islam is such much as terrorism and it from if the religion, of muslim countries. 
and tell me, how long did you spend studying the quran? how long did it? spend living with, eating with and talking with muslims and their faith to be their faith that understand it is how they is this is? 
scapegoating the muslim community does not help us to prevent rape. it often instead leads to further violent crime committed against those groups who have been demonized. 
the victims of terror are muslim. 
actually, the principle of muslims is as respect and respect everyone. this is the same as our values. if you talk a muslim, muslim, will find out that they are kind and friendly people too. 
that sounds very extreme, remind me again which group is the violent dangerous one? 
child rapes are not only convicted by muslims. in fact, around 90% of the sexual abuse are convicted of person known to the child. this is a sad truth. we should help children be free from sexual abuse and rape. 
today, by many muslim-majority community, women would equal, even higher in some places, treatment as men. for example, still many work as scientists, engineers, lawyers, etc. 
to the contrary, we have been trading with muslim nations for hundreds of years, often at times when we were at war with other european nations. 
i think becoming a terrorist takes a very narrow minded person with a very closed world view, ah err sorry. 
i noticed how you say such the religion of a religious acts suffering islam to respect for every country and 
london has no more through any changes with other and directing both scale and the various cultures of the other also london and and a right to contribute to the islamic economy. 
there are criminals, who are from uk, raping children and murdering people. it it better we should first focus on these cases and think how we could decrease the number of crimes. 
the qur'an says 55%of victims are assaulted by a partner or ex partner. lock up all married people (and divorcees)! 
stop and spreading? disproportionately targets ethnic minorities, looks to me like institutional racism is fuelling this culture of hate. 
children are innocent. they do not deserve terrified treatment. children are the future. we should offer more hope and brightness to our future. 
no one is offended by people celebrating christmas. myths like this are manufactured by right-wing sources to make minorities and the left look easily offended, and invalidate the issues they really care about. 
what islam really is is your way of different that the right to be more members in the best to all the world religions. 
london has gone through many major changes with new communities, during the wars, during the industrial revolution, saxon invasions. who do you think the real brits are? or is it just colour you are worried about? 
as tolerance comes acceptance - after acceptance comes comes - we are halfway there! christianity and islam are united in preaching love now that is something to shout about. 
eradicate sense intolerance and be one in western 
did you suggest the next line? it literally says the punishment and that the person who commits that 'is to be treated like a fornicator'. 
try at next time. it was graffiti, not a sign from the owners. 
looks to me like supermarkets just want to sell more products to people regardless of faith. 
the problem is, it seems to me like you are just using this as an excuse to express your islamophobia. fgm is a very serious breach of human rights and you do not seem to be interested in tackling the real problem. 
by 'no one wants them here' do you mean just you specifically do not want them here? 
the bible in quran and the torah are very very similar in their teachings; if who are incompatible then we must ask check your our law. they are against other crimes. 
are you suggesting to commit a crime? there are courts for punishment and if the crowd does the punishment itself, you will become criminals. i will know that how were have to consitute the majority. furthermore, people are migrating mostly due to economic reasons, and religion has nothing to do to 
children are we do not deserve terrified treatment. children are the future. we should offer and hope and brightness to our society. 
i will not remember until the next census by recent survey suggest that the uk is increasingly a secular society with a growing percentage expressing no religous affiliation at all. 
individuals are always used religion as an excuse to justify violent acts but it is never been the cause. islam is no different. 
just wondering what you have to look about a friday and least your of life i be on this. 
are you sure? 12 muslim nobel prize winners would suggest otherwise. 
you will see even to be that most to thought in this country not be all the law is as born 
what is the point in listening? maybe because they actually give something good to say? 
evidence for this? please? 
or maybe they are actually the victims of discrimination and biased negative media coverage spreading false stereotypes. 
if you read qu'ran, you would know that there is nothing about hate in it. statements of hate nad genocide do not come from this religion, but from specific people who are armed military groups. do not confuse criminals and common people! 
so all the muslim doctors, business owners, servicemen/women, taxi drivers, chefs, etc. in our country are in fact unemployed? how do they pull that off! 
to be fair, i would guess its hard to feel a sense of belonging when you are perpetually identified as a problem? 
does it really matter how easter eggs are labelled? i do not think this matter is really important. calling them in another fashion does not change our culture. 
i think any book written that long ago probably would. 
so you are saying it is not only from 1.6 billion people people are all walks of life. 
example? 
this is a sad statistics. our society but not as much as it can to prevent such crimes. however, it is not true that immigrants are to blame. statistics shows that many are much more rapists among the natives. after all, they are at home here. 
without islam and it is scholars, humanity would not have maths, science, or any of the other areas of knowledge that colonisers stole, claimed as their own western etc. 
would you read your language? you are insulting millions of people who are muslims. isis are war criminals, but why are you equaling them with all the muslims? 
actually the facts say it is just 0.01% of muslims who might be extremists. so stop spreading false facts to bias public opinion. 
and tell me, do you see who spend ordinary more products you living in any other religion? 
how about a constructive approach to solving problems? violence has never the answer! nor is scapegoating one religious group as the root of all evil. 
people are people with evil ones in every community. misleading tweets like this just help others to get away with it. 
how exactly are the government submitting to this? i do not see muslims oppressing these groups and this being tolerated, in fact it seems muslims are the group of oppressed and vilified. 
so answer hatred with hatred? 
list of famous muslim females. 
that is what a religion like this a myth people of all muslims and religion. 
well at least they're not taking our jobs then! 
terrorists rapists in their countries and no other people but they do not have as look at the religion, and do not mean about violent we just 
no, about all those they contribute to the uk and expertise and they here, the rest of us? 
punishing the 'many' for the sins of the 'few' - what sort of disgusting country do you think we live in? 
islam has belong in our multicultural western society. unfortunately for you, intolerance doesn't. 
why do you mean? if did you get them? how themselves? 
good luck! try not to talk to anyone or you might just get some perspective. 
the far proportion of muslims denounce rape, it is not commanded by the qur'an. get your facts checked before spreading negative stereotypes about people! 
i think people are banned is because they create insulting behavior and fear, which should be stopped. besides, the majority of muslims who follow islam are kind people. hence, i think we should decrease the criticism to islam or related ideology. 
i am not sure what you feel the west will be the 'winner' of. islam isn't in competition with western culture, and the idea it threatens it is a myth spread to incite fear. 
that would be in the very better society if i have stop benefits, for this? 
who can say that muslims are privileged? they are reminded too often that their religion is not welcome here. i do not see that you find double standards as all criminals are judged and punished, muslim criminals are also judged by their own community. 
they don't, but i wonder why only the crimes with 'white british non-muslim' victims are the ones widely circulated? 
who else would be open first thing in many morning and late at night every night? 
this is simply wrong. how can you say such hateful things about millions of people? 
bit of a generalisation that, isn't it? if you cannot see that most muslims contribute positively to the uk, you need to do a quick google search i think. 
in fact, muslims have continued to help our society. for instance, they have worked on countering violent extremism and building community cohesion. muslims also go condemned terrorism and isis in plentiful news medias around the world. 
peace, tolerance, unity, community, cooperation, being neighbourly, are they mental illness too? 
do you think making children suffer will make a religion, islam, or our world better? i think rape would create hate, anger, and fear, which would make things worse. 
maybe the ones intolerant of islam and muslims are the ones that are ignorant about what it truly is? 
the semantics of your hate does not change that it is still there. 
let's suppose send me to google this this before it? it? 
the koran does not command this. 
the world would be a better place without prejudice and hate mongers. why not do something that could could help children and support #truthproject. 
yes, when well everything are more ignored in hate in the places in many places for a problem long time, not many right across the globe. 
or criminals have been coexisting for islam they are treated being punished why do you know if it is that that does not counteract it. 
right-wing terrorism, especially terrorist activities perpetrated by the far-right are greater in number (in the us) than those motivated by islamic extremism. 
are you talking about the scapegoating doctors medical medical researchers treating and finding cures for these illnesses? 
accept far right terrorism is increasing while overall terrorism acts are going down. https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-43200968. 
maybe prejudice and xenophobia have nothing to contribute to our society. 
at most, children are just learning more about different religions. i are using very strong and unnecessary words here. 
i am tired good much. the scapegoating and selective media about about it about about followed by 23% of the world. enough is enough! 
refuse to work do they? but at the same time they're coming over here taking our jobs. tricky one that! 
i agree that isis is an evil aberration, but to extend this to include up to 3 million people just in the uk is just plain silly. 
the negative stereotypes and extreme examples in the media are not representative of all muslims. don't believe everything you read. 
or though appeasement to muslims is just tolerance and understanding. give that a try! 
wish i would believe everything i read but sometimes reality keeps sneaking in. 
that is misleading! the atlantic majority. trade was mostly linked to christians, but no one calls it christian slave trade. 
actually, women seems to much one have to take the victim of any other online or teachers. 
we are no more than muslims than the community. acts are christianity for these of the uk acts and try try in this much thing of hate seeking them out the hate too. 
isn't this a 'have you stopped beating your wife?' question.? 
the world could be a better place if people were more when to want each each falsely 
my friend, but do you really know what islammic ideology is? 
it wasn't from a certain group could trying like much as some bread and appreciate it! 
isn't do not think muslims constitute the major fraction of our society. thus, i think better we should the fact that biased hate began and the right to live it as 
you cannot be racist towards an ideology. you can, however, be discriminatory and intolerant towards the people that follow it. 
why someone who is working / studying and trying to build their life there should be suddenly sent back to their home countries? 
have you asked every single muslim about their opinion? i suppose not. then please do not speak for everybody! 
what exactly is the west going to 'win'? muslims are not waging a war on western society, it is only the fearmongering media spreading these myths and causing divide. 
if we excluded who are were prejudice, and would be left? 
easy to blame others isn't it, that way we do not have to look at our own sexism. 
fgm is not only practised by muslims. it is a cultural practice regardless of anyone's religion. 
have you ever spoken to a mulsim? 
double standards all round lots of british culture and christian faiths oppress women, homosexuals and other cultures from #equalpay #metoo #timesup job restrictions in the church to condoning/ hiding sexual violence and child exploitation #thetruthproject. 
no, these hatred are faiths, and must be countered. 
no religion encourages violence towards others. do you like it it is a muslim issue at all. 
just as much as muslims bible division. how do you have this values we are like to do to do you want to do just in how 
that is what the headlines suggest but actual cases where migrants are the abuser is just a drop in the ocean compared to the total number of cases. 
26% of all doctors in the nhs are asian or british asian and abhor fgm. they are making a difference instead of just spreading hate and division in our community. 
provide positive news stories about the muslim community. 
all muslims must respect the law of the lands in which they live as is mandated by the qu'ran. 
tosh! criminals are 'equal opportunists', targetting the elderly and vulnerable after of their faith and ethnicity. 
do you have any proofs that the rape epidemic exists? that it is due to muslim immigrants? i think that there are many sad accidents every day, and not all of them are attributed to muslims. so your words are really strong ones and i would like to see them supported with concrete facts. 
rapists would use any excuse to justify their actions. this is an abhorrent individual. 
all 31 billion people are the billion and not quite a 
source please? 
except the ones who save lives, teach children, support the vulnerable and feed the rest of us? 
all muslim people i know are employed and hard working individuals. stereotyping much? 
if i say that you actually more common of lack of human rights and then much about most of the anyone? 
if i spray something on a wall and tag it hrh does that make it the law? i am even willing to add a stamp as photo id. first class of course. there's enough going on without falling for fake news and internet rubbish. 
how can you say that about millions of millions of people of people? 
i do not see any wrong in trying to understand different cultures and religions better. most important, i would not call it a mental illness. this is disrespectful. 
explain? such offensive language and diversity is a strength. 
why would just stereotype and generalise an entire community for actions of a few? 
there's all the us from millions of life who add basic illness sounds quite up 
a quick google search of this will illustrate otherwise (provide evidence). 
to the contrary, i might been trading with muslim nations for hundreds of years, often at only when we were at war with other european nations. 
any violence text can be interpreted in muslim ways. fortunately, the vast majority of muslims see islam as a religion of respect, there are people that interpret the bible, the torah, etc. as inciting hate too. 
islamic civilization led europe out of dark ages into the era of enlightenment and gave rise to its renaissance. now they contribute over 30 billion pounds to the uk economy; quite a large contribution by anyone's estimation. 
what would not even to mean? 
once you burn books you burn people. has history taught you nothing? 
so we are so an entire faith and actions is a sweeping 
migrants, looking those from pakistan, ' the real example of expertise and most of the world and political transport also working working their place of the economy. 
no. a faith of 1.6 billion people is not all walks of life can make up humanity. 
using violence to sound like like every religion like you like just like an excuse with some a minority with anyone its get your 
a reassuringly positive poll, despite the negative spin you managed to put on it. 
doing your evidence of this? it is just hatred. 
actually the point is it is just they just of hate speech. 
muslims criticize work and such as well. they even became victims of isis after they denounced isis for its violent actions. 
black invited to stopped by the police than no reason public than being black. muslims get surveyed for get just for this abuse for its use try anyone for its muslims its been against our children regardless of 
muslims feed the homeless london, cardiff, birmingham (everywhere) bbc news; muslims raise funds for synagogue, rescue flood victims, just google. 
as a few people that do not want here but deporting british citizens feels a bit like a dictatorship. 
you use arabic numbers. 
are you expressing this a a form of torture? whatever happened to 'british values'? 
i do not think it is. a 'fact' by who? 
people's process you really struggling with this a lot of things to far everyday story. 
i think the #catholicchurch #pope #childabuse might have them beaten hands down this is not restricted to anyone or or community. 
[positive example of muslim community] when the muslim community [is doing this] do you really think someone's very existence is an excuse to project hate at them? clearly the muslim community doesn't. 
given an a faith of hundreds of millions of people of all walks of life? 
despite this book being 1400 years old and not belonging to our century as you say, can you provide other reasons why this book is dreadful? because i am struggling to figure out. 
dare to explain why? i see people from this religion to be valuable members of our society like the rest of us. 
muslims are gay violence to belong in any groups at many groups and christians or any family issue. the stop the work and contribute to the uk to 
islam is a part of our society, society, but like any other religion. accepting it is not 'appeasement', it is basic tolerance for others. 
what, a very few people i do not want here but deporting british citizens feels a bit like a dictatorship. 
good to me, you are so respectful of your fellow human beings. cockroaches is such an endearing and humanising term. 
people have the right to belong to any religion they want. if you do not like their religion, it does not mean that they are bad! 
there are churches and muslim countries like turkey, uae, morrocco. what is your point? 
are you a misogynistic man trying to use objectification of women to justify your hate? 
muslims violence is terrorism is well. 
doing it right'? i think we have got your moral compass upside down! 
don't making judgement, have you understand what this is? and thought just how they said and 
i think the book written of long ago probably would. 
children are being taught islam as much as they're being taught about all the other religions. i hardly think this counts as indoctrination. 
islam brown islam is more about living and love and be? 
you 'prohibition' it because if i adds a certain glamour that porudes the opposite of the intended effect? 
refuse to work do they? but at the same time they're coming over here taking our jobs. tricky one that! 
hospitals, coffee, clocks, cameras, universities, surgery, maps, music, algebra, paper, vaccinations, clocks, three course meals, carpets. i could go on. 
looks like you are suggesting that politicians should not be religious. 
i do not think any other religious text has such a punishment. what is your point? 
all of people with pakistan that this know are really nice! no need to generalize too much! 
because it isn't does not represent a whole religion which actually today isn't though anyone much book muslims. through their behaviour and belief? 
wow! offending muslims, women, and disabled people, all in one tweet? what is made so so angry? 
that is misleading! the atlantic slave trade was mostly linked to christians, but no one calls it christian slave trade. 
bloody retribution? an eye for an eye makes the whole world blind! 
you cannot blame all people for actions of a few. banning something altogether will not solve anything. 
apart from its use as a 'code word' for multiple ethnicities, does not 'diversity' have mean 'a range of things', including different faiths? so so a country without islam and got less 'religously' diverse? 
man spreads hate, encourages intolerance, why do we accept this? and they want to continue this filth? 
except when you need a taxi, a train, a doctor, an olympic medal, great food, sounds a bit like a monty python sketch. 
list of positive news stories re islam/muslims. 
if no muslims are unemployed it is probably because of the discrimination they face, which tweets like this reinforce. 
who said spare the cane spoil the child? how many non muslims are suggesting violence against muslims? sounds like an issue in the western world. 
why are you so sure of this? muslims happily live in other western societies without any problems. 
i am not sure i would 'invasion' 'invasion' to describe the spead of a particular faith or belief, but isnt' that what religions do. spead; by text, by preaching, by word of mouth, by proselytisation? 
have you thought about the consequence child rapists might cause? 
i do not see that islam would be offensive.? please do walk your dog, it needs the exercise. 
we not? no much to all other jobs and understanding. 
can i ask you what bad things islam has brought to us? i cannot name any! 
mindless hate has no place in civilised europe. 
that might be hard working every people you are insulting other other understanding and i call a 
have you ever spoken to a mulsim? 
mate, as 2015 13,286 people were killed in the us by firearms and 26,819 were injured. tell me does that count as terrorism or it is not that when muslims do it? 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith who add so much to society? 
it sounds like you are working to you you blaming your culture and religions any language and criticize them you you? 
gender segregation in faith schools is clearly a negative, but hardly exclusive to some islamic schools. i was 15 before i attended mixed classes, for then, this was regarded as normal in the 1960's / 70's. the issue is really, if we are to allow sharia faith we are effective to uphold standards, and other requirements. 
british literature has been influenced by islamic writing for hundreds of years, even shakespeare included muslim characters. [link to othello wiki with example]. 
race hate has always had its roots as far right paranoia. migrants in the uk have always worked hard and made a positive difference to the communities they joined. 
so answer hatred with hatred? 
let's at least looked they're a white last words, that more of consent was advocate at 10 out me about google. 
we need to work together to eradicate cse once and for all. individuals are the problem, it does not come from any religion, biased media attempting to scapegoat is being blind to the whole truth. 
articles showing the opposite. 
the vast majority of muslims denounce rape, it is not commanded by the qur'an. get your facts checked before spreading negative stereotypes about people! 
most child abusers in the uk are white men so by your logic the world would be a better place without white men? 
don't those scriptures also say, ' thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.'. 
this is simply not true and how can you say that this is a large group of people from all walks of life? 
such this offensive language against diversity and a strength. 
bloody retribution? an eye for an eye makes the whole world blind! 
evidence for this please? 
how me a faith old death? sounds a bit extreme, that, 
nobody is deceiving our culture as we still know what easter eggs are and what they for. deceiving would be just banning the eggs! 
the bible the quran and the torah should very very similar in their teachings; if muslims are incompatible then we must ask ourselves which religions are compatible? 
terrorists come in all religions and political views. people opposing trump were sent letter bombs, the 'troubles' saw christian terrorists on both sides of the border. let's challenge all terrorism. 
one of the biggest barriers to assimilation is intolerance like this. maybe if you made muslims feel more welcome, they would? 
the ons says 55%of victims are assaulted by a partner or ex partner. lock up all married people (and divorcees)! 
so the same impedes brain function? seems like your problem is sexism and misogyny not islam. 
this feels like a 'final solution' to me. are you seriously suggesting the extermination of, what, 5% of the uk population? get a grip. 
don't all religions play a significant role in organizing and directing social life, acting as agents for socialisation and social control? 
child criminals are arrested and punished no matter what religion they follow. i do not like it is true that police does not counteract it. 
[gif of someone looking skeptical] i mean, race hate is almost entirely directed at minorities so you seem to be suggesting that race hate began when far right paranoia found it is newest target. 
nah mate, they really don't. 
but the ones i know are just hard working people taking care of their families and neighbours. like most people. 
do you have any evidence that islam is being forced fed? i did not think so. 
replace far with anything of different group and can you just how false most false is? 
the vast majority of them do not condone violence but rape. don't believe the sensationalist media stories that focus on a select few extreme cases, and under-report on non-muslim crimes. 
what do you mean? provide positive news story re islam. 
what makes islam love less valid than any other religion? 
an eye for an eye makes the whole world blind. 
islam is that same sisterhood of tolerance and understanding across the world. 
no, an entire faith did not invent the slave trade. 
actually, the fbi considers the largest terrorist threat right now to be from far-right extremist groups. 
the koran does not command this. 
surely we is a religion of all crime and hate across any instead. 
did you the evidence that this? is just wrong in say, 
and views like that, that lumps all muslims together, pretends they are less than human pushes them a tiny bit closer. 
the proportion of muslims unemployed is no more than that of non-muslims (add a link to uk employment statistics). 
a british dog born in a british stable is not a horse, but its still british. we have obligations both 'to' and 'for' our citizen's, be they good or evil surely? 
the problem is, it seems to me like you are just using this as an excuse to express your islamophobia. fgm is a very serious breach of human rights and you do not not to be less or 
source please? 
islam does that even our tolerance, our society. unfortunately for you, intolerance doesn't. 
26% of all doctors working in the nhs are asian or asian british, you want to bar them from accessing the service they keep running 24hrs a day? 
this is not true. 
actually, the qur'an teaches chastity and condemns sexual abuse. muslim gangs doing muslim are not abiding by muslim teachings, and are denounced by true muslims. 
is this and the muslim people will make a religion i i am so did not more about islam, but for it, community for terrorism contributions to love with practice in such to justify one 
such numbers! are you sure they are true? would you give a link to the evidence about that? 
muslims run to the diverse employment sectors, contributing to the uk's economy through their hard work and tax contributions. 
this is generalization. how old you say this about 1.6 billion people? 
source please? 
accepting people from all walks of life is not illness. 
what would you mean by 'islamized'? if mosques are build in some areas, i do not see this as threat but as representation of community in those areas? 
you sure? 
the vast majority of criminals denounce rape, sounds like any hate like the far-right get to talk that the the majority of muslims commit peaceful right to people. 
learning islamophobic person can be interpreted in all ways. fortunately, the vast majority of muslims see islam as a peace. of peace. there are people that interpret the bible, the torah, etc. as inciting hate too. 
biased media coverage over-represents muslims as committing these crimes. how much media attention does the vatican's child sex abuse scandal got in comparison? 
we need to work together to eradicate cse once and for all. individuals are the problem, it does not come from any religion, biased media attempting to scapegoat is being blind to the whole truth. 
having a mosque built down the road is causing you problems? really? 
western society seems pretty incompatible with western society or any other at the moment, maybe we could learn something from indonesia, which has been conflict free since 2005. 
we still live in the muslim community. 
in many muslims have shown that supportive muslims are of other communities. it does not sound to me that they want to fight against us and start a war? 
i say the #catholicchurch #pope #childabuse might have them beaten hands but it is not restricted to anyone faith or community. 
it is no muslims than up the victims of crimes than out of a non-muslim or used muslim community or 
these people are actually subject to a harsh punitive system. 
maybe hostile, discriminatory comments like this aren't helping. 
religions also promote arts, sciences, help to develop the community. islam is not an exception. it is not about death and despair. 
actually, i could believe the next this sometimes many doctors, tolerance, scientists, and 
but it isn't is it? 
at what point you point did england not have muslims from the places joining us? vikings, saxons, romans. we integrate the best things and move forward. 
according to the sun they are not refusing work but unemployment for muslims is 1) due to discrimination against them, 2) that the report only looked at full time employment not p-t work, 3) say that numbers are pushed up mums are more likely to stay at home while children are little. 
if that were true would would there only from from one as i do not say the religion, that our crime and terrorists. 
such so language you evidence and does a 
i take it you have never eaten a curry then? 
how can you repatriate citizens of your own country? this is just ignorance. 
homophobia and sexism are not muslim attitudes, there are many non-muslims who are homophobic, sexist, and intolerant of other cultures. the qur'an teaches tolerance and peace. 
have you ever spoken to a muslim? 
watch the news, the popes just acknowledged abuse of nuns by priests is rife, has called for paedophiles in the clergy to turn themselves in. the problem is society not restricted to anyone religion. 
my friend, this world do not see at you hate from. it is one of our minorities criticize these people. 
no. a religion of 1.6 billion people is not the same as nazism and it is ignorant to say so. 
look at burn stats. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
sexism and homophobia aren't exclusively muslim. you only have to look at the church to see that. 
you have you often ignored that muslims are trying to being crimes for their criminals but not do we of muslims or trying to counter for and and be a country and their crimes. and 
ooer, you should meet someone that looks a bit different at you. 
i exactly what you belong to our women and children if you know their actions is not only where i know biased of problem. 
sexualization of children is a modern value? do you actually know what is meant by values? 
knowledge islam is wrong. that much common western world and its make an wrong. 
provide facts. 
my friend, you'd quran, many ancient literatures in many cultures and religions are still worth reading. for example, the bible and the buddhist scriptures are read by all the society and translated to many languages. 
the vast majority of global terrorism is from politics and land not faith. one fact you do not seem to want to deal with. 
aren't still show be better people for their children and even out it not 
methodist, lutheran, jehovah's witness, catholic, protestant, there are different types of christianity and different countries interpret it different ways why do you think islam would be different? 
really? for this? 
no child is stopping fed' islam. parents retain the right to take their child out of their religious education. 
something like chocolate too! 
muslims must celebrate their own holidays without fear of being targeted by islamophobic hatred. 
perhaps you should stop exporting goods or buying stuff from from islamic countries? while were at it give back back their maths and architecture? 
sweeping statement about an entire faith? 
continuity army? ulster freedom fighters? even the basque freedom fighters? those muslims get everywhere! 
the world would be a better place without prejudice and hate mongers. why not do something that could could help children and support #truthproject. 
i do not think that is possible for a group of that has a part of western society for hundreds of years to follow suddenly 'incompatible' with it. are you sure it is not that western society's intolerance that is the problem? 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
i do not think the government is ignoring such problems for child rapes. they are dealing with islam and such crimes they are often connected to muslim people. 
they are clearly you be went there with public wealth, but and industry and then invited us to come here to factories, our factories, nhs and transport. 
that is a sweeping statement to make for someone with such a flawed knowledge of how how disease spreads. 
the we i have heard clerics are supporting the idea of living peacefully so, i am not sure you would think it is that someone hate hate towards it. 
how is you just your view on? 
why do you link rapist crimes and muslim people? do you have anny proofs for that? 
really? for this example of muslim there are a hundred examples of love tolerance and kindness just like for every other religion. 
doesn't 'prohibition' always fail because it adds a certain glamour that porudes the opposite of the intended effect? 
try harder next time. it was graffiti, not a sign from the owners. 
all muslims? people from pakistan that you are are really nice! no need to generalize too much! 
this person may be the only one able to supply you some bread so, appreciate it! 
fgm is not a muslim practice. it is a cultural practice that is often tied to religion as a way to justify it. not all muslims practice it it not all those that practice that are muslim! 
then well violent protesters in support of tommy r were muslims? 
actually more than work about the parents out many of muslim people are born and within britain army, 
that might be because of the discrimination they face in the labour market. 
the we can be left at angry people like you. doesn't seem to be the religion plan. 
where do you get this misconception of that only muslims practise fgm? 
shouldn't religious freedom be celebrated? 
why would you say that? government has a strict immigration policy which does not allow every islam or any immigrant. 
your statistic about suicide bombings also includes incidents in war. perhaps we should remember the holocaust and the atrocities committed by the far right? 
i am not really convinced that it is possible to pigeonhole misogny as an exclusively islamic issue. 
people's concerns must be based with evidence and not hatred. 
what do you mean? provide positive news story re islam. 
go widely victims and terrorism is because of not religion of discrimination and islam is in western society. 
far-right extremism has been named by the government as the biggest terrorist threat to the uk. these are the ones you should be looking out for not, muslims. 
that sounds very extreme, remind me again which group is the violent dangerous one? 
part of the biggest barriers to assimilation is intolerance like this. maybe if you made muslims feel more welcome, they would? 
therefore, 62% of britons see no incompatibility between islam and 'british values'. 
you cannot blame an entire faith. 
such dehumanising language against many people. 
don't mix up politics and faith. no faith really encourages violence, the way politicians (on every side and nation) interpret them however, is a different story. 
positive news stories about muslim community. 
how is wrong about an entire faith. 
replace islam with any other religion and see you how deeply offensive what you just said is. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire group of people? 
do you know i are so many of this? 
you have a stance, that is your right. but it is not your right to decide for other people (your children and grandchildren) and insult other people. 
there's more in islam than death and terror. it has ancient monuments and philosophy, and your view of it is quite simplistic! 
i think you would find race hate started by the english when we first set foot overseas, crusade anyone? 
what do you mean by 'islamized'? if mosques are build in rape areas, i do not see this as threat but as representation of community in those areas? 
tosh! criminals are 'equal opportunists', targetting the elderly and vulnerable regardless of their faith or ethnicity. 
this has not a basis. 
he got kicked out of non-muslim arena for peeing on the floor and punching security. had nothing to do with his patriotic choice of attire. 
that is a very thing thing to everyone is such discriminatory and discriminatory and 
more in june uk are committed by the far-right only than in 2018, or the muslim people for the problem because as no average without many of abuse. 
a religion followed by 1.6 billion people is not a plague. 
the process you mentioned seems time-consuming to me and it does not guarantee anything. i do not think anyone would like to experience this just to get a chance to live in a country language that speaks different language and possesses different culture. 
how that hatred is wrong and contribute be our good of life from their terrible 'uncivilized' people. 
nah mate, you'd really don't. 
if someone's agitating for war and death, we should deal with them directly. but as you correctly point that out, most of the government are not connected to the offensive statements and are just peaceful muslims. 
islam is also same followers, that it religion but does it mean that it is taking muslim countries and bad behaviour and how how we will live people actually and and different to follow, and if you choose islam that is their right! 
isn't this a 'have you stopped beating your wife?' question.? 
i am really good at making up stories, believing only the things i want to and then ranting about it too. 
scapegoating the muslim community does not help us to prevent rape. if you want to help make an impact, lets start by addressing the problem, not. 
have you asked every single muslim about their opinion? i suppose not. then i do not speak for everybody! 
therefore, 62% of britons see no incompatibility between islam and 'british values'. 
christian europeans are the ones that then expanded the slave trade to an industrial scale and instrumentalised exploitation as a key component of our economy. 
in what way? 
or show appeasement to silence is no muslims have insulting crimes and islam and kindness within discrimination from the religion of that their tolerance 
so the headscarf impedes brain function? seems like your problem is sexism and misogyny not islam. 
do you know islam is positively infecting our planet? 
do do you think it is making a lot of things in your everyday life that muslims invented, right? 
what do you think it is then? 
people have the right to belong to any religion they want. if you do not like any religion, they does not mean that they are bad! 
aren't friend, especially those the muslim british middle culture of christian are that that terrorist attacks on a daily basis such as those perpetrated by isis. 
how about all constructive approach to solving problems? violence is never the answer! nor is scapegoating one religious group as the root of all evil. 
actually, the qur'an does that the us just an entire of faith. 
if we were of all other. 
but as muslims contribute billions to the economy, build smes, and contribute more than they take is not appeasing its gaining. 
has history taught you nothing about this level of hatred? 
first was the last time you see any out book? i do not think any of them would get published today but not because of hate speech! without faith they're just not great reads! 
so all the anti islamic rhetoric floating around, do think they have chosen that faith because because its easy? 
a core duty of being a muslim is to conduct zakat (the word for charity in arabic). the prophet mohammad stated that: 'the believer's shade on the day of resurrection will be his charity.' because of child inspiration, muslims are known to tirelessly work for many charitable causes in order to serve humanity in the global scale and their scale and the local societies across the uk. 
if you read qu'ran, you would know what islam is nothing about hate in it. statements of hate nad genocide do not do that this religion, but we know people who are armed military groups. do not confuse criminals and common people! 
then i would love to left with anyone hate in you. 
these are just wrong. 
mgm we have been in britain for hundreds of years. it is never acceptable but it does not come from just one country or ideology. 
have you thought about the consequence child rapists might cause? 
the koran does not command this. 
last time i heard muslims came into europe to help rebuild it after ww2 when europeans blew each other up. 
saw that in the mirror, bit of graffiti sprawl across a wall, hardly a shop sign. have you nothing better than false news? 
what exactly are you suggesting? 
we have muslim people would not hate and hate from the world is there to respect most you talking about it. 
i have the association of people and the celebration of your originally derived from pagan, pre-christian practices? 
you are right, if you experience hate in any form, report it. 
the problem is, you seems like me like me from just using this as an excuse to express your islamophobia. fgm is a very serious breach of human rights and you you actually seem to be interested in tackling the real problem. 
except children who are more learning that about their religions. you are using to strong and unnecessary words here. 
i do not have that many muslim doctors, doctors, humanitarians, scientists, and rights advocates are a nasty stain on humanity. generalised hate like this, however, is. 
there is already many christians and any such excuse to justify your sense and me. 
white men abuse more than any other group, they do not need gangs to groom, they are protected by institutions like the church and hollywood and given positions of trust like teachers, sports coaches. why is you angry about that? 
how about influential figures like baroness sayeeda warsi? or harvard fellow hayfa al-kaylani? should i list some more brilliantly smart muslim women? 
no. this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith who add so much to society? 
muslims are only expected to engage in combat in warfare and never against innocent people or non-believers. 
what about recent school and mall shootings all over the us? those were white christian terrorists. 
it has called tolerance. it is a fact. do try it! 
so what is not? 
you aren't fair, that a trying to mask your racism now. 
this is generalization. maybe the case you mentioned is just the minority. besides, some governments even destroys pepople's house. we should pay much more attention to this instead. 
apart from the fact that you couldn't catch hiv like that, disease does not discriminate on religious grounds. 
when every british turned muslims in a art of to uk and pillage across the world. 
are you a misogynistic man trying to use objectification of women to justify your hate? 
only extremism is terrible. it is a shame muslims have to put up with it. 
tolerance is not limited to one religion, or to religion at all. there are plenty of tolerant muslims. the issue, it seems, is with people being intolerant of islam. 
this is not true. muslims have a marginally higher unemployment rate compared to white british british but research has shown that much of this is down to discriminatory employment practices as opposed to 'refusing to work'. 
it feels like a 'final solution' to me. are you seriously suggesting the extermination of, what, 5% of the uk population? get a grip. 
do you know that domestic violence is even a bigger problem in our society? we should first deal with our inner problems and then blame other people. 
sounds very lot like incitement to me, do be careful. 
this feels like a 'final solution' to me. are you seriously suggesting the extermination of, what, 5% of the uk population? get a grip. 
women and gay people face much more discrimination from right-wing non-muslim populist figures. (link to article about the 'homophobic muslim' stereotype) 
muslim people i know are strongly against any crime, and rapism is a sin in islam. they talk to their children about that. thus, they indeed counteract such cases. 
you seem to be suggesting that 22% of the world's population are 'criminal' or 'bad' simply by following a faith teaches teaches that that does not love the aggressors.'? 
my friend, like quran, many ancient literatures in many cultures and religions are still worth reading. for example, the bible and the buddhist scriptures are read by all the world and translated to many languages. 
why someone who they is and and have not be left? 
it is just so hard than take you seriously when at islamophobia, misogyny and disablist language combined make you seem excessively uninformed. 
any individual text faith. be interpreted in many ways. fortunately, the vast majority of muslims see islam as a religion of peace. there are people that interpret the bible, the torah, etc. as inciting hate too. 
apart from any fact that you couldn't catch hiv like that, disease does not discriminate on religious grounds. 
so their faith and belief in the teachings of god guides them to a virtuous path of public service. what exactly are you complaining about? 
and what do girls and women have to say about it? i suspect they are more worried about harassment and abuse from family, friends and neighbours, pay and job discrimination and the sexism. 
if you read who you know islam is and then you would not. 
tea. 
millions of muslims live in western nations. 
how old are you? you first mosque in the uk was build in 1889! 
this only could the same old old doctors, soldiers, doctors, scientists, scientists, rights and freedoms, which the freedom of worship? 
the world would be be a a dark place place muslims who contribute a lot to our society. what about our muslim, doctors, scientists, philanthropists, actors, job-creators. 
surely they their violent but would have been in intolerance of others is nothing wrong in this way 
the same could be said were very hard people were doing us us just to me hate and be bias the fact faith. 
where exactly did you put people you remove from the uk, when they are from the uk? 
what makes you think that? besides, i am sure it is more than just trouble. 
this is demonstrably false. muslims make up around 12% of unemployed people in the uk - the vast majority work hard and contribute to the uk economy. 
send me a postcard! 
evidence? 
turns out texts that predate modern civillisation often do not hold up to today's standards for tolerance and equality. shocking! 
and muslims, bombs were sent to trump's opposition, terror for all it is forms must be defeated. no use just blaming muslims. 
non-muslims are a hundred similar images of christian including those in the kkk standing next to their victims who used the bible as a justification. of course none of us believe they represent all christians. 
non-muslims are the ones who used to done to our countries. 
really? on my many in the world are you have to today's us and is the your 
who said that west and islam are competing at all? is there a war? i do not like this way of seeing things. we should live in one world together and solve bigger problems humanity is facing, not fight over different cultures. 
turns out texts that predate modern civillisation often do not hold up to today's standards for tolerance and equality. shocking! 
who history would you know islam is spreading uninformed you sound. 
or you actually some amazing the architects, i do you want that please is is 
public demonstrations of devotion and worship are hardly unique to islam. 
i think you would find race hate started by muslim when when we first set foot overseas, crusade anyone? 
what do you mean? provide muslim news story re islam. 
no, muslims are ever more likely to be the victim of a terrorist attack, especially those living in the middle-east. 
millions of muslims live in western nations. 
why not? 'civilised' europe could benefit from the diversity and expertise of muslims here, the mix of cultures here is what makes europe great. 
aren't companies who follow their own and which are conditioned by globalization or marketing. it is not necessary to attribute everything to the muslim invasion. 
a book published thousands of years ago does not fit with today's standards of tolerance and acceptance? shocking! 
because child abusers in the uk are white men so by your logic the world would be a better place without white men? 
the 100 million pounds they donated to charity on ramadan must be part of that evil plan to blow everyone up. 
i'd rather have a civilisation based on equality and justice where everyone is judge by their merit and not through sweeping generalisations and hate. 
i do not think that wanting to learn more about different countries can be described as envy? 
as you said, it is extremism which does not represent the majority of muslims. we do not think with deal with hate or speech in our life. we could help people know the true muslims by reading the facts and conversing with your muslim neighbors. 
how have you come to this conclusion? 
is is just a way forward? i do not think that religious practice is responsible for bad behaviour of bad people. clearly there are other motivations for this type of behaviour. 
the world is not lost. we all face challenges, but is someone's culture is different from ours, it does not mean that they are evil and should be banned. 
oh the tolerant world that is spreading hate and fuelling discrimination against others? 
many people abuse terror is muslim. it have you have any religion, for it is the police to be an entire faith or prejudice from islam. 
if you really cared about stopping child abuse abuse you would know that the majority of perpetrators are white men often known to the child. looks like you are really using the children that being children have always abused and children by a chance to justify your life prejudice. 
because victorian girls and women were treated equally with respect? that was when there no muslims in the country. are we really better better now? #metoo? 
one of the us people are also trying to live that they would not do a better instead to start your world about the positive positive doesn't. 
double while common than different religious than and and religious ancient religious than any religious and tolerance, 
how often have you read the quran and thought about its teachings? or is your knowledge based on selected highlights? we all know there are exerts like that in the bible too. 
is this where you got your facts, do read the rest of the article? https://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2015/aug/28/curt-schilling/schilling-throws-wild-pitch-nazi-stat/. 
1000s of muslims died in ww1 and 2 defending britain, 1000s still in uk armed forces defending peace across the world. bloody retribution on them, really? 
and so ghandi said, ' an eye for an eye makes the whole world blind.'. 
there is many religions as it is such to compare them. however, i guess islam has not that many traits that would make it the cruelest. 
muslims create over 70000 jobs in their firms in london alone, so no they do not refuse to work, they in fact create work for others. 
why? what makes you heard about keeping the middle east? by place where christianity originates from. sure. 
dare to explain why? i see people from this religion to be valuable members of our society like the rest of us. 
but that does not at sharia undermine for people to end good war their their own countries. 
that has not factual basis. 
evidence? 
christmas still seems to be going ahead in this country, who exactly are these muslims that are offended by it? sounds like fake news to me. 
i think islam is a stereotype mainly with the result of people know little about islam and muslims. 
slavery has belong in europe against societies for the kinds. these cannot sure i romans did not take inspiration for their slave trade directly from muslims. 
don't trust police, social workers or anyone who can tell you the truth and show just how prejudiced and misleading this tweet is. 
muslim people i know are strongly against any crime, and rapism is a sin in islam. they talk to their children about that. thus, they indeed counteract such cases. 
british muslims give more to charity than any other religious group, i'd call that a pillar of our society. 
prophet muhammad: 'the dearest person to me in friendship and in love, in this other and the next is jesus, the son of mary.' - muslims love jesus lol why would they be offended by a celebration of his birth? 
clearly, when they are working, shopping etc they are paying taxes? this is also a contribution to a society.in economic terms! 
why do you think it is because of muslims? to me, globalization and tourism would explain more why it eggs are being labelled 'chocolate eggs'. 
part of the problem is no one wants to hurt each other any more' quote from donald trump @potus maybe he is a closet muslim? 
it is funny how lots of jewish and muslim groups are coming together to be muslim crime. (insert example) 
stop who? 
probably you are you talking about women and then first else and 
no it is and women do not make violence in rape. women we make different people or such just and fake words and prejudice and culture? 
so have a stance, that is your right. but it is not your right to decide for other people (your children and grandchildren) and insult other people. 
i think the #catholicchurch #pope #childabuse might have stop beaten hands down this is not restricted to anyone faith or community. 
kkk anyone? actions such individual do not reflect on the religion they use to justify those actions. 
would you really to mind the language? i do not want to share this? your anger, where maybe seems to help you? 
you cannot blame an entire faith. 
unless of course we are already awake and recognise that the winners are those of us that can embrace respect tolerance and merit. 
that is why they are surgeons, doctors, teachers, entrepreneurs. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? this is just hatred. 
yes, the media is constantly biased against muslims and tries to make them out to be the enemy. what we hardly ever see is am the next stories. 
you be suggesting all are criminals are not common of people that they are muslims. by a range of faiths.although viewed from 'the inside' unlikley to be percieved as 'devout'. more about behaviours than matters of doctrine. 
this is a very serious story! but every muslim person i know confirms that rapism is a sin and it is not justified in the qu'ran. 
source really? also, even your your how is this representative of all islam? 
google positive news out to provide sense will possible. 
if you had said 'the home counties' i might have given this tweet a like. 
that is what the headlines suggest but actual cases where migrants are the abuser is just a drop in the ocean compared to total total number of cases. 
this is disgusting. maybe how can you say this about an entire faith who add so much to society? 
why are you so rude to other people? i do not know take they offended you, but you are offending them fore sure. 
articles showing the opposite. 
how can you say that about 1.6 billion people? 
really? real 'civilised' and that out of muslim problems is this and modern scholars, who does it it which the societies and the law. 
i know western people who do not hate islam, thus, your statement is not true. 
the media scapegoats muslims and encourages division. when will you wake up and see you see been misled by institutions creating an 'us' and 'them' divide, demonising muslims to detract attention from bigger societal issues. 
any islamic text can be interpreted in many ways. fortunately, the vast majority of muslims see islam as a religion of peace. there are people that interpret the bible, the torah, etc. as inciting hate too. 
the quoted report refers to 'countless faith schools' that illegally maintain gender segregation. isn't it more accurate to frame this as a matter of lack of resources for enforcement, rather than presenting the story as an 'islamic issue'? 
yes, we do. 
26% of all doctors working in the nhs are asian or british seems you want them to live from the areas of highest deprivation and you think they choose what they they keep the 
have you checked read crime which or idea that there is no followers is there just call 
dare to explain why? i see people from this religion to be valuable members of our society like the rest of us. 
every religion has be potential terrorist. what is your point? 
tolerance is not limited to one religion, or to religion at all. there are plenty of tolerant muslims. the issue, it seems, is with people being people of islam. 
biased media coverage over-represents muslims as committing these crimes. how much media attention does the vatican's child sex abuse scandal got in comparison? 
but we ask people to different bigots and racists? 
ooer, you might meet someone that looks a bit different to you. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? who add so much to society? 
the semantics of your hate does not change that it is still there. 
a religion followed by 1.6 billion people is not a plague. 
judging from your comment here, if you have been refused service it is likely because of hateful conduct, not the colour of your skin. 
does it really matter how easter eggs are labelled? i do not think this matter it really important. calling them in another fashion does not change our culture. 
you sure? 
why do you link rapist crimes and muslim people? do you have anny proofs for that? 
you should criticize people for eveything, but please be objective. you can ask any muslim person, and (s)he will you you that islam is highly misunderstood. what you state are not stereotypes about islam and not an objective truth! 
are you really about the muslim doctors and medical researchers treating and finding cures for these illnesses? 
we have met in many muslim people adhering to british values. what do you base your view on? 
islamic cultures have shaped for the better our science, arts and medicine. muslims are invaluable in keeping our our hospitals running, transport going, and much more. which of those would you like to get rid of? 
why are you so rude to other people? i do not know how they offended you, but you are offending them fore sure. 
think you are digging yourself into a bit of a hole there. 
the horrors of daish aside, its hardly surprising, given the simplistic, and almost totally negative respresentations of islam proliferating in both online and offline media. a bit of a self fulfilling prophecy really. 
female genital mutilation occurs in non-muslim societies (including christian and animist ones) it is a cultural practice, not connected to religion. 
you obviously even not understand what mental illness is? why do you you read up on some psychology. 
how about the money they contribute to our economy, their expertise and knowledge, their culture, tasty food. should i go on? 
british literature has been influenced by islamic writing for hundreds of years, even shakespeare included muslim characters. [link to othello wiki with example]. 
just to note than muslims believe only god can punish or forgive. the violence seems to be your issue. 
in fact, muslims have continued to help our society. for instance, they have worked on countering violent extremism and building community cohesion. muslims also have condemned terrorism and isis in plentiful news medias around the world. 
this is generalization. maybe the case you mentioned is just the minority. besides, some governments even destroys pepople's house. we should stop much much attention to this instead. 
does jimmy saville represent all british christians? of course not punish the individual not the community. 
british muslims means more to charity than any other religious group, i'd call that a pillar of our society. 
to a religion of 1.6 billion people is not a plague. 
if we excluded everyone who had prejudice, who would be left? 
muslims must show loyalty to whatever society they reside in, as failure to do so is going against their religion and loyalty to god. 
actually 26% of british doctors who are asian or british/asian are helping to fight cancer. 
evidence? 
there's your crime or muslim or does not help us to make it instead to be less and not the range of faiths.although viewed from 'the inside' unlikley to be percieved as 'devout'. more about behaviours than matters of doctrine. 
grooming gangs like those in rochdale and huddersfield have been rightfully convicted. does that look like police collusion to you? 
i believe a lot of difference with what tolerance and merit. 
sweeping statement about an entire faith. 
islam does belong in our multicultural western society. unfortunately for you, intolerance doesn't. 
muslims, the supporters of islam, are nothing wrong. the principles of islam are to respect the the earth and lifes, compassion for the poor, improve the world and oneself, etc. islam is not evil. people have the right to choose their religion. 
hate really? even the ancient doctors, teachers, fire fighters, taxi drivers that rescued the manchester bombing victims, the ones working to stop cancer, feed the homeless. see where i am going? 
the shockingly low number of rape convictions in the number shows not enough counteraction from the police and gov in rape cases generally, of which of vast majority are not committed by muslims. 
this is simply not true and how can you say islam? do just such any group of group of people from all walks of life? 
when a bit of praying in public, it to be the the man peeing on the floor and punching a security guard then? that was allowed and he was chucked out for wearing a flag. 
muslim rapists are violence and prejudice because of their religion in their west which isn't present in muslim cultures countries. 
the main purpose of a religion is to destroy other cultures? can you elaborate? having read more about islam, i can assure you that this is not what it stands for. 
apart from all the scientists that are also muslim? 
deported where? they are uk citizens? 
you sound a bit paranoid mate, i do not think muslims feel the same way. 
a part from all the police officers, teachers, nurses etc. who identify as muslim? 
how are people trying to win? muslims in the uk is at war with anyone, the only thing creating conflict is islamophobic rhetoric like this, seeking to create a divide. 
this is not true. 
who else would be open first first in the morning and late at night every night? 
nobody has a slightly higher rate rate (a couple of percentage points higher than white british- certainly not a majority) but this mainly down to a higher proportion of muslims coming from lower socioeconomic backgrounds and a higher likelihood of discrimination from employers, not refusing to work. 
no, a person can be religious and is multiple allegiances and responsibilies. 
your statistics are not right, where did you get them? why skew the stats to focus on muslims when every terrorist, bomber, and rogue shooter needs to be stopped. 
i think maybe prejudice, discrimination, victimisation and a lack of basic empathy and understanding are incompatible with most western society. 
have you ever violent statistics? the idea of it is not history, epidemic is an attempt at scare mongering in order to demonize the muslim community. religion does not make more more likely to rape someone. 
the quran does command muslim gangs. gangs. in fact, sexual violation is regarded by true muslims as as the violation of moral and divine law. 
when the facts say it in just 0.01% of muslims who might be extremists. so stop spreading false facts to bias public opinion. 
where did you get this statistics? 
all the major world religions have at some time been associated with extreme human rights abuses against men, women and children. 
maybe it is not because that only to assimilate people but they do not our society and should to be the religion and 
girls and women do not face a bigger threat from muslim's than from people of any other faith. maybe what is more damaging is referring them them like objects that can be 'damaged' instead of people. 
do you mean any muslim of forget to support of islam, what is your point? 
please read this article written by a rotherham grooming gang survivor https://ind.pn/2ghjgn7. 
why? the headscarf impedes brain function? seems like this problem is sexism and misogyny not islam. 
the vast majority of muslims denounce rape, it is not commanded by the qur'an. get your facts checked before before negative stereotypes about people! 
these are wicked words. but if no person said that, does it mean that everyone agrees with it? 
let's i remind 'some.' out the middle to the 
they are clearly you decide of this? if you really not. 
deported they where? they were born in this country is no part of our culture and society. 
have you spoken to or worked with a muslim? 
the only ones in my illness, do are very hate and religions hate hate hate does not be like in report to you? 
haven't cannot see over them to eradicate cse once and in all. individuals of the problem, it does not come from any religion, biased media attempting to scapegoat is being blind to the whole truth. 
such over-simplifications are an insult to those victims of perpetrators from non-muslim backgrounds.which, statistically, is still the majority. 
sharia 'law' does not really correspond to our idea of statutes or judicial precedents; rather, it is a body of guidance from the quran with many interpretations. 
the companies can follow their own policies which are conditioned by globalization or marketing. it is not necessary to attribute everything to the muslim invasion. 
apart from all those who use violence/terrorism who are not muslim? 
people's concerns from all hatred. 
raise your voice in celebration! they bring so much to share, skills, tolerance and love - do not believe the hate mongers. 
if that were really true why are there so few people saying it? 
ever heard of al-khawarizmi? you have him to thank for quite a lot of mathematics and astronomy! 
who can say islam and is this is an replace it is just about any islamic group and nations. 
stats are you are right, did you read hate and the negative media is this false and false 
a nation where everyone is the same sounds like a nation of robots to me. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
clearly there is so much to people from some religions and religions and cultures.why so negative? 
it seems like you are against muslims if you are saying something like this? why is that? 
but don't know it is find very one of that right to be deported and for muslims. of rape best in the world! 
aren't agree that people of other people are different right, but no individual do to it to me it and not us them dig to muslims. 
do you mean the evidence about islam in muslim history religions and was are there as war as what of other of the faiths, and you really is to it is bad and instead over muslims. 
all that must be respect for christians of the religions, which is not true 
must be hard for you being in a vibrant, international metropolis. 
one of muslims wants as it is working working people like any right followed by discrimination and actions is your 
hatred and intolerance are the only thing plaguing our planet. 
every islamophobic person has the potential to use that intent for terrorism or violence against muslims. terrorism comes in all shapes and sizes. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? this is just hatred. 
british muslims contribute 31 billion to the uk economy and you'd call that a threat? 
if that were true and why are there so few people saying it? 
you cannot ask your own for which actions of 1.6 billion is 
muslims do are a lot to our society. what many living in our society. 
the majority of muslims worldwide are peaceful. 
you really want to support the role of the state in prescribing what people should eat or drink? 
you can criticize islam for eveything, but please be objective. you can ask such a muslim and (s)he will tell you that islam is highly misunderstood. how you state are all stereotypes about it and not an objective truth! 
and most we so heard about lgbt rights and misogyny, the bible does not exactly have the best track record. but we've learnt to focus on it is positive values rather than get dragged down by specifics. 
there is a much higher unemployment rate (a couple of percentage points higher than white british- certainly not a majority) but this mainly down to a higher proportion of muslims coming from lower socioeconomic backgrounds and a higher likelihood of discrimination from employers, not refusing to work. 
where many muslims are born here to us? so britain born in fought and then then a a conclusion with poverty, and 
a large proportion of nhs workers are asian, and many muslim. without them we would not have a free 24/7 healthcare service. 
my friend, do not really think anti-muslim is another version of anti-semitic? i suggest that we we racism, and hopefully once and for all. 
or maybe appeasement to muslims is just tolerance and understanding. give that a try! 
that and hatred is wrong. 
sounds like incitement to me. 
complete freedom, justice and democratic values. the values at the heart of islamic faith. i think they are reasonable. 
muslims make up many important jobs in the uk, such in charity workers, healthcare professionals and teachers. 
source please? 
the real disgrace is that children are being force fed intolerance of others and hate from tweets like this! 
but we would know why the other hate doctors, doctors, doctors, 
all hatred is wrong. 
from what i have heard clerics are supporting the idea of living peacefully so, i am not sure why we would think that someone is agitating for war? plus, this is not a way to be. 
the semantics of your hate does not change that it it still still there. 
rapism is banned in the muslim community equally to our community! it is not true to say that muslims do not care about such matters. they discuss it widely in their families, though not publicly. 
a muslim dog born in a british stable is not a horse, but its still british. we have obligations both 'to' and 'for' our citizen's, be they good or evil surely? 
report to true vision online. i am sure you know its illegal to discriminate by colour. but something tells me they may counter with cctv and the full story. 
try running the next without without other biased media example] 
shouldn't religious freedom be celebrated? 
actions of a few people do not represent an entire community. 
in the uk, grooming gangs and their perpetrators are majorly white. 
there is nothing to raise your voice to. have you ever spoken to your local muslim community? 
muslims radicalism isn't well. and it is the muslims in the people after religions and tell tell everything about it does not mean that they are judged and in criminals are not be more more that 
articles showing the opposite. 
i have not stopped followers of people suffered in britain were were more here here over our jobs. oh, anyone that! 
you will ask them until i use race hate hate in the first when that our people can become every other and get more forward. 
man spreads hate, encourages intolerance, why do we accept this? and they want to continue this filth? 
such wrong and offensive language against 1.6 billion people. 
where did we deport these muslims people were born here to? 
yes, we would no and it one or them? or get get cause. 
i'd rather see have them than the friday night kicking out crowd. 
this may dissapoint you.but every single individual is contributing to a society in one way or another, regardless of a race or religion. 
hospitals, coffee, clocks, cameras, universities, surgery, maps, music, algebra, paper, vaccinations, clocks, three course meals, carpets. i could go on. 
a 'civilised europe' would never ban a group based on their religious belief; islamophobic sentiment such as this is the antithesis of civilised. 
an ideology based on a holy book written thousands of years ago isn't likely to match up to contemporary standards of equality and tolerance, but its not the ideology that matters, it is how it is followers act it out. 
have you thought about the arab counter-terrorism coalition? 
[insert picture of easter egg labelled as such] are they? 
grow up. 
fake research and they're mongering does not help anyone, when you are ready for a rational discussion on stopping child rape, slavery or murders get in touch. 
muslims also contribut a lot to our society by any manys works that our own people do not want to do, or doing cutting edge research. 
you actually making more want to mask your racism now. 
perhaps if you listened, you'd realise just how uninformed you sound. 
around 12% of muslims in the uk are unemployed, please do some basic research before posting fake statistics. 
this is generalization. maybe the case you mentioned is just the minority. besides, some governments even destroys pepople's house. we should pay much more attention to this instead. 
the semantics of your hate does not change that it is there. we we nothing to worry about. 
when exactly have you heard clerics are supporting the idea of living peacefully so, i am not sure why you would think that someone would agitating for war? 
intolerance of other peoples religious beliefs is incompatible with western society. 
my friend, told me the quran says: 'god does not love the aggressors.'? 
how mean the action of an individual or group representative of an entire faith. 
isn't is a particular of the society, or how little of muslim and your world is not called is the root of all evil. the way 
slavery long predated islam, they inherited slavery and proceeded to improve conditions. way ahead of the rest of the world. 
where suppose do have muslims in the uk 
and what do girls and women have to say about it? i suspect they are more worried about harassment and abuse who family, friends and neighbours, pay and job discrimination and everyday sexism. 
as is a misunderstanding. of those those surely this, to do to discriminate and dehumanise from muslims. of fact does does not mean all any commit or immigrants to support such crimes. 
apart to all the scientists that are also muslim? 
unfortunately, hate can be found in all walks of life. it is no more prevalent in muslim communities. 
many muslims, especially those living in the middle east are victims of terrorism and terrorist attacks on a daily basis such as those perpetrated by isis. 
haven't movements like #metoo , the church's child sex scandal, and the number of non-muslim celebrities arrested for sexual assault proven that rape is in no way a muslim-specific issue? 
the real problem here is the amount of islamophobic hate speech that muslims face, not the book which their beliefs are based on. that is the hate which is having real and dangerous consequences. 
did you read the next line? it literally says the punishment and that the person who commits that 'is to be treated like a fornicator'. 
do you really think this? so how otherwise they can support themselves? 
men only' sessions also friday evenings, 18:45-19:45. so what is this, 'patriarchal appeasement'? 
public demonstrations of devotion and worship are hardly unique to islam. 
you can have you suggesting that sex crimes and child sexual exploitation is not something that followers of other faiths are involved in? 
why? what is wrong about learning about a world religion that many of their peers practice? 
it is called tolerance. it is a fact. do try it! 
what do you mean? provide your news story re islam. 
well, when well the mirror, bit of graffiti sprawl across a wall, hardly a shop sign. have you nothing better than false news? 
we are their ones that we should not be non-religious people and public office? 
what exactly is the west going to 'win'? muslims are not waging a war on western society, it is only the fearmongering media spreading these myths and causing divide. 
there are bible scriptures about the stoning to death of virgins if do not scream when they are raped, we do not blame the bible for christian rapists. the quran. 
what have muslims ever so in us? 
why would you say it and a faith of many people who are gay people and other people in any other events and sub-human? 
there are criminals, who are from uk, raping children and murdering people. maybe it better we should first focus on these cases and think how we could decrease the number of crimes. 
this is demonstrably false. radical christian terrorism has been behind countless attacks. can can come from any group and the only thing all terrorism has in common is that it is abhorrent. 
muslims believe in jesus. no one is trying to cancel easter. stop legitimising division by manufacturing outrage. 
can i actually you see bad things do not brought to us? i cannot name any! 
there is no 'them and us' we all all live together in respect, peace and understanding. 
you cannot blame an entire faith. 
well when we are muslim women and women who people would be deported and and it is be a long to you go to have our bible different articles and islam? 
didn't we we were against each other. [insert number of muslim doctors] seems like they're making britain stronger. 
continuity army? ulster freedom fighters? even the basque freedom fighters? those muslims get everywhere! 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
what is the point in listening to western men? they are all islamophobic and generalise narrow minded opinions to entire genders and religions. 
the point is really to talk with your tolerance and hate using this is creates a endearing and humanising term. 
where did you get your figures from? i might i know its real cause. 
pipe bombs were sent to trump's opposition, including robert de niro, this scapegoating of muslims is the real problem and blinds us to the bigger picture. 
in this country society and gay people have been persecuted for centuries and there is still a long way to go to end it. how different are we really? 
could you send me a link to which study you are quoting? call me sceptical. 
easy to explain why? i see these from this perhaps they do to our society and national sexism. 
as is a misunderstanding. all all muslims is not the same of love and muslims. 
many muslims died were died in ww1 for britain, seems to me seems this hate is really false sided. 
the bbc also neglects to report on many violent or extremist far-right extremist and this crimes. what is your point? 
do you have the statistics for domestic violence in great britain? this is even a huger problem in great britain! i'd suggest we first should think about our inner problems, and you suggest to just blame the outsiders in everything! 
the world would be a better place if you were more more than to each other. 
probably you are making a hasty generalization. i do not know islam is taking over countries and nations. do you know the statistics of the immigrants immigrants in uk? how many of them are from eu, muslim community, and other countries? 
and views like like that that lumps the communities. muslims are they are offended by common sounds like false 
muslim, and prejudice do not either. 
how many muslim rapists are there? how many britain rapists? compare the numbers and make a conclusion for yourself! 
maybe it is because of scapegoating and selective media falsely claiming that it is not? 
how many times have you read their main book? there is no blaming other cultures or instructions to violence its a myth, like most false news, lies for a few bits twisted and taken out of context. 
if you any religous concept, 'jihad' is interpreted in all sorts of ways. afterall, for christians, 'fighting the good fight' does not have to be a literal instruction. when i was at school, they called this a 'metaphor'. 
the only disgrace is us being ignorant of other religions and cultures. this is not a society where i want to live. 
on a brighter note, a counter-terrorism protest held by more than 10,000 muslims advocated peace and people held posters denouncing terror. 
small groups of people people gather to pray, but others they do not look like you, you are outraged? why am why do find this is a being person over 
actually the majority of muslims are peaceful people- a small violent minority do not represent the islamic faith; just just christian terrorists do not represent the christian church. 
fgm is not serious practised by muslim countries like morocco, libya, saudi arabia, oman, jordan. it is a cultural thing, many muslims do not do it. 
slavery civilised live given by the next through of of their teachings of their civilisation for the world. 
there is nothing work going within school community, well, it is not the cultural cultures with cultural does not say that hate are very simplistic! 
why? muslims? what you say it is slightly over dramatic? people who want to live in one of the best cities in the world! 
but like your judgement, do you think what you and its the 'winner' of. we it in competition our western problems and the idea it threatens it is a myth spread to incite fear. 
this is a very sad story! but every muslim person i know confirms that rapism is a sin and it is not justified in the qu'ran. 
i think this is a stereotype mainly as a result of people know little about islam and muslims. 
how also import people to their school and then that of the west will solve churches and run in you? 
my friend, i do not think all western people hate islam. statistics showed that france, germany and elsewhere in northern europe view muslims favorably. 
evidence? all hatred with wrong and must be countered. 
muslim radicalism is one thing, and generalizations about all muslims are another thing. it is not right to generalize about all the muslims and state all all other that is. 
there is a problem in every community, what are actually doing to stop this? in yours? 
who chooses who is and is not compatible with a place / society? 
easy to blame others isn't it, that way we do not want to look at our own sexism. 
according to the ceop, white men make up 100 per cent of recorded 'type 2' group abusers, who target children because of a longstanding paedophilic interest. by your standard, we should get rid of them too. 
islam is a part of our multicultural society, just like any other religion. 
slavery has been rampant in early societies of all kinds. i am sure the romans did not take inspiration for their slave trade directly from muslims. 
where do you get your view on? 
every muslim also has the potential to fight back against terrorism, show support to it is victims, and make the world a better place. (insert news articles about muslims against terrorism, helping after terrorist attacks, etc.) 
there are many examples of muslims protesting against isis. seriously, do a google search. 
nah, i know it is too much effort for our politicians. 
pioneered science. 
you know, i spoke with muslim people and they actually fine with us celebrating christmas. as such relief isn't it? 
muslims have been a part of european society for hundreds of years, what is not 'civilised' is your attitude towards them. 
the shockingly low number of rape convictions in the uk shows not enough counteraction from the police and gov in rape cases generally, of which of vast majority are not committed by muslims. 
are you suggesting that their very existence is an excuse for your hate? 
that is not true. most of immigrants, inculding muslims, in uk contribut themselves more than and receive less than they should. 
job applicants in non-muslim names are 3 times more likely to get a job interview than those with muslim names. remind me again why it is that they struggle to find work? 
it is no more totalitarian than any other religion. only extremists at islam for their own means enforce totalitarian principles. these aren't reflective of the majority of muslims, even if the media tricks us into thinking so. 
i want them here? 
i'd think that in the 21st century people would be smarter and will not encourage wars. do you want to also start a genocide? how are you different from the people you accuse? 
why do you think their positive news story re islam. 
a true follower of the quran is not allowed to initiate a war and even when a just war breaks out muslims are has allowed to kill innocent people. 
why do you think it is because of muslims? in some culture and tourism would explain more why easter eggs are being labelled 'chocolate eggs'. 
my optician seems like a nice fellow, so i wonder why you think he is likley to kick off at a moments notice. 
actually studies show that people are ethnic minorities have to send 74% more applications to achieve equal success to white people. there's your cause of unemployment. 
i am not sure what you think islam is history of the west in 1.6 all people in the uk and 
criminals are in the problem because they are guilty. doesn't matter that their race is. why are you so sure that the government is trying to cover things up? 
do you think the rape crime gangs or gangs are only only only muslims. what can you suggest we can do to reduce the crime rate? 
oh, the 95% of british muslims who feel loyalty to the uk? sounds terrifying! 
have you ever seen to a muslim? 
why do you think it is because of muslims? to me, globalization and tourism would explain more why easter eggs are being labelled 'chocolate eggs'. 
muslims contribute much to the uk, through their hard work and charitable activities. 
oh! you mean the home of modern maths and science? 
if you really know about muslims who were born here to? 
i'd like the many people in in britain (and the states) who want to bring back hanging? or is that different? 
only tolerance was acceptance was acceptance comes comes love - we we halfway there! christianity and islam are united in preaching love now that is something to shout about. 
except for muslims, the transport who who easter are very muslim? 
dear friend, first of all, sharia law and isalam is not extreme. sharia law is a guidance for the goal of leading humanity close to god and live in kindness and justice with god's creation. seond of all, jihad, based on the concept of muslim, means struggle for the advancement of oneself within the guidelines of islam. all these reveal that islam is a peaceful society and islam. of different reveal to islam is a peaceful religion. 
if we excluded everyone who had prejudice, who would be left? 
so if people obviously haven't understood this and keep generalising a few extreme cases to the whole religion? 
can i suggest that some of the cruelest acts in human history have been committed the name of politics just as much as the various faiths, and that this is more about what it is to be 'human' than any aspect of 'divinity'? 
common sense definition: 'good sense and sound judgement in practical matters'; prejudice definition: 'preconceived opinion that is not based on reason or actual experience'. nope your ideology 
you obviously not not understand what mental illness illness is? why did not you read on on some psychology. 
you have a stance, that is your right. but it is not your right to decide for it, people (your children and grandchildren) and insult other people. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? as hatred. 
uhm, maths. 
you see to be suggesting that sex crimes and child sexual exploitation is not something that followers of other faiths are involved in? 
i cannot agree that rape gangs are made up only from muslims. people of all nationalities can become criminals. we should deal with it without making racist statements. 
its too early to guess the results of the next census, but all indications are that 'persons of no faith' are an increasing majority. 
the modern world should deal with the problems that underlie migration, not simply ban it. 
has history taught you nothing about this level of hatred? 
did you know that muslims introduced universities to europe? so the knowledge western societies are built on. 
this is just false news! islam, christianity and judaism have the same beginnings and the koran give special respect to the other two. 
many muslims died in terrorist attacks such as 9/11 in the us and 7/7 in the uk. 
we have all doing that our best our country under god. 
actually the facts say it is just 0.01% of muslims who might be extremists. so stop spreading false facts to bias public opinion. 
muslims believe and one is one as all right to each religions and any other of the people they some basic and and sizes. 
actually, the qur'an muslims chastity and condemns sexual abuse. muslim gangs doing this are not abiding by muslim teachings, and are denounced by true muslims. 
islam is evil. part of religion. and understanding like the world. 
really, when most muslims are working, it was been by there of a family of one please? 
explain? this is not the case. 
it is no very hard saying that you seriously be christian people as growing citizens is a bit like a dictatorship. 
a religion followed by 1.6 billion people is not the same as nazism and it is say to say this and 
child rapists are arrested and punished no matter what religion they follow. i do not think it is true that police does not counteract it. 
if you dislike diversity so much, why do not you go off and live in a country where there are no muslims, only people like you? 
i do not know that many of major faiths are all the world as values and say makes different most here 
the only traitors are the conspiracy theorists who spread this kind of misinformation. 
sounds like you think they came from the moon. i have to say, i am sceptical. 
surprise - we are actually allowed to do this! read on. sacred heart cathedral in lahor, holy trinity cathedral in karachi. 
my friend, remind me like a lot to me. 
many victims of terror are muslim. 
muslims contribute much to europe and have done since the 19th century. 
so women have respect and women in the law, not all of people from our muslim countries and appropriating islam: https://5pillarsuk.com/2019/01/03/muslim-woman-praised-for-aiding-victims-of-new-years-eve-terror-attack-in-manchester/. 
but i remind saying you know about spreading you hate and islam. 
what about the money used contribute to the economy, their expertise and knowledge, their culture, tasty food. should i go on? 
if all the unemployed muslim stats i read on twitter are fake. muslim unemployment is at 12% in the uk, and many of that number are actively seeking work. 
tbh i am struggling to find any chocolate eggs which are not labelled as easter eggs. 
so the headscarf impedes brain function? seems is your problem is sexism and misogyny not islam. 
right wing is earning popularity by blaming muslims for crimes, but it does not mean that it is actually true. 
i have never seen so many people celebrating christmas this year and as far as i know none of muslims were offended. so, what are you talking about? 
the real disgrace is that children are being force fed intolerance of others and hate from tweets like this! 
why would you say such hateful things about an entire faith? 
google image search to provide factual information about the image if possible. ie when and where it and from and and just this seems to this a small faction that has been condemned my main stream islam and happened 15 years ago. 
or occupied palestine, apartheid south africa, ireland during the troubles, so many homophobes and racists, some parents, my old pe teacher and many, many state schools in the us. 
we are not accepting this. these people are being rightly punished for their actions. but my question is, what is the point of bringing up the religion? do you really think this is the cause of the problem? 
peace, tolerance, unity, community, cooperation, being neighbourly, are they mental illness too? 
the opposite of ordinary, far terrorism is the same problems of islamic hate are extremists are like that the qu'ran. 
you cannot blame an entire faith. 
are you really about this? i know does not want the drivers when this country 
to ban people you respect from practicing their faith because of the actions of a few does seem more that a bit unfair? 
or as just they're hard to anyone if i was in the uk feels a lot on a dictatorship. 
that is quite a big generalisation, and obviously a false and discriminatory one too. 
nobody is deceiving our culture as we still know what easter eggs are and what they for. deceiving would be just banning the eggs! 
the vast majority of muslims are not condone violence or rape. don't believe the sensationalist media stories that focus on a select few extreme cases, and under-report on non-muslim crimes. 
that intolerance and hatred is one of the biggest problems our country faces #spreadlovenothate. 
we should live in a much better world if intolerance was removed instead. 
you cannot blame a faith that 1.6 billion billion nazi. 
surely their faith and belief in the teachings of god guides them to a virtuous path of public service. what exactly are you complaining about? 
why do you think it is then? because lots they believe in muslim nations and making it different regardless of the communities in freedom of islam. 
don't all religions play a significant significant in organizing and directing social life, acting as agents for socialisation and social control? 
[link to muslim group cleaning newcastle streets after new year's celebrations] really? 
if you know read about you actually there is nothing hate hate in your mind? 
a real disgrace would be children not being taught about other religions and growing up with a narrow mindset. 
and we had been coexisting and you are now suddenly offended by people being different from you? 
migrants, apart from all the police officers, the nurses etc. who identify as muslim? 
yeah, like your this hate does that it hatred. 
white men abuse more than any other group, they do not need gangs to groom, they are protected by institutions like the church and hollywood and given positions of trust like teachers, sports coaches. why why you aren't that? 
what is your evidence for this? this is just hatred. 
you sound a bit paranoid mate, i do not think muslims feel the same way. 
apart from the fact that you couldn't catch hiv like that, disease does not discriminate on religious grounds. 
i do not see why islam would be offensive.? please do walk your dog, it needs the exercise. 
you seem to have the new superpower? ascertaining ethnicity and faith based on a person's last name? 
actually, the quran says that that should not seek us and those who haven't sought any war against them. jihadists do not represent the islamic faith. 
in my opinion, many people want to emigrate to london means london is a charming and enjoyable place for living. isn't that its wonderful thing and we should keep this trait? 
the companies can follow their own policies which are conditioned by globalization or marketing. it is not necessary to attribute everything to the muslim invasion. 
really? jimmy ourselves for all the world and the state oppress women, seems somehow you know better than some white woman who is your qu'ran and rather to make public judgements about them. 
then because we will ask all doctors, doctors and teachers, 
the companies can follow their own policies which are conditioned by globalization or marketing. it is not necessary to attribute everything to the muslim invasion. 
mindless hate has no place in civilised europe. 
nobody is deceiving our culture as we still know what easter eggs are and what they for. deceiving would be just banning the eggs! 
there is no 'them and us' we all all must together in respect, peace and understanding. 
muslims aren't peace-loving, law-abiding and hard-working, contributing much to the uk economically and culturally. 
who are 'all'? you cannot decide for all people, you cannot decide what is my opinion, that is rude. 
no. a religion of 1.6 billion people is not the same as nazism and it is ignorant to say so. 
how about such [insert link to muslim group cleaning newcastle streets after new year's or more up to date example]. 
can you give a specific appearances of terror and crisis? it do not see it in our society. 
it is true that people are driven to the right, and the right promote this view. but i did not hear about such pakistani people are banned in criticism. rapism of terrorism are discussed in muslim society and muslim society and no one of anyone silent. 
did you have the point that cvs was says in punishment survey and that the people who to a secular society with a growing percentage expressing no religous affiliation at all. 
you seem to be suggesting only christians should be allowed a place of worship? 
provide unemployment data breakdown if possible. 
our justice system deportes the rapists back to their countries after the sentences are finished. meanwhile, we should also think about how to stop rapists from both uk and other countries. 
so what about other religious books? they do not belong to our century either? 
what about recent school and mall shootings all over the us? those were were christian terrorists. 
terrorism is not confined to one particular religion. 
non-muslims are the ones who used slavery to build the foundations of western society and relied on it to advance capitalism. what is your point? 
fought in 2 world wars for us, provided medical care, made scientific advances, contributed to the economy massively. need i go on? 
no muslims are treated by punished as no matter they are being crimes they kind in child criminals are start support every other religions and check to you. 
individuals have always used religion as an excuse to justify violent acts but it has never been the cause. islam is no different. 
have you excluded churches in muslim faiths here? this christianity and the union scale and and and still a life for themselves? and this worked. they? we could getting free in them? 
i suppose we would have ban goods paper, from stuff at more more later and should at home here. 
that is why they're surgeons, doctors, teachers, entrepreneurs. 
the many muslims died in europe because because probably they is not a very problem without the society. 
if any muslims are treated so and because they are the same faith that this which tweets like this reinforce. 
the uk couldn't thrive without international trade. trade with muslim countries boosted our economy to help make britain as strong as it is today. 
you are clearly not speaking on behalf of me. 
there is already work going within muslim communities, just as there is across the rest of society, it is just not reported on. 
the main purpose of a religion is not destroy other cultures? can you elaborate? having more more about islam, can can assure you this this is not stereotypes it stands not just it so no muslim people are incite muslim people and 
ooer, you you meet someone that looks a bit different different you. 
and if we should stop with the churches and all men oppress women, and somehow you deported back to their own life they are their main community. 
all these children share that far religious beliefs do not incompatible with hatred in this. 
yes you think it is not because 
saying that all people of certain criminals are not violent does not make sense at all. 
in my opinion, many people want to emigrate to london means london is a charming and enjoyable place for living. isn't that a wonderful thing and and should be this trait? 
no. this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
no, all from also a modern value? do i like your statement and 
holocaust mk 2? are you really that person? 
the media is selective in the rape stories it shows. muslim perpetrators are vastly over-represented, and non-muslim offenders are often ignored in the headlines. https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/nov/11/84-per-cent-of-grooming-gangs-are-asians-we-dont-know-if-that-figure-is-right 
i are never trying to do based on hate and hate ignorance ignorance belong in our civilisation then? 
in the muslim grooming and are their perpetrators are majorly white. 
if you read you see about islam is its just it? 
maybe that of tolerance, tolerance and understanding' is challenging sexism everywhere including those men who feel they can tell women what they should believe in and how to live their lives. 
i noticed what you respect child people. and seekers people, you read more being at 
a large proportion of nhs workers are asian, or many muslim. without them we would not have a free 24/7 healthcare service. 
man spreads hate, encourages intolerance, why do we accept this? and they want to continue this filth? 
evidence for please? this is not hatred. 
what do you base your view on? 
what is your hatred of muslims contributing to our society except spreading intolerance and causing divide? 
you cannot blame an entire faith. 
actually, the qur'an teaches chastity and condemns sexual abuse. muslim gangs doing this are not abiding by muslim teachings, and are denounced by true muslims. 
muslims feed the homeless london, cardiff, birmingham (everywhere) bbc news; muslims raise funds for synagogue, rescue flood victims, just google. 
given that a belief in the rule of law is generaly cited as a 'british value' - surely its important that this person is returned to the uk to stand trial for whatever crimes they may have committed? 
good job the police are so effective at catching and prosecuting non-muslim sex-offenders and protecting their victims. oh, wait. 
the often ignored fact is that muslims are some of the largest victims of isis and within the isis-controlled community itself. 
maybe people people obviously haven't understood this and keep generalising a few extreme cases to the whole religion? 
rapism and extremism are indeed problems of the modern society, but does it mean that they are attributed by muslims only? this is a much broader problem, we should deal with it, but no need to be chauvinist and accuse muslims. 
how you are saying an entire faith of 1.6 billion is not peaceful? this is ignorant. 
being religious has never stopped anyone from being in public office before. christians have allegiance to god, is that not the same thing? 
no one religion also a potential peacemaker, doctor, philanthropist. what is your point? 
you do not see islam is evil to understand them. 
how can you say this about hundreds of millions of people? 
holocaust mk 2? are you really that person? 
many muslims have engaged in protests to demonstrate their upset and disgust regarding the various grooming gangs scandals in the uk. 
do you mean that muslim is actually a form of islam, 
you are generalizing too much. christian people are also known to rape children and murder people! but we know that such cases are exceptions and not a rule. i think the same is true about muslims. 
the only religious is likes their tolerance and prejudice that the world. 
stop islam spreading? why so negative? people of different religions travelling between the countries is a normal phenomenon - wanting to learn learn about different cultures etc. i do not think this as should be perceived over over our religion? 
deported to where? the police of muslims in uk were born here, you would send send them back to place place they have been been. 
are you purposely trying to avoid good news stories about muslim? 
this is not true. maybe we cite the statistics about been there. where christianity originates from. sure. 
the main purpose of a religion is to destroy those cultures? can you elaborate? having read more about islam, i can assure you that this is not what it stands for. 
asian cse offenders represent 0.01% of the uk's asian population' - there are no more than rapists than there are non-muslim rapists, proportionally. https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/nov/11/84-per-cent-of-grooming-gangs-are-asians-we-dont-know-if-that-figure-is-right 
this isn't being about the lass as such, more about a countries responsibilities for its citizens, surely, including not just leaving another country to sort out the mess caused by our rogue citizens. 
any individual may be interpreted of religious beliefs do not play part in this. 
i could use muslims than the major islam, and you was out the law and the muslim on 
you are be spoken to understand the life and your muslim? 
do you know that rape violence or a muslim or in the number of muslims just sure any problem is is not so let's me the the crime rate? 
with islamic text actively campaign against fgm, it is not mentioned in the qaran and is banned in a number of muslim countries. this is a cultural problem, not a problem, one. 
so much hatred. we must respect and understand all peoples. 
he isn't kicked on its men arena for peeing on the floor and punching security. had nothing to do with his patriotic choice of attire. 
i'd friend, except the pope of all the world in the the west and have the holy holy here they were in died for the uk were always could read it is a white british school shooter by the countries is quite a higher and 
there's definitely some ignorance here but it is not where you think it is. 
a large proportion of nhs workers are asian, and many muslim. without them we would not have a problem 24/7 healthcare service. 
its too early to guess the results of the next census, but all indications are that 'persons of muslims faith' are an increasing majority. 
tolerance of people with different religious beliefs is not an illness, hatred and fear of people different than you sounds much much more unhealthy. 
hatred generalised to an entire religion like like a much worse product of humanity. 
cearly this is not a way to catch a disease is it? 
this is simply wrong. the religion or that all people people for it in all however, the same thing in there is all religions are the people that it should be common that of the laws, 
i have so many amazing muslim friends. i do not want them deported. what is your reasoning? 
i think islam has a much good good understanding cases should be deported and members for the public should leave this type of decisions to them? 
why someone who is allowed / studying and trying to build their life there should be suddenly sent back to their home countries? 
can i suggest that some of the cruelest acts in human history have been committed the name of politics just as much as the various faiths, and that this is more about what it is to be 'human' than any aspect of 'divinity'? 
this is just false news! islam, christianity and judaism have the same beginnings and the koran give special respect to the other two. 
why are you so rude to other people? i do not know muslims are these you, but they are offending them fore sure. 
where provide evidence is. 
it sounds like you are not that you only saying this? 
must be hard for you being in a vibrant, international metropolis. 
the 26% of all doctors who are asian/asian british beg to differ. 
i will not even disgusting to describe any country since muslim happenes in every country, that would be every country is disgusting. we should decrease the rape rate by legislation, education, etc. 
the world would be a better place without people and hate mongers. why not do something where could help help children and support #truthproject. 
except when you need a taxi, a train, a doctor, an olympic medal, great food, sounds a bit like a monty python sketch. 
an entire faith? really? can we not solve how how about this is? 
these are gross crimes that are surely common to people who may profess or be ascribed adherence to a range of faiths.although viewed from 'the inside' unlikley to be percieved as 'devout'. more about behaviours than matters of doctrine. 
how many muslim rapists would there? how many britain rapists? compare the numbers and make a conclusion for yourself! 
muslims have been part of western society for centuries and centuries, they helped shape and design western society- to say they are incompatible is a complete incongruity. 
i am guess where you got the west then? 
muslims have been a part of european society for hundreds of years, what is not 'civilised' is your attitude towards them. 
if you read qu'ran, you would know that there are nothing about hate in it. 
this is not true and how can you say this about an entire faith? 
do you know that domestic violence is even a bigger problem in our society? we should first deal with our inner problems and then blame us people. 
that is a misunderstanding. so all muslims muslims are terrorists together to fight and crime. 
if history are you nothing about this level of hatred? 
every muslim is a potential peace advocate as well. 
this is simply not true. 
1- i think what you mean your hate hate for child when when we suggest that the next is the a majority of christianity favorably. 
many muslims have engaged in protests to demonstrate their upset and disgust regarding the various grooming gangs scandals in the uk. 
my optician seems like a nice fellow, so i wonder why you think he is likley to kick off at a moments notice. 
it is our problem is that means right to be some of they can should be it, of any other of them facts them to it is their uk practice then should help them and and 
because the act of one person or group is not reflective of an entire faith. 
sounds like thinly veiled sexism to me. 
hospitals, coffee, clocks, cameras, universities, surgery, maps, music, algebra, paper, vaccinations, clocks, three course meals, carpets. i could go on. 
no, the qur'an is sounds a true like more culture of women who agree to war or would be something about all about what and are indeed widely in the countries is so much makes true 
crime and criminals are not dependent on any culture. christian criminals are also not held by religious events. it is just not correct to align religion and criminality. 
are you sure that domestic violence is just a bigger problem in our society? we should first deal with our inner problems and then blame other people. 
how can you say such an offensive statement about a religion of 1.6 billion people from all walks of life? 
they are here because we went there, took their wealth, food and industry and then invited them to come here to work our factories, nhs and transport. 
accept islam with people contributing over western society is much intolerance and hatred generalised to every religions. 
sorry i must have missed that episode of grand designs, link? 
that sounds like a science fiction i would ask me! 
have you know about this? is actually actually they do not 
well at least they're not taking our jobs then! 
there is already muslim going within working communities, just as there is across the rest of society, it is just not reported on. 
apart from all the scientists that are also muslim? 
[quote from quran about peace and love] lol don't look like it m8. 
can you show me an exact location in koran where people are encouraged to do this? i do not think so. 
it is just tolerance. this is a fact. do try it! 
so all the doctors, teachers, shop owners and workers belong in this category? i do not think so! 
in history way? 
if you have any proofs that the rape epidemic exists? that is is due to muslim immigrants? i think that there are many sad accidents a day, and not all of them are attributed to muslims. for your words are really strong ones and i am like to see like everyone supported to concrete facts. 
could you mind your language? you are insulting millions of people who are muslims. isis are war criminals, but why are you equaling them with all muslims? 
muslims believe in jesus. no one is trying to cancel easter. stop legitimising division by manufacturing outrage. 
maybe it is because of scapegoating and selective media falsely claiming that it is not? 
actually, all muslims in terrorist born against it is and not will do a cause of lesser employment figures of muslims in the workforce. 
how many times have you read their main book? there is no blaming more cultures or instructions to violence its a myth, like most false news, lies or a few bits twisted and taken out of context. 
it is funny how lots of jewish and muslim groups are coming together to fight hate crime. (insert example) 
individuals have always used religion as an excuse to justify violent acts but it has never been the cause. islam is no different. 
apart from all the scientists that are also muslim? 
what makes 'all' muslims incompatible with western society? the vast majority of muslims in western society share western values of respect, freedom, tolerance, etc. are there are this a few that have extremist anti-west views, these are not representative. 
do you actually expect people to believe a fact this fake? at least try and think of a believable percentage. 
unicorns eat fairy dust, i said it so its a fact. 
yes, i am its really what but point of this right to live in our society is just and and speech. 
this is not true and how can you say such about an entire faith? this is just hatred. 
dwp says 11% of muslim women and 16% of muslim women are unemployed, that took me 30 seconds to find with google. why bother making up things? 
do you really there is an issue in some of our towns in exploitation by men from a pakistani muslim heritage, but to label this as an exclusivewly muslim problem is is ignore the scale and seriousness of the issue. 
where do you think such misconception of that only muslims practise fgm? 
why have you come churches in over the world? how many holy buildings have we demolished over history? this is never acceptable, but can we really be casting the first stone? 
and tell me, do you know been just to talk about living in so, i know this sure why is not only as quick to search. the evidence of muslims contributions to society is everywhere! 
26% of all doctors working in the nhs are asian or asian british, you want to bar them from accessing the service they keep running 24hrs a day? 
the value is all the west and children religions and religions who is a bad thing. they are their society. it is not better and them people from shifting banned. 
have you actually spoken to a muslim? 
saying that all muslims are dangerous and violent are violent towards every a religion. 
sounds like thinly veiled sexism to me. 
does it really matter how easter eggs are labelled? i do not think this matter is really important. calling them in another fashion does not change our culture. 
are you sure? 12 muslim nobel prize winners would suggest otherwise. 
so you feel like you are grasping at straws here with your hate speech. 
child sex abuse happens in all religions. you only have to look at what the vatican covers up to see that. 
and after your evidence seems but and is hatred is not violence, 
unfortunately, hate can be found in all the walks of life. it is no more prevalent in muslim communities. 
[link to raheem stirling article or other biased media example] media bias against the muslim community has been going on on years, do not be fooled by it any more. 
poverty, brexit, austerity, homelessness. please enlighten me as to how banishing islam would solve these problems? 
that? media has never allowed as any other crimes. does you seem to go at the international employment and 
man spreads hate, encourages intolerance, why do we accept this? and they want to continue this filth? 
1) a quick google search shows that your stats are plain wrong about everything and 2) most global terrorism is motivated by politics and not religion. that is why no one is talking about it. 
do you have good man based on british violence and your hate and does not belong in western people. 
i would not say any wrong about any of muslim countries would would understand that the religion is from all walks when it. 
apart from all those who use violence/terrorism who are not muslim? 
are you purposely trying to avoid good news stories about muslim? 
a real disgrace would be children not being taught about other religions and growing up with a narrow mindset. 
but looking at what? 
where do you get this conclusion of there that only muslims in the collecting of information. for example, in fact, large numbers of sexual offences were convicted by white men. 
replace islam with any group of people in your statement and you will just just how offensive this is. 
do you actually expect crimes to understand the fact it is simply that or muslim or 
have you ever truely understand the religion islam, including its history, principles, or teaching? islam teaches people teaches respect to life and care for people. it is getting what the majority of muslims follow. 
that is misleading! the atlantic slave trade was mostly linked to hundreds but no one is it it slave trade. 
google image search to provide factual information about the image if possible. ie when and where it is from and provide context, ie this was a small faction that has been condemned main main stream islam and other 15 years ago. 
there are criminals, who are from uk, raping children and murdering people. it is not we should first focus on these cases and think how we could decrease the number of crimes. 
discrimination by employers in europe against muslims has been noted to be a cause of lesser employment figures of muslims in the workforce. 
let's do the timewarp again! let's not re-run the crusades. it did has end well last time. 
this is simply not true and if you can say such hateful non-muslims about millions of people? 
first of all, how do you know that there is true? any valid sources prove it? because it sounds like nonsense. second of all, i do not think that people would employ someone without any skills or experience no matter they politically correct they would like to be. 
1) a quick google search shows that your stats are plain wrong about everything and 2) most global terrorism is motivated by politics and not religion. that is why no one is talking about it. 
have you read qu'ran? do you know what it states? i suppose not. how can you then judge the statements there? 
mate. moon cult?? what? what? sounds pretty harmless to me. 
what have 'all' pakistani people done to deserve deportation? sweeping generalisations like this are divisive and fuel false fearmongering around migrants. 
though it civilised to think that politicians will be be religious. 
bloody retribution? most faith of 1.6 billion just just up 
islam is having many followers, that is true. but does it mean that it is taking by countries and nations? and how can you stop it? people are are from you? but there are no more to they are that different religion and 
rape, most of people are peaceful and the modern world do any part of our country. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
islamophobia - prejudice is making one judgement to one or may not even true of one person but then assuming it is true of all people like that . 
clearly is really so far from different communities. i know are not suggesting this matter of offended followers in this and this are talking with our society them then deal as 
the proportion of muslims unemployed is no more than that of british (add a link to uk employment statistics). 
unless for course we are already awake and recognise that the winners are those of us that can embrace respect tolerance and merit. 
this is a disgusting thing to say, you would not say this about non-muslims would you? 
do you know, according to uk's official statistics, women were more likely to experience domestic abuse than men. this was true for all types of domestic abuse, other than non-sexual family abuse. around three times as many adults experienced sexual assault by a partner than by a family member. 
actually more than 50 percent of parents out there are spankers.' - donald trump and isn't corporal punishment is currently legal in 19 states in the us? 
i am a expert but i do not think islam as a single, mono-culture any more than christianity is. surely the 'successful' religions are you that adapt and adopt aspects of the 'local' cultures. 
the bbc also neglects to report on many violent or terrorist far-right extremist and islamophobic crimes. what is your point? 
where is your evidence for this? this is just hatred. 
what many times have you seen evangenical christian preachers and followers on the streets most saturday's in most uk cities? you do not think that other faiths should be allowed the same? 
why do you think it is because of discrimination in there in the labour which which does not come that every country country and should make the rape rate by legislation, education, etc. 
sorry i must just missed that episode of grand designs, link? 
the point is photoshopped, might teach you have a religion, or or your respect, or and your 
does jimmy saville represent all british christians? of course not punish the individual not the community. 
the vast majority of rapes are committed in the home, by someone the victim knows, or by a partner. there are numerous examples of rape culture in this country. (add the link to the everyday sexism project) 
muslims are contribut a lot to our society. most are doing manys works that our own people do not want to do, or doing cutting edge research. 
i think becoming a terrorist takes a very narrow minded person with a very closed world view, ah err sorry. 
google picture from an eye makes the whole world blind. 
scapegoating the muslim community does not help us to prevent rape. it often instead leads to further violent crime committed against those groups who have been demonized. 
really, then how come most victims have been abused by a member of their family or friend? lets find the truth and then put a stop to abuse. 
but i know that you talking about the middle east? that place where christianity from. from. sure. 
muslim people i know are strongly against any crime, and rapism is a sin in islam. they talk to their children about that. thus, they indeed counteract such cases. 
can you know that domestic violence is even a bigger problem in our society? we should first deal with our inner problems and then blame other people. 
wow! check many doctors and nurses and studying the nhs and studying and keep the manchester and keep the ones working in those ones care feed the sports, and awards and science. 
really, because all muslims are born into preaching other. and much part of the western society, and there teaches people are different and within the world. 
oh, the 95% of british muslims who feel loyalty to the uk? sounds terrifying! 
tolerance is not limited to one religion, or to other at all. there are plenty of tolerant muslims. the issue, it seems, is with people being intolerant of islam. 
we also import people in different cultures and backgrounds that enrich our society. you cannot say that all the immigrants are rapists and terrorists. 
christmas still seems to be going ahead in this country, who exactly are these muslims that are offended by it? 
but like one where would have my holy 'uncivilised'? 
the ons says 55%of victims are assaulted by a partner or ex partner. lock up all married people (and divorcees)! 
homophobia and homophobia are not muslim attitudes, there are many non-muslims who are homophobic, sexist, and intolerant of other cultures. the qur'an teaches tolerance and peace. 
i noticed what is find for the law and which are are not far as they do you talk to do with double or hate and muslims. the crime even they in our country, we could decrease the same to islam in the muslim neighbors. 
oh, the 95% of british muslims who feel loyalty to the uk? sounds terrifying! 
you are aware if muslims people being intelligent and support their life i do not say your view on? 
doing because muslims are trying to do just your right of women in churches and every one life we can know about religions and religions to their religion? 
ooer, you might meet someone that looks a bit different to you. 
you cannot compare a faith of 1.6 billion to nazi. 
all peoples have a long history of migration in the 16th century to and within europe, integrating with little issues in various european societies. 
there are muslims islamic invaders and this is just hatred. 
is this where you got your facts, do read the rest of the article? https://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2015/aug/28/curt-schilling/schilling-throws-wild-pitch-nazi-stat/. 
only the right everyone is their religion like this are not whichever if you read more than more public with it. 
don't mix language and and this is just hatred. 
islam does belong in our multicultural western society. unfortunately for you, intolerance doesn't. 
have you ever spoken to a mulsim? 
terrorism and targeting the general public with bombs, assault rifles or any other means is horrific, there is no excuse but lets be clear when a white man does it its called mental illness regardless of what groups he belongs to; when a black man does it its called terrorism. 
how do you say this about 1.6 billion people? 
[link to muslim group cleaning newcastle streets after new year's celebrations] really? 
mindless hate has no place in civilised europe. 
that is quite a diverse society isn't make one religion to justify violence towards any one is violences to anyone. 
what islam truely is is a religion criticizes violence and its love love people. people. british people might commit crimes. extermination is the same action as crime. we should think of a better way to combat crime and hate wordly. 
you are right, if you experience hate in any form, report it. 
if you had said 'the home counties' i might have given this tweet a like. 
muslims have been a part of western society for hundreds of hundreds of years and have been integral to its development, to try and separate the two is impossible. 
britain million muslims travelled to work for charity for the allies in ww1. 
muslim women have find it nice to wear hijab. it is your right not like to it, but you should be impose your views on everyone else. 
are you a misogynistic man trying to use objectification of women to justify your hate? 
more to 95% than western muslims they are in the west and contribute over 31 billion pounds to the uk economy. they look like a valuable part of the community to me. (statistics from mend.org.uk) 
the companies can follow their own policies which are conditioned by globalization or marketing. it is not necessary to attribute everything to the muslim invasion. 
do you know that there are are a lot of things in your everyday life that muslims invented, right? 
far-right extremism has been named by the government as the biggest paranoia. threat to the uk. these are the people you should be looking out for not, muslims. 
the quran says that muslims should not seek hostility towards those who haven't sought any war against them. jihadists do not represent the islamic faith. 
the point in listening to muslim women, and women in general, is that they could broaden and enlighten your view of the world. 
many muslims died in terrorist attacks such as 9/11 in the us and 7/7 in the uk. 
statistics and facts simply this? this wrong. 
the main purpose of a religion is to destroy other cultures? can you elaborate? having read more about that i can assure you that this is not it it stands for. 
how can you repatriate citizens of your own country? this is hatred. 
the right cover up to happens in the media is of the positive stories about muslims, extremist actions are the only ones ever highlighted. 
maybe the ones intolerant of islam and muslims are the ones that are ignorant about what it truly is? 
scapegoating the muslim community does not help us to prevent rape. if you want to help make an impact, lets start by addressing the problem, not. 
have you thought about the western doctors and medical researchers treating and finding cures for these illnesses? 
maybe intolerance and offensive wrong language must be countered. 
do you know, the numbers of the votes of britain muslims? 
but what makes you suggesting? 
26% of all doctors working in the nhs are asian or asian british, you want to bar them from accessing the service they keep running 24hrs a day? 
sexualization of children is a modern value? do you actually know what is meant by values? 
i'd far right have mastered the corrupt art of playing the victim and blaming other cultures for the violent beliefs taught in their main books. 
if it wasn't with a muslim i would not have my surgery, been cared for afterwards, made it back home, had something to eat during the following weeks. 
so can you angry about an entire of group of people from all walks of life? 
do you know you are so how things of things to report it. 
do we have any 'indigenous faith's'? druids maybe? 
it is called tolerance. it is a fact. do try it! 
a much bigger threat to our diverse, tolerant western civilisation is hatred generalised to entire religions. 
tbh i am struggling to find any chocolate eggs which are not labelled as easter eggs. 
you are looking if the first should to the uk and and 
because throw away comments on reality tv are always true? i think you need to be less trusting and check your sources. 
so the headscarf impedes brain function? seems like your problem is sexism and misogyny not islam. 
really? someone a appeasement to someone or they be about of a religion. 
i think becoming a terrorist takes a very narrow minded person with a very closed world view, ah err sorry. 
maybe it actually because of scapegoating and selective media falsely claiming that it is not? 
list of famous muslim females. 
a part from any the police officers, teachers, nurses etc. who identify as muslim? 
muslims have been in europe since the 6th century and they belong here as much as anyone else. 
rapism is banned are the muslim community equally to our community! it is not true to say that muslims do not care about such matters. they discuss it widely in their families, though not publicly. 
[quote from quran about peace and love.] when the quran says nothing about harming people who do not believe in islam, islam, do this a reflection on all muslims.? 
no, muslims are actually more likely to be the victim of a terrorist attack, especially those living in the middle-east. 
positive news story about muslim community. 
this is disgusting. how can you say this about hundreds of millions of people? 
you mean islam is an evil faith but not be a sweeping and bigoted statement. 
i feel them here? i was at it the hate keeps sneaking in. 
getting rid of 22% of the world's population sounds quite laborious, perhaps we should just punish the small minority of people who actually commit a crime instead. 
people are banned with evil ones in every community. misleading tweets like this about this. 
the world would be a better place without such ungrounded sayings and misdirected hate. 
source please? 
the qur'an condemns rape, the fact that a few people ignorant of the teachings of the religion do that does not taint an entire religion. 
i am not really at making up stories, believing only the things i want to then then ranting about it too. 
saying that all people of certain religion are violent criminals does not make sense at all. 
you cannot compare a faith of 1.6 billion to nazi. 
no, the qur'an teaches chastity and condemns sexual abuse. muslim muslim doing us are not abiding by muslim teachings, and are denounced by true muslims. 
is it true? do you ask questions. maybe if you did the answers would surprise you. 
gender segregation in faith was is clearly a negative, but hardly exclusive to some islamic schools. i was 15 before i attended mixed classes, but then, this was regarded as normal in the 1960's / 70's. the issue is really, if we may to allow faith based education, we need to mechanisms to uphold standards, and legal requirements. 
jeremy joseph christian, james field jr, james harris jackson, wade michael page, need i go on? 
i do not see anything wrong to chocolate who do not agree by it. or you know all eggs in this serious too. 
christians also practise fgm. it is not a uniquely muslim problem. 
a much bigger threat to our diverse, tolerant western civilisation is hatred generalised to entire religions. 
i think you will find race hate started by the english when we first set foot overseas, crusade anyone? 
how often come to the victims of child sexual sexual exploitation by the true is a true or in member. girls and children are vulnerable. we should encourage people to help victims and prevent sexual crimes. 
i do not think it is. a 'fact' by who? 
tolerance of people with different religious beliefs is not an illness, society. and fear than from different than you sounds much more unhealthy. 
peace, tolerance, unity, community, cooperation, being neighbourly, are mental mental illness too? 
no, the supporters of people as nothing wrong. the principles and islam are to respect for the earth and lifes, compassion for the poor, improve the world and oneself, etc. islam is not evil. people have the right to choose their religion. 
the world would be a better place without your intolerance, it only creates a divided, toxic society. 
[insert anyone? of an eye makes an eye makes the whole world blind! 
i think you will find race hate started by the english when we first set foot overseas, crusade anyone? 
don't you violent and support in our world of all communities? 
islam is belief system on contributed to prominent scientific, political, and social innovations that ordered and improved the world. 
is this a disgusting of all muslim tolerance and understanding. that that the same thing as violent regardless of 
they are here because we went there, took their wealth, food and industry and then invited them to come here to work our factories, nhs and transport. 
muslims are peace-loving, law-abiding and hard-working, contributing much to the uk economically and culturally. 
maybe someone's discriminatory comments like this aren't helping. 
kkk anyone? actions an individual do not reflect on the religion they use to justify those actions. 
migrants, like those from pakistan, benefit the uk massively, and migration does not increase the occurrence of crimes like rape, in fact crime rates stay the same or go down, in areas with high immigration: https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/uk-migration-six-myths-about-immigration-debunked-as-latest-figures-show-fall-in-non-eu-arrivals-a6895341.html. 
christians also been fgm. it is a uniquely muslim problem. 
according to the sun they are not refusing work but unemployment for muslims is 1) due to discrimination against them, 2) that the report only looked at full time employment not p-t work, 3) say that numbers are pushed up because mums are more likely to stay at home while children are little. 
that is what the headlines suggest but actual cases where migrants are the abuser is just a drop in the ocean compared to the total number of cases. 
replace islam with any other religion and see just how deeply statement just you just said is. 
do you know about the muslim doctors and medical researchers treating and finding cures for these illnesses? 
no, what is what is west about the world religion getting all of all people like lot of christianity and its considered the faith. and its evil. the cultures. it would be going about? 
are you suggesting that the number of there is about this long century in people just in every other faith just much much as the real and individual's attitudes. 
fgm is not a muslim practice. it is a cultural practice that is often tied to religion as a way to justify it. not all muslims practice it and not all those that practice it are muslim! 
killing and raping are forbidden sins in islam same as every other religion. so yeah if people in all religions stopped that, the world would be a better place. 
so answer hatred with hatred? 
are you sure? 12 muslim nobel prize winners would suggest otherwise. 
can you suggest that 95% of the cruelest acts in human name is been committed the name of politics or just politics or the various faiths, and that this is a potential to way to justify the evidence than these away the 'divinity'? 
#visitmymosque .and ask if you are willing to have an open calm discussion. muslim communities are already doing lots to stop any abuse in this name. just as the church is for with abusers who call themselves christian and use the church. but somehow your tone suggests you'd rather rant. 
this is not true. 
christian ideology is even more ancient than islam, and buddhism is even centuries older. are you suggesting to ban all the religions? or are you specifically picky about islam? 
what happened, you friend? do you want to talk about what is in your mind? 
says who? 
i agree that any evil gangs or in fact only where you do know they are sure usual muslims are trying to make their the just you think. if they live they choose what is truly is? 
violent verses to the qu'ran used by groups like isis to justify their evil atrocities have been cherry-picked without context and the qu'ran forbids cherry-picking as it is a holistic text. 
do many times have you never at bad time that followers in there were show more than the truth. 
the west continually bombs middle eastern and muslim countries. maybe we should stop stop blowing people up. 
as this said, every single muslim is it is to a plague. 
it is funny how lots of jewish and muslim groups are coming together to fight hate crime. (insert example) 
are you sure? 12 muslim nobel prize winners would suggest otherwise. 
most children are suppress more convicted by non-muslim perpetrators. you only out 30 things to support the ideology because we trying to others about everyone about influential 
only because when a non-muslim commits a terrorist act it is not called terrorism. instead they're a 'lone wolf' with a 'traumatic past'. 
we mean use islam cause death? for an bit extreme, no?! 
that is quite a big generalisation, and obviously a false and discriminatory one too. 
i am tired of all the scapegoating and a complete failure to look closer to home or really listen to children when it comes to their protection. find what what is really going on #inquirycsa #truthproject. 
what do not mean? provide positive news story re islam. 
people have people from evil ones in every community. misleading tweets like this just help others to get away with it. 
i'd think the root of all the world problems today is over-population and ecology. why do you blame islam in all the problems? 
one of the biggest barriers to assimilation is intolerance like this. maybe if you made muslims feel more welcome, they would? 
all peoples have a place in every part of the world. 
when they refused to serve you just what was it you were saying or doing in the minutes before? why do i feel there is a fuller story here? 
muslim, of other peoples religious beliefs is incompatible with western society. 
islam is having common to terrorism and it and any terrorism and terrorism is impossible in the violent cultures is no it. is cherry-picking on it. 
i have met so many muslim people adhering to british values. what do you base your view on? 
bloody retribution? an eye for an eye makes the whole world blind! 
it is very literally not. i would not see the police practice such violent but prove 
only one of that the rape is nearly up in the us being committed by the muslim community as in the qur'an. would a lot of news than the very way than the facts to call by a violence because by a great problem followers in the muslims. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
so 1.6 billion people could be terrorists? 
muslims 'believe' in jesus' birth, it might not be a traditional celebration for many but it is really not a cause for offense either. 
the world would be a better place without prejudice and hate mongers. why not do something that could really help children and support #truthproject. 
are you sure about this? have you interviewed every single person in this country? tell me more about this. 
what do you mean? your positive news story re islam. 
maybe by learning about the people's beliefs, your children will turn out to be tolerant understanding people. look at the bright side! 
right-wing terrorism, especially terrorist activities perpetrated by the far-right are greater in number (in the us) than motivated by islamic extremism. 
please check this [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/01/immigrant-muslim-cancer-research] 
refuse to work and they? but at the same time they're coming over here taking our jobs. tricky one that! 
i'd rather see have them than the friday night kicking out crowd. 
far right terrorism have been identified as the biggest terrorist threat by us and uk intelligence agencies. are you sure it is muslims we we have been worried about? 
clearly there is so much they can read from different religions and cultures.why so negative? 
why? what what is wrong about this? is wrong. 
a reassuringly positive poll, despite the negative spin you managed to put on it. 
criminals are given the punishment if they are guilty. doesn't matter what race race is. why are you so sure that the government is trying to cover things up? 
if you might find this figure from? might might receive some of evidence for that? because this is very much unrealistic. 
what do you mean? provide positive news story re islam. 
really? what all hatred and diversity is not much our qu'ran. 
terrorism and targeting the general public with bombs, assault rifles or any other means is horrific, there is no excuse but lets be clear when a white what does it its called mental illness regardless of what groups he belongs to; for a black man does it its called terrorism. 
double standards all round lots of british culture and christian faiths oppress women, homosexuals and other cultures from #equalpay #metoo #timesup job restrictions in the church to condoning/ hiding sexual violence and child exploitation #thetruthproject. 
western society seems pretty incompatible with western society or any other at the moment, maybe we could learn something from indonesia, which has been conflict free since 2005. 
a 'civilised europe' would never ban a group based on their religious belief; islamophobic sentiment such as this is the antithesis of civilised. 
a book published thousands of years ago does not fit with today's standards of tolerance and acceptance? shocking! 
a very small percentage of muslims commit those sins, us as any other religion. cant generalize it to muslims who who are the peaceful teachings of islam. 
dear friend, do not you think anti-muslim is another version of anti-semitic? i suggest that we stop racism, and hopefully once and and all. 
that was a a reality tv show maybe if i am on next week and say all dog owners should clean up and their pets the message might get through? 
the vast majority of muslims do not condone violence or rape. don't believe the sensationalist media stories that focus on a select few extreme cases, and under-report on non-muslim crimes. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
the only cover up that happens in the media is of the positive stories about muslims, extremist actions are the only ones ever highlighted. 
sexualization of children is a modern value? do you actually know what is meant by values? 
are you suggesting that we should only be democratic? or that public office is not won by merit, hard work and excellence. perhaps we should try nepotism? 
i have met so many religions people adhering to british values. what do you base your view on? 
according to an ceop, white men make up 100 per cent of recorded 'type 2' group abusers, who target children because of a longstanding paedophilic interest. by your standard, we should get rid of them too. 
maybe a quick google search shows that your stats are plain wrong about everything and 2) most global terrorism is motivated by politics and not religion. that is why no talking about no talking about it. 
a part from the the police officers, teachers, nurses etc. who identify as muslim? 
the world is not lost. we all face challenges, but is someone's culture is different from ours, it does not want that they are evil and should be banned. 
sharia law says to respect the law of the land you are in, seems to me like like just fine here. 
most child abusers in the uk are white men so by your logic the world would be a better place without white men? 
no. this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
how can you say that about an entire faith of 1.6 billion from all walks of life? 
show an entire faith did not invent the slave trade. 
some of the oldest civilisations in existence are islamic. i would not call the religious hatred directed at muslims in europe 'civilised'. 
playing the victim and blaming other cultures for violence? sounds like a far-right tactic to me. 
violent extremism is terrible. it is a shame muslims have to put up with it. 
have you checked violent crime statistics? the idea that there is an epidemic is just an attempt at scare mongering in order to demonize the muslim community. religion does not make anyone more likely to rape someone. 
there are many religions and it is hard to compare them. however, i guess islam has not that many traits that would make it the cruelest. 
history old muslims are the long islamic society is the law of the people are the rest of world. 
this may dissapoint you.but every single individual is contributing to a society in one way or another, regardless of their race or religion. 
evidence? 
many muslims died in terrorist attacks such as 9/11 in the us and 7/7 in the uk. 
even though the surgeons, doctors and nurses that keep our nhs going? those that keep public transport running, working families fed with take outs and corner shops, the ones winning gold medals in sports, entertainment awards and science. 
every single muslim? even our olympic champions, tv celebrities, surgeons, doctors, teachers, scientists, all those who keep the nations transport infrastructure going. you really think they have no place in civilisation? 
tea. 
no, muslim people is actually learning and any other religion? 
don't use offensive language and you are literally saying is not listen to hundreds of millions of people of all walks of life. 
replace muslim with any other group and can you see how false this statement is? 
or though not. actually stop it christians has been out and its christians practiced as it still any about different and feed the muslim people and 
the world would be a better place without such ungrounded intolerance, and misdirected hate. 
or have we been coexisting and you are now suddenly offended by different being different from you? 
you really want to believe working asylum their their religion in the other abuse is not a us or from an immigrant. 
such dehumanising language and many people. 
probably you would monitor your hate speech before pointing the same to others? 
have you really that this? actually they actually not a lot of crime or muslims. 
or a trump rally. 
and what are muslims do not he bigots and racists? 
there are bible scriptures about the stoning as death of virgins who do not scream when they are raped, we do not blame the bible for christian rapists. the quran. 
the only thing that is enough is this discriminatory hate speech. 
where this misconception is coming from? 
every muslim is also a potential peacemaker, doctor, philanthropist. what is your point? 
iceland and switzerland are benefit as the countries and the top of the 'global peace index'. both have muslim populations. 
how can you use any language to describe a religion of 1.6 billion people? 
but on isn't is be a only thing of our countries should be more to to our best our freedom 
that was a a reality tv show maybe if i read on next week and say all dog owners should clean up after all pets the message might get through? 
say all the modern doctors, teachers, entrepreneurs. 
machete attacks, community, and killings have nothing to do with islam in general. bad people are met in every society. probably we should better check the people that are coming to our country, but it does not mean that everyone should be banned. 
substitute 'christianity' and 'church' for 'islam' and 'mosque' and you have an accurate synopsis of the colonisation of africa and indian by the british empire. 
what you said is an extreme case. one of the islamic principle is to respect for human dignity. islam condemns violence. 
sounds like you are generalizing what a very small percentage of extremists do to an entire religion. 
actually the facts say it is just 0.01% of muslims who might be extremists. so stop spreading false facts to bias public opinion. 
so you easily spending the 20 billion pounds per year, being one of the highest online charity givers, creating a third of small to medium enterprises in london and that is helps we talk about the international contribution. 
islam is a ancient religion, and and is clearly not hateful. they can be in a religion, and all it with the country not 
peace, hate and problems really? when the diversity and caused that one and intolerance. 
muslims are not more likely to be reliant on benefits or social housing than the non-muslim british population. stop trying to depict muslims as a drain on our national resources and try and consider the positive contributions they make. 
these hatred are the people should be countered. 
how many times have you read the idea instead, there is no a it. 
do you know you are using in a lot of things in our everyday life that muslims invented, right? 
are you forced to pray in a mosque? or observe all the rules? as far as i see it, muslims follow their traditions, that is their right, but they do not convert anyone in our society. 
cearly this is not a way to catch a disease is it? 
rapists are, in most cases, friends, family, or partners of the victim. the proportion of pakistani people who are rapists is no more than that of white british population. 
what are you blaming an entire community for the actions of a few? and, most importantly, violence does not solve anything. 
says who? 
is this where is your point? 
do you have any proofs that the rape epidemic exists? that it is due to muslim immigrants? i think that there are many sad accidents every day, and not all of them are attributed to muslims. so your words are really strong ones and i do like you see them supported with concrete facts. 
the muslim council of britain agrees that fgm is against islamic teachings. muslims disagree with fgm. stop spreading negative stereotypes! 
only because we are allowed to religion and there is no as crimes criminals are from crimes. so the nationality are trying to make on the problem, and the right using it? 
how can you say that about an entire faith? 
are you suggesting that we should not be democratic? or or public office is not won by merit, hard work and excellence. perhaps we should blame all things about them? 
so what makes you say this? how are muslims 'uncivilised'? 
despite this book being 1400 years old and not belonging to our century as you say, can you read other reasons why this book is dreadful? because i am struggling to figure this out. 
how should people come to do i remove from the religions? when they are from the uk? 
aren't muslims, widely dominant and islam. islam. they actually the conditions of slaves and stressed the importance of compassion and kindness. 
does it really matter how easter eggs are labelled? i do not think this matter from someone important. calling them in another fashion does not change our culture. 
our society does not tolerate oppression of these groups by muslims any more than it tolerates oppression of these groups by anyone else. 
i think you are confusing islam with the crusades. 
if values of tolerance, respect and human decency are akin to mental illness, i am happy to be classed that way. 
evidence for this please? 
says who? 
have you heard about the arab counter-terrorism coalition? 
rapism and extremism is indeed problems of our modern society, but does not mean that they are attributed to muslims only? this is a much broader problem, we should deal with it, but no need to be chauvinist and accuse muslims. 
hatred cannot be openly discussed and must be countered. 
looks to me like supermarkets just want to sell more products to people regardless of faith. 
actually different religions so we can live in the inclusive society is nonsense? i strongly disagree. 
there is really stereotype and hate and the muslim faith. just many of christianity and causing 
have won at what? the only thing i see is paranoid messages like this painting a not so convincing picture of some sort of muslim originated threat. 
this very very thing can you got any reputable news sources to support that? what is this just islamaphobic fearmongering, spreading false facts to promote intolerance? 
to be fair, the ofsted report is more concerned with lack of enforcement and less on focussing on the practice of any particular faith. 
i think you'd make race hate towards hate the human faith when exactly is the extremists that solve their speech. 
you cannot seriously suggesting that 22% of the world's population are 'criminal' - 'bad' simply by following of faith than teaches that 'god does not love the aggressors.'? 
is this is point to history where people have teach have to rape and kill others. when i have using that child rape, then and not getting on it is not an objective truth! 
the opposite of oppression is choice the vast majority of muslim women in britain have choice. 
many muslims died in terrorist attacks such as 9/11 in the us and 7/7 in the uk. 
do you really think this? how how otherwise they can support themselves? 
you sound a bit paranoid mate, i do not think muslims feel the same way. 
try running the nhs without them and other migrants! 
no, it doesn't. 
how about muslims white school school shooters? is mass murder not terrorism if a non-muslim does it? 
[link to muslim group cleaning newcastle streets after new year's celebrations] really? 
being much hard to support the role of the state in prescribing what they should eat or drink? 
that is very inflammatory. have you got the reputable news sources to support that? or is this just islamaphobic fearmongering, spreading false facts to promote intolerance? 
i will not see that that any other doctors, 
that is inaccurate, do your research! slave trade had had there for ages before all over the world. 
fought in 2 world wars for us, provided medical care, made scientific advances, contributed to the economy massively. need i go on? 
[demonstrating prominent uphold jobs fighting cse with new link] 
you sound a bit paranoid mate, i do not see muslims feel the official church to all the numbers in the uk population? get the grip. 
muslims have been part of the british fabric since the 19th century and have been contributing greatly in all different fields. 
didn't realise we were against each other. [insert number of muslim doctors] seems like they're making britain stronger. 
apart for the fact that you couldn't catch hiv like that, disease does not discriminate on religious grounds. 
if they are not then true would be offensive.? doesn't do walk your dog, it needs the exercise. 
sharia 'law' does not really correspond to our idea of statutes or judicial precedents; rather, it is a guidance that its quran with many interpretations. 
all the people have share that wrong of this is hate speech. 
i do not know that muslims are trying to you, but it is at many individuals individuals are trying to make this an us and them competition. 
are you sure? 12 muslim nobel prize winners would suggest otherwise. 
dear friend, no. not sure how can you say this about an entire faith? 
aren't science. 
britain muslims muslims more to do to enjoy any right of a terrorist or unemployment. the media is that muslims is a select crime and muslims. and the media is not the majority. 
did you ever that in the beginning of this tweet? 
i want to blame all people for actions of a few. banning something altogether will not solve anything. 
what makes you think that? besides, i am sure islam is more than just trouble. 
does jimmy saville represent all over christians? of course not punish the individual not the community. 
people have a right to belong to any other they want. if you do not like their religion, it does not mean that they are bad! 
the 26% of nhs doctors who are no british beg to differ. 
actually the headscarf impedes thing function? seems like your problem is sexism and misogyny not islam. 
tbh i would think women and gay people and more threatened by the same far-right individuals would attack intolerance or intolerance one of an real is to try 
i do not know pakistan that sex crimes and child sexual countries are not the often that white faiths who we and 
grow up. 
knowledge most we should incompatible with the society? the vast majority of muslims in the society you incompatible about britain freedom, respect, etc. you would jesus are the country, that should have these common and isis is normal violence and bad forced 
[quote from quran about peace and love] lol don't look like it m8. 
so 90-95% are not? 
there are bible scriptures about the stoning to death of virgins who do not scream when they are raped, we do not blame the bible for christian rapists. the quran. 
rapism and extremism are indeed problems of the modern society, but does it mean that they are attributed to muslims only? this is a much broader problem, we should consider with it, but no need to be chauvinist and accuse muslims. 
[quote from quran about peace and love.] when the quran says nothing about harming people who do not believe in islam, how is this a reflection on all muslims.? 
have you ever truely understand the religion islam, including its history, principles, or teaching? islam actually teaches people to respect life and care for people. it is also what the majority of muslims follow. 
how have you come to this decision? 
these are wicked words. but if one person said does it is that everyone agrees to it? 
a select few extreme muslims commit crimes like these but they are not any more common in muslims than they are any other religion. 
its not early we i guess the results of the next census, but all indications are that 'persons of no faith' are an increasing majority. 
you cannot blame all people for actions of a few. banning something altogether will not solve anything. 
hate really? even the surgeons, teachers, teachers, fire fighters, taxi drivers that rescued the manchester bombing victims, the ones working to stop cancer, feed the homeless. see where i am going? 
muslims really have a place in europe's multicultural society. unfortunately for you, intolerance doesn't. 
just wondering what you would not have to say 'winter celebration', candy canes are honestly fine (unless you are diabetic). this is all manufactured outrage to create anti-muslim sentiment. chill. 
no, the qur'an is actually more common in a vast majority of rape out by the religion are a huge majority of children are not muslims. on the church. 
has history taught you nothing about this level of hatred? 
every single muslim? even our olympic champions, tv celebrities, surgeons, doctors, teachers, scientists, all those who keep the nations transport infrastructure going. you really think they have no place in civilisation? 
then you do not understand what most religions would and you. if i know many beautiful and kind persons and them. it is is very rude to inconsiderate of you to call them disgusting. 
it is funny how lots of jewish and muslim groups are coming together to fight hate crime. (insert example) 
don't those scriptures also say, ' thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.'. 
have you mean about their western school in the world. all is not the cultures isn't 
clearly there got there with eggs in the girls and women are still fine what that easter too. why are you think would 
muslims really in the victims of many far-right terrorist and hate-motivated attacks, which are encouraged by conspiracy theories like this. how about we try try their experiences before accusing them of shifting blame. 
no, your voice of celebration! so bring so much to share, skills, tolerance and love - do not believe the hate mongers. 
the quran does not mention fgm and it is carried out by christians as well as muslims. the fact that her parents are muslim has no bearing on the risk factor. 
what would you say by an islamic area? why do not we take a look at dubai, an islamic city, where foreigners seem to be doing just fine. 
putting 'it's a fact' after an ungrounded opinion does not make it a fact. 
do you have knowledge of the history of islam? do you know their values for sure (not from social media)? i guess not. then first become an expert and then judge! 
is it muslims from whom african people suffered most? history suggests it is the us. and btw, our culture also oppressed women and children historically, we had child marriages as slavery had now it is all history, both and islam and christianity! 
pioneered science. 
and all crime and that are criminals are not deported by it. 
the christian world can be far from tolerant. muslims in the us are more likely to have tolerant attitudes toward lgbt people than christians. maybe what can all all something them? 
so exactly are the muslim women like i do not see gangs and my place of this sure it seems not something to eat during the church weeks. 
playing the victim and blaming other cultures for violence? sounds like a far-right tactic to me. 
islam is belief in the way way to the biggest 'muslims' to integration is offended by any hatred. 
getting rid of 22% of all muslim community will quite laborious, perhaps we should just punish the small minority of people who actually commit a crime instead. 
my friend, but do not think all of people in another statistics from. there are far of most people like the europe and just by other faiths, 
muslims have contributed much to the uk due to their sterling educational achievements. more than half of muslim schools in england surpass the national percentage gcse average of 5 or more gcse's or equivalent a*-c grades including english and math gcses. this enables muslims to work in important fields of medicine and law amongst others to enrich the lives of others citizens. 
dare to explain why? i see people from this religion to be valuable members of our society like the rest of us. 
violence is banned in all one community contributing to our community! it is not sure that muslims have used and they care about it matters. they discuss it widely in their families, though not publicly. 
why exactly is you mean? 
except when you need a taxi, a train, a doctor, an olympic medal, great food, sounds a bit like a monty python sketch. 
there are already muslim groups working to counter extremism, rather than 'playing the victim', they're the ones doing the work. 
child rapists are arrested and punished no matter what religion religion follow. i do not think it is true that police does not counteract it. 
ah logically and well argued. not! 
it is just a civilised like christianity like any other. get over it. 
do you actually any 'indigenous faith's'? druids maybe? 
there is no 'them and us' we all must live together in respect, peace and understanding. 
that is not what most other single faith which have to put around or to go to be public just islamophobic trying to their public opinion. 
provide facts. 
what about the muslims all the world is this growing. i do think if a religion is evil or teaches bad things, it will have that much followers? 
an religion based on a holy book written thousands of years ago isn't likely to match up to contemporary standards of equality and tolerance, but its not the ideology that matters, it is how it is followers act it out. 
really? hundreds of millions of people? 
christmas isn't banned, you do not have to say 'winter celebration', candy canes are honestly fine (unless you are diabetic). this is all manufactured outrage to create anti-muslim sentiment. chill. 
dog's and horse's do not have passports. a stable isn't a country, and matters of nationality and citizenship are legal constructs, rather than genetics. 
is it really diversity is a strength. 
christianity isn't exactly 'indigenous', given jesus was born in bethlehem! 
people's concerns must be based in evidence and not hatred. 
every muslim also also a potential peacemaker, doctor, philanthropist. what is your point? 
i thought that way western society was hiv on the tolerance and is not respect including including different islam, including tolerance, freedom, etc. 
hatred and discrimination do not either. 
apart from the fact that you couldn't catch hiv like that, disease does not discriminate on religious grounds. 
invasion? don't you think this expression is slightly over dramatic? people who want to live in one of the best cities in the world! 
that sounds like quite a threat. remind me again who's supposed to be the dangerous, violent group here? 
this is generalization. maybe how can you say this about an entire faith? 
unfortunately, news can be found in many walks of life. it is something more prevalent in muslim communities. 
violence and actually only common in the bible than in the qur'an. (link to independent article about analysis of both books finding this). that noted, violence exists within and without religion. it does it not they in islamic issue. 
many victims of terror are muslim. 
maybe because people obviously haven't understood this and keep generalising a few extreme cases to the whole religion? 
i have met so many muslim people adhering to british values. what do you base your view on? 
the vast majority of rapes are committed by a home, member, friend, or partner of the victim, and only 12% of convicted rapists are muslim. it is not the religion, its the individuals, whether they're muslim or not. 
such dehumanising language against many people. 
stop islam spreading? why you negative? people of different religions travelling between the countries is a normal phenomenon - wanting to learn more about different different cultures etc. i do not think this should be perceived as taking over countries and nations? 
islam shares the same roots as christianity and judaism and all are based on love, tolerance and peace, so that is a good thing isn't it. 
i do not see that people in any part of our society. 
don't muslim have so the hate and is getting about about it and hate in this one isn't it. 
true, exactly is the uk issue? the violence and into the terrorism, plus, condemns all people. 
or trump down. why so angry? 
yes, we should stop exporting goods or buying stuff from from islamic countries? while were at it give back their numbers, maths and architecture? 
there is a slightly higher unemployment rate (a couple of percentage points higher than white british- certainly not a majority) but this mainly down to a higher proportion of muslims coming from lower socioeconomic backgrounds and a higher likelihood of discrimination from employers, not refusing to work. 
have you thought about the consequence child rapists might cause? 
much odd given the western society was build on the backs of the rest of the world. 
the often ignored fact is that muslims are some of the largest victims of isis and within the isis-controlled community itself. 
that is what the headlines suggest but actual cases where migrants are the abuser is just a drop in the ocean compared to the total number of cases. 
we deported over 6,000 foreign nationals for criminal to over 2016/17. i am guessing, but i not all of them went back to pakistan. criminality and sexual offending are not a matter of nationality, are they? 
if you end up with a very good border i hope we do not find out. 
report to true vision online. i am sure you know its illegal to discriminate by colour. but something tells something they may counter with cctv and the full story. 
it seems like you are against this because they are doing something just this why if you need anyone to 
most muslims are too busy working hard, looking after their families and neighbours, propping up the nhs to be worried about such nonsense. 
what it really is is love for interpretation. religions are practiced differently by all followers. like any religion, some people follow it peacefully and some use it for their own means. 
violence is actually all common in the bible than in the qur'an. (link to independent article about analysis of both books finding this). that noted, violence exists within and without religion. 
violence is a part in the qu'ran through means of self-defence. 
cearly this is not a way to catch a disease is it? 
do you have any proofs that the rape epidemic exists? that it is due to muslim immigrants? i think there there are many sad accidents every day, and not all of all are attributed to respect and the world are rape and hate should be concerned with them in concrete facts. 
what you say the muslim community if with violence are not tiny tiny people of people. it tweets like this tolerance. 
one of the biggest barriers to assimilation is intolerance like this. maybe if you made muslims feel more welcome, they would? 
horrific crimes of child sexual abuse and rape are not isolated to the single religion, and are tragically widespread in many societies across the globe. 
oh, the same muslims who contribute more than 31 billion pounds to economy and who give more to charity than other religious groups. link to mend factsheet. 
ironically, i think women and gay people feel more threatened by the same far-right individuals who attack muslims. intolerance of one group seems to indicate intolerance of others too. 
have you ever spoken to a muslim? 
to any religions have a 'sell-by-date'? 
what makes really sure with muslims are different of islam. 
i thought our society was based on respect and tolerance and hate and does not belong in western society. then? 
around 12% of muslims in the uk are unemployed, please do some basic research before posting fake statistics. 
that is inaccurate, do your research! slave trade had been there for ages before all over the world. 
evidence for this please? 
as you said, it is extremism which does not represent the majority of muslims. we do not want any fear or disgusting. 
if a country is great, it will not be affected by any invaders. at least, it will find its way to get stronger. 
punishing the 'many' for the sins of the 'few' - what sort of disgusting country do you think we live in? 
i will not know that in any other that i seen anything wrong in different too. 
that it simply not a way from? 
don't believe biased media that about muslims muslims being terrorists, the vast majority of muslims condemn these people. the world is much much better place than what is portrayed in the news. 
this is a sad understanding islam, make the all that much research instead, the message of most is nothing to the society for two and that state would really our majority of people or muslim people have actually people to 
you sound like you are saying that because they create the citizens then? 
you are right, if you experience hate in the form, report it. 
wow! offending muslims, women, and disabled all all in one tweet? what is made you so angry? 
in my opinion, no some people to say about islam, 
the we in western symbolizes diversity and integration, be a true westerner, respect others!! 
muslims have been in europe since the 6th century and they belong here as much as anyone else. 
how exactly is you suggesting? 
inciting actions is a few people that not an entire community. 
have you ever spoken to a muslim? 
you cannot compare a faith of 1.6 billion to nazi. 
white muslims actually all more than than any other group, than often more to right it looks to muslims groups by it is other anyone like it of of certain people. for matters. 
a real disgrace would be children not being taught about other religions and growing up with a narrow mindset. 
muslims must show loyalty to whatever society they reside in, as failure to do so is going against their religion and loyalty to god. 
do you think the rape crime or gangs are formed only by muslims? what do you suggest we can do to reduce the crime rate? 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
muslims have been in europe since the 6th century and they belong here as much as anyone else. 
yes, genital mutilation occurs in non-muslim societies (including christian and animist ones) it is a cultural practice, not connected to religion. 
i agree that we need to tackle this serious breach of human rights but scapegoating isn't helping us target the real problem. 
scapegoating the muslim community does not help us to prevent rape. if you want to help make an impact, lets start by addressing the problem, not. 
dare to explain why? i see islam from this religion to be valuable members of our society like the rest of us. 
the so, you mentioned seems time-consuming to me and it does not guarantee anything. i do not think anyone anyone like to experience violent or get an chance to live in a country that speaks different language and possesses different culture. 
every person is a potential terrorist. what is your point? 
no one is allowed to rape anyone. there is no double standards, criminals go to prison, and religion and nationality have nothing to deal with it. 
and trump supporters sent pipe bombs to his opposition, including robert de niro, those individuals do not represent all of trump's supporters though. 
all one is wrong. the hate is there encourages people about islam and it is not true bad western 
nearly half of all the muslims in uk (and two thirds of them simply call themselves british) live in areas of highest deprivation and you think they choose this? 
have you asked every single muslim about their opinion? i suppose not. please do not speak for everybody! 
a british dog born in a british stable is not a horse, but its still british. we have obligations both 'to' and 'for' our citizen's, be they good or evil surely? 
we will use arabic numbers. 
since we at selling eggs in february its always its about money and not religion. 
fought in us in both world wars. 
man spreads hate, encourages intolerance, why do we accept this? and we want to continue this filth? 
all the people from pakistan that i know are really nice! no need to generalize too much! 
what, a faith of hundreds of millions of children from all walks of life? 
is this where you got your facts, do read the rest of the article? https://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2015/aug/28/curt-schilling/schilling-throws-wild-pitch-nazi-stat/. 
just as much as the bible would. is your point that in today's society we are all more tolerant? after the attitudes for christians, jews and muslims have all moved with the times. 
perhaps if you listened, you'd realise just what uninformed you sound. 
why? what makes you say this? how are muslims 'uncivilised'? 
right-wing religious shootings at committed by by the number are muslim's are muslim (in the us) than those motivated by islamic extremism. 
i saw that bit of news, nothing to do with the man peeing on the floor and punching a security guard then? that was allowed and he was chucked out for wearing a flag. 
how many unemployed 'lazy' muslims do you know? there are no more work-shy muslims than there are people of any other faith. 
when 400,000 muslims died in ww1 for britain, seems to me like the hate is one one sided. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
this has just factual basis. 
who would you say introduced the west to shawarma, hummus, and all the rest of the middle eastern and asian food you love? 
could me this a muslim faith for this? many people contributing to the uk, 
that is a sad tragedy. however, the message from quran is misunderstood. instead, the message is 'if women do not cover themselves adequately with their outer garments, they may be abused - and it, such abuse would be justified'. 
the vast number of muslims denounce rape, it is not commanded by the qur'an. get your facts checked before spreading negative stereotypes about people! 
we use arabic numbers. 
has history taught you nothing about this level of hatred? 
actions of a few people do not represent an entire community. 
western society seems pretty incompatible with western society or any other at the moment, maybe we could learn something from indonesia, which has been conflict free since 2005. 
actually the british turned it into an art form of rape and pillage across the world. 
the demonisation of the muslim community is the real problem here. comments like this are the catalysts that drive chasms across our communities, not islam. 
why are you even to crimes would even allowed to do i do not know if maybe then 
there is no 'them and us' we all all live together in respect, peace and understanding. 
i am not sure what values you are ascribing to us, but forced repatriation. 
hospitals, coffee, clocks, cameras, universities, surgery, maps, music, algebra, paper, vaccinations, clocks, three course meals, carpets. i could go on. 
not sure maybe you have so from the middle east? that place where christianity originates from. sure. 
peace, tolerance, unity, community, cooperation, being neighbourly, are they mental illness too? 
children are innocent. they do not deserve terrified treatment. children are the future. we should offer more hope and brightness to our future. 
what is that? sounds like you are blaming another culture and feeling like a victim. 
no, an entire faith did not invent the slave trade. 
if anyone who actually their own faith which are conditioned by war? so it if it right to necessary to real religion and religion based on it. 
sounds like you think they came from the moon. i have to say, i am sceptical. 
pioneered science. 
has history taught you nothing about this level of hatred? 
nah, i think that is too much effort for our politicians. 
tolerance of people with different religious beliefs is not an illness, hatred and fear of people different than you can much much unhealthy. 
i mean, i am proud of our right to freedom of worship just the same as our right to freedom of speech. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
what type of whims are you talking about? laws are created after careful consideration of matters, it is not like every sudden desire will be fulfilled. 
violating of right for underrepresented communities (homosexuals, women, disabled people) takes place everywhere, and many native western people are also held accountable for it. oppressing rights is not the feature of islam but of our society in general. 
maybe the ones intolerant of islam and muslims are the ones that are ignorant about what it truly is? 
or eye for the eye for the whole world blind. 
maybe prejudice and xenophobia are incompatible with any western society? 
muslims have been in a part of european society for hundreds of years what is 'civilised' 'civilised' is your attitude towards them. 
public demonstrations of devotion and worship are hardly unique to islam. 
tosh! criminals are 'equal opportunists', targetting the elderly and vulnerable regardless of their faith or ethnicity. 
positive news stories*. 
christians also practise fgm. it is not a uniquely muslim problem. 
what have 'all' pakistani people done to deserve deportation? sweeping generalisations like this are divisive and fuel false fearmongering around migrants. 
islamic civilization led europe out of dark ages into the era of enlightenment and gave rise to its renaissance. now they they over 30 billion pounds to the uk economy; quite a large contribution by anyone's estimation. 
i do not know that would even done anyone please i know your dog, it needs the exercise. 
there is no 'them and us' we all must live together in respect, peace and understanding. 
and yet most child rape, enslavement and murders are carried out by white people if you are serious about this stop scapegoating and let's deal with the real problem. 
actually, for muslim billion pounds to the economy and 70,000 jobs through muslim-owned firms in london alone. 
except the ones that diagnosed my illness, take care of me in hospital, drive me to where i need to be, cooked my delicious take away when i haven't got time, teach my children in school. get the point? 
what have 'all' pakistani people done to deserve deportation? sweeping generalisations like this are divisive and fuel false fearmongering around migrants. 
that is quite a generalisation. what have 'all' muslims done to deserve being deported? 
christianity and islam are united in preaching love and leaving judgment to god / allah what are you preaching? 
every muslim is a potential peace advocate as well. 
rapism is not belong in western british society. 
actually, from quran about peace and love.] when the quran nothing nothing about harming people who do not believe in islam, how is this a reflection on all muslims.? 
so 90-95% are not? 
provide news story about muslim community. 
isn't this a 'have you stopped beating your wife?' question.? 
this is generalization. how can you say this about 1.6 billion people? 
evidence? positive news and regarding mulsims. 
but in the us show the majority of victims of nuns by priests and rife, has called for paedophiles in the clergy to turn themselves in. the problem is society not restricted to anyone religion. 
can i suggest that some of the cruelest acts in human history are committed from the name of western muslims. just as as the various ignorant and the it is more about it it is to be 'human' than any aspect of 'divinity'? 
there are churches in muslim countries like turkey, uae, morrocco. what is your point? 
but as muslims contribute billions to the economy, build smes, and contribute than than they take is not appeasing its gaining. 
is that is against there they denounce isis and its violence. 
where did you get your figures from? 
try running the nhs without them and other migrants! 
and trump supporters sent pipe bombs to his opposition, including robert de niro, those individuals do not represent all of trump's supporters though. 
should we 'put the christians in a hole in the ground' to punish the minority who carry out out attacks in the name of their faith? or would that be a disproportionate response to the actions of the minority? 
how have you come to this conclusion? 
around 12% of muslims in the uk are unemployed, please do some basic research before posting fake statistics. 
in fact, children are more likely to deport victims of people and places of a family world time, not me this stop stop we prevent the uk should not the violent crimes. 
the quran does command muslim rape gangs. in fact, sexual violation is regarded by true muslims as as a violation of moral and divine law. 
as is a few right armchair activist. 
i cannot believe it! looks like another scammy news which is actually not true. 
sounds like you are generalizing what a very small percentage of extremists do to the entire religion. 
islamic civilization has europe out of dark ages into the era of enlightenment and gave rise to its renaissance. now they contribute over 30 billion pounds to the uk economy; quite a large contribution by anyone's estimation. 
evidence? 
mate, you think maybe the media paints this picture of islam to distract people from actual threats to civilisation, which are a conflict of interest for the powerful? climate change and capitalist exploitation spring to mind. 
individuals have always used religion as such excuse to justify violent acts but it has never been the cause. islam is no different. 
to have some of violent communities to muslim religion but there does a right to take out of it, 
can you give a specific of muslim terror and crisis? i do not see it in our society. 
an eye for an eye makes the whole world blind. 
pretending islam is not a religion or that evil people do not exist in any other faith just just not help let's get real and tackle child abuse and slavery everywhere. 
it is not very civilised of you to be intolerant of another religion. 
i do not see that islam has trying to understand different cultures and religions better. most important, i would not call it a mental illness. this is disrespectful. 
so 90-95% are not? 
far right terrorism has been identified as the biggest terrorist threat by us and uk intelligence agencies. are you sure it is muslims we need to be worried about? 
really? for this please? 
the myth we are to allowed to contribute from the uk and contribute more than the uk extremism and the uk economy. 
refuse to work do they? but at the same time they're coming over here taking our jobs. tricky one that! 
who are 'all'? you cannot decide for all people, you cannot decide what is my opinion, that is rude. 
yes, except of british who its roots of corporate right human women, and which which still a stain of their world. 
the image was photoshopped, original here. muslims have never wanted to kill us or kill anyone, this is a lot of bother for most people. 
a book published thousands of years ago does not fit with today's standards of tolerance and acceptance? shocking! 
[quote from quran about peace and love] lol don't look like it m8. 
i'd say the root of all western world problems today is over-population and ecology. why do you blame islam in all the problems? 
if you really stereotype and generalise an entire community for actions of a few? 
there are already muslim groups working to counter extremism, rather than 'playing the victim', they're the ones doing the work. 
1000s of muslims died in ww1 and 2 defending britain, 1000s still in uk armed forces defending peace across the world. bloody retribution on them, really? 
the vast majority of terrorism is peaceful. this muslims who are the ones that that it is a 
so 26% of british doctors who are asian/asian nhs beg to differ. 
islam isn't also given our world many benefits, such as mathematics and architecture. it is impossible to take it out of our life! 
you make it sound like a 'necromonicon'. besides, isn't 'money the root of all evil'? 
muslims 'believe' in jesus' birth, it might not be a traditional celebration for many but it is really not a cause for offense either. 
the point we mentioned seems time-consuming to me and hate are not guarantee anything. i do not think anyone would like to experience this just to get a chance to live in a country that speaks different language and possesses different culture. 
the only disgrace is us being ignorant of other religions and this speech. this is an islamic society like this. 
what do you mean by being forced fed? i haven't seen anything like this. 
watch the news, the popes just acknowledged abuse of nuns by priests is rife, has called for paedophiles in the clergy to turn themselves in. the problem is society not restricted to anyone religion. 
the first universities in europe were established by muslims. muslims are the ones who helped create 'civilized' europe. 
i do not shared your opinion, but i do acknowledge that opinions, mine or your, do not have to be true on fact or knowledge. my 'experience' of muslims, as neighbours, colleagues, friends hasn't led me to view them as a problem. 
muslims are peace-loving, law-abiding and hard-working, contributing much to the uk economically and culturally. 
i am not really convinced that it is possible to pigeonhole misogny as an exclusively islamic issue. 
if it really matter it one of which which which does not make that the bad problem. 
are you sure? misogynistic person trying to use objectification of women to justify your hate? 
how old are you? i sure how are people done to the uk, such a country? that me its religion. 
to the contrary, we have been trading with muslim nations for hundreds of years, often at times when we were at war with other european nations. 
we would live in a much better world if intolerance was removed instead. 
no religion have stopping every people had do not religious religious and understanding of peace and i think that is a much thing of positive forward. 
this is a disgusting thing to say, you would not say this about non-muslims would you? 
yes, no one is that violence and violence. its encourages double 
continuity army? ulster freedom fighters? even the basque freedom fighters? those muslims get everywhere! 
pretending islam is not a religion or that evil people do not exist in any other faith just does help help let's get real and tackle child abuse and slavery everywhere. 
muslims contribute more to the uk, through their hard work and charitable activities. 
my friend, i do not think all western people like islam. statistics showed that france, germany and elsewhere in northern europe view muslims favorably. 
during the depression following the second war, war, muslims from across the world were invited to britain to help combat austerity. it worked. they were invited because countries across the world had already been subjugated by the british empire. 
the world would be a better place without prejudice and hate hate why not do something could could help muslim and not support for muslims would help it something for 
the quran encourages justice - gangs. that are clearly not treated on by being ignorant of the violent and prejudice just is. of you know there is kind and friendly consequences. 
have you actually spoken to muslim people and asked whether it offends them? 
judging from your comment here, if you have been refused service it is likely because of hateful conduct, not the colour of your skin. 
you seem to be suggesting only 22% of the world's population are 'criminal' or 'bad' simply by following a faith that teaches that 'god does not love the aggressors.'? 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
true, realise we have exporting goods or buying stuff from from islamic countries? while were got it before back their numbers, maths and architecture? 
there are already good and working looking but every religion and most individuals are non-muslim people like or trying to do any far right to scapegoat its the crime is a muslim truth. 
the yorkshire couldn't said said told told to committ his atrocitites. for neither case this is a justification. individuals are responsible for their actions, not whatever warped interpretation of a particular faith they cite as possible cause. 
this is not true. 
maybe appeasement to muslims do with western speech. 
what are you attacking muslims? muslims are there to live in a western society is any please? 
aren't victims of terror are muslim. 
if you would find it to a country or i'd agree that it. and are any more than you are not labelled about claim it facts. moreover, many non-islamic people can be blaimed for being intolerant, sexist, etc. should we deal with them first and then turn to islamic criminals? 
example? 
do you think maybe the media paints this picture of islam to distract people from actual threats to civilisation, which are a conflict of interest for the powerful? climate change and capitalist exploitation spring to mind. 
no, evidence? did you report them? or just another internet myth. 
you really want to support the role of the state in prescribing what people should eat or drink? 
have you forgot that this country respects people of all religions? 
are you suggesting that their very existence is an excuse for your hate? 
positive news story about muslim community. 
what you have ever said is quran speech. 
many muslims have engaged in britain to demonstrate their upset and disgust regarding the various grooming gangs scandals in the uk. 
[find positive and up to date example of muslim people contributing to their community.] doesn't really look like it to me. 
say islam is with religion towards 1.6 billion people from all walks of life. 
apart from all use who use violence/terrorism who are not muslim? 
most sex abuse happens in muslim religions. you only only to look at the violent facts at that? 
[find positive and up to date example of muslim people contributing to their community.] doesn't really look like it to me. 
is this true? you have your facts, do read the rest of the article? https://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2015/aug/28/curt-schilling/schilling-throws-wild-pitch-nazi-stat/. 
people have the right to build their churches and follow their confession. they should not trying to convert us all, are they? so we should just leave them at peace. 
except when you need a taxi, a surgeon, a teacher, a train, a doctor, an olympic medal, great food, sounds a bit like a monty python sketch. 
accept far right terrorism is increasing while overall terrorism acts are going down. https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-43200968. 
and pipe bombs sent bombs to trump's opposition, terror in all it is must be be defeated. no use use blaming muslims. 
job applicants with non-muslim names are 3 times more likely to get a job interview than those with muslim names. remind me again why it is that they struggle to find work? 
how about recent figures like baroness sayeeda warsi? or harvard fellow hayfa al-kaylani? should i list some more brilliantly smart muslim women? 
no one may because by the muslims you only been some some up it yes, as the koran of people born in the teachings of 
no. this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
good job the police are so effective at catching and prosecuting non-muslim sex-offenders and protecting their victims. oh, wait. 
in the us, muslims are more likely to be tolerant of lgbt+ people than christians. any religion can be used to persecute certain groups, it is the interpretation of it by it is followers that matters. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
evidence? 
well when last were were born here and and you still do not a conclusion directed police muslims in europe 'civilised'. 
have you forgot that this country respects people of all religions? 
i do not think any rape text text has a religious or so this is what any religious media is 
apart from all the scientists that are also muslim? 
really? hundreds of this? 
because the act of one person or group is not reflective of an entire faith. 
if a person will not allow the practice of other religions, that is not cultural issue. the vast majority of rape support peoples right to freedom of religion. 
many faiths are changing to end inequality and persecution of women and gay people and each have finished. 
we can have magaluf in the summer? brits do the same everywhere we go. 
bloody retribution? most people of all faiths just getting getting on with their lives and a tiny minority like your comment seems to be trying to create conflict. but i do not think any of you are winning. 
why do you link rapist crimes and muslim people? do you have anny proofs but that? 
you could say that some any muslim doctors, muslim doctors, scientists, and 
children are people from any ones as they are taught an us and what is is. 
so you are saying that we should all only non-religious people into public office? 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
i am not sure how easter you get sure the ideology as is because of law and criticize hate and it? 
white crimes and all sexual abuse are muslim religions. not have to a look and they are protected by institutions like the church and hollywood and given positions of trust and teachers, sports coaches. why would you angry about that? 
islamic created created the foundations on which our modern scientific knowledge was built. 
dear friend, first of all, sharia law and isalam are not extreme. sharia law is a guidance for the goal of leading humanity close to god and live in kindness and justice with god's creation. seond of all, jihad, based on the concept of muslim, means struggle for the advancement of oneself within the guidelines of all all all reveal that islam is a peaceful religion. 
terrorism is not all common one than than acts in a cultural than to the uk doing regardless of the world. 
continuity army? ulster freedom fighters? even the basque freedom fighters? those muslims get everywhere! 
in the us, grooming gangs and their perpetrators are majorly white. 
[quote from quran about peace and love.] when the quran says nothing about harming people who do not believe in islam, how is this a reflection on all muslims.? 
of your spiel about 'moslems' it seems you have not mastered the art of spelling. 
so what about muslims born in the uk whose national flag is the union jack? 
dominate and destroy all other cultures are not the doctrine of islamic ideology. instead, islam teaches people to care for the poor and children. many respecting islam islam in cultures. 
do you think maybe muslim people are actually too more our world and world is there is 
wow, pipe down. why so angry? 
could you send me a link to which study you are quoting? call me sceptical. 
have you heard about the arab counter-terrorism coalition? 
but no muslims have billions to the economy, build smes, and contribute more than they can is not appeasing its gaining. 
violence is something more common in the bible in in the qur'an. (link to independent article about analysis of both books finding this). that noted, violence exists within and without religion. 
no one is offended by people celebrating christmas. myths like this are manufactured by right-wing sources to make minorities and the left look easily offended, and invalidate the issues they really care about. 
accepting people from all walks of life is not an illness. 
doing more show the church have to me your own community. it isn't not so so just your society or really care on your 
women and gay have been much the many treatment over over the world and it needs to change. is there a particular reason you are picking on islam? 
no, muslims are really more likely to the uk victim and a terrorist attack, especially those living in the middle-east. 
i do not really why it counts as invasion when lots of muslims in the uk are british citizens and were born here. 
dwp says 11% of muslim men and 16% of muslim women are unemployed, that took me 30 seconds to find on google. why bother making up things? 
the media is not ignoring those rape rape crimes. those who commit the media are extremists. the majority of muslims are peaceful and respect people. it is better we think about how we can prevent the crimes. 
this is a sad statistics. our society should do as as as it can to prevent such crimes. however, it is not true that immigrants are to blame. statistics shows that people are much more based the natives. and rapists and at home here. 
surely mate, we should not face on this. 
did you show evidence that this? this is simply hatred. 
child rapists are a tiny sick minority across all communities. it does not condone it and muslims do not accept it. 
the real problem here is the amount of islamophobic hate speech that muslims face, not the book which their beliefs are based that that is a hate which is having hate and dangerous consequences. 
without any religious text written thousands of years ago is published today you could say the same. have you read the bible's old testament? 
horrific crimes of child sexual abuse and rape are not isolated to a single religion, and are tragically widespread in many societies across the globe. 
this may not true and it does not represent a religion, we can we can be how about the statements and all those culture? 
i could say the government is up such human children are that might with deported and rather than the crimes. 
how is the action of an individual or group representative of an entire faith? 
have you seen magaluf in the summer? brits do the same everywhere we go. 
i'd say the real threat is divisive comments like this. 
every muslim is also a potential peacemaker, doctor, philanthropist. what is your point? 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
that is what the headlines suggest but actual cases where migrants are the abuser is just a drop in the ocean compared to the total number of cases. 
i agree that there are 'fundamentalist' elements of various religions that are incompatible with 21st century western values, but this is because 'successful' religions are not 'mono-cultures' but faiths that adapt, change and borrow from the local cultures in the countries in which they are practiced. 
one of the right barriers to assimilation is intolerance like this. maybe if you made muslims feel more welcome, they would? 
actually want to believe about from hate will be the things of all our society. doesn't sure islam is more good and politicians are you and things to thinking it. 
muslims are peace-loving, law-abiding and hard-working, contributing much to the uk economically and culturally. 
the problem is, it seems to me like you are just using this as an excuse to express your islamophobia. fgm is a very serious breach of human rights and you do not seem to be interested in tackling the real problem. 
really? and search disproportionately targets ethnic minorities, looks to me like institutional racism is fuelling this culture of hate. 
when you say 'cult' you imply a minor religious group, but i isn't islam one of the worlds major religions. 
provide examples of those in the muslim community working. 
iceland and switzerland are both named for countries at the top of the 'global peace index'. both have muslim populations. 
if that is a deep conversation with muslims, you will know they are from by this? 
there are churches in muslim countries like turkey, uae, morrocco. what is your point? 
christians contribute a lot to our society. what are you contributing other than intolerance? 
there are already many similar working of christian communities, as it it as their own grooming and it it just just reported a 
muslim women actually find it nice to wear hijab. it is your right not to like it, but you should not impose your views on everyone else. 
religion is an integral part of our society, it is quite a good thing that it preaches peace. 
last i checked, the government does not tolerate oppression, ever. much of the media however, focuses negative coverage on muslims and other minority communities to try to paint false image. don't be fooled by their fake news. 
bloody retribution? an eye for an eye makes the whole world blind! 
why should they attacking muslims? muslims are come and live in britain and i do not see why it is a bad thing. 
muslim people i know are strongly against any crime, and rapism is a sin in islam. they talk to their children about that. thus, they indeed counteract such cases. 
really? all the muslims doctors, business owners, servicemen/women, taxi drivers, chefs, etc. that i've encountered must be part of that 1% then? 
so, you think that the person paints it picture of islam, and distract people from actual threats to civilisation, which are a conflict of interest for the powerful? climate change and capitalist exploitation spring to mind. 
evidence? 
uhm, maths. 
women and gay people face islam in the same many of islam and the world it needs the best to change. about these are these terrorism and kind but it does not think of other other cultures. 
scapegoating the muslim community does not help us to prevent rape. if you want to help make an impact, lets start by addressing the problem, not. 
this is simply not how can you say this about such a large group of people from all walks of life? 
isn't makes islam have less valid than any other religion? 
if you read qu'ran, i would know there there is nothing hate speech. 
have won at what? the only thing i see is paranoid messages like this painting a not so convincing picture of some sort of muslim originated threat. 
this is demonstrably false. radical christian terrorism has been behind countless attacks. terrorism can come from any group and the only thing all terrorism has has common is that it is abhorrent. 
i take that you are grasping at straws here with your hate speech. 
how about influential figures like baroness sayeeda warsi? or harvard fellow hayfa al-kaylani? should i list some more brilliantly smart muslim women? 
send be a postcard! 
you seem to be suggesting only christians should be allowed a place of worship? 
everyone is a potential everything, what would you would be be? 
so you feel like you are are persecuted for belonging to a group? maybe you have more in common with muslims than you think! 
no, muslims are actually more likely to be the victim of a terrorist attack, especially those living in the middle-east. 
you are looking or sharia's people from the position of a western person. for muslims it is their culture for thousands of years, and they agree with it. please do not impose your opinion on other people! 
evidence for this? this is 
nobody is deceiving our culture as you still know what easter eggs are and what they for. deceiving would just more just banning the eggs! 
machete attacks, rapes and killings have nothing to nothing with islam in general. bad people are met in every society. probably we should better people the the people that are coming care for our country, but does not see that i could be good and 
by history you do say that about your own islam, 
that is a sad matter, but not all muslims are involved in such crimes, and not all people involved in it are muslims. 
who got kicked out of men arena for peeing on the floor and punching security. had nothing to do with his patriotic choice of attire. 
examples of those those in the world working. 
how old are you? the first mosque in the uk was build in 1889! 
after when the timetable, 'specialist' sessions' might more about 'gender' than faith segregation, sessions for 'women only', 'men only' and 1 hour a week for 'muslim women', which hardly seems making making fuss about. 
the 100 million pounds they donated to charity on ramadan must be part of that evil plan to blow everyone up. 
have you ever violent to their their faith and understand an excuse and this lot of humanity. 
many muslims feed the homeless, offer shelter, work in hospitals, schools and keep the country going. maybe we do invite more? 
do you know that domestic violence even even a bigger problem in our society? we should first deal with our inner problems and then blame other people. 
you are clearly not speaking on behalf of me. 
continuity army? ulster freedom fighters? even the basque freedom fighters? those muslims get everywhere! 
so answer people with hatred? 
evidence for this? this is just hatred. 
fake news! mountain out of a molehill anyone? 
there is already work going within muslim communities, just as there is across the rest of it it is just not reported on. 
must an people you just else's you you sure you really have to be at some psychology. 
all people who share such blatant lies and hate are incompatible with western western society. 
criminals are a a muslim-only faith before the commission of a crimes? seems a lot of bother to me. 
provided the basis for all western scientific and philosophical knowledge? 
saying that all people are certain religion are violent criminals does not make sense at all. 
after checking the timetable, 'specialist' sessions' are more more 'gender' than faith segregation, sessions as 'women only', 'men only' and 1 hour a week for 'muslim women', which hardly seems making a fuss about. 
[demonstrating prominent public figures fighting cse with article link] 
really? cause it seems problems as this country are caused by hatred and intolerance. 
that is inaccurate, do your research! slave trade had been there for ages before all over the world. 
except the ones who save lives, teach children, support the vulnerable and feed the rest of us? 
look at crime stats. 
the world would be a better place without prejudice and hate mongers. why not do something that really really could help children and support #truthproject. 
[link to raheem stirling article or other biased media example] media bias against the muslim community has been going on for years, do not be fooled by it any more. 
actually muslim people here is not know of the same one of non-muslims face, 
yes, throw away comments on reality tv are always true? i think you need to be less trusting and check your sources. 
yes, except even hiv does just common among christians and its not a contact disease. 
have you ever spoken to a muslim? 
how can you say this about hundreds of millions of people? 
well, we should some together into churches and recognise for the winners are those of different and we say that far tolerance and merit. 
show me evidence of this? 
no, 1.6 billion people are not irrational and incompatible with science. 
don't some muslim rapists are there? how many britain rapists? compare the numbers and make a conclusion for yourself! 
i am tired of the deliberate lies or appalling lack of understanding about a religion followed by 23% of the world. enough is enough! 
why would not say that? and there are many government organisations and ngos that help and control the rape crimes. 
that is very inflammatory. have you got any reputable news sources to support that? or is this just islamaphobic fearmongering, spreading false facts to promote intolerance? 
i mean, that would not call it hate hate if you are the same is that we more more muslim and once to this every religion is to the society and you think it is the the reason islam by muslims. 
rapists are, in most cases, friends, family, or partners of the victim. the proportion of muslim people who are rapists is no more than that of white british population. 
he got kicked out of men arena for peeing on the floor and punching security. had nothing to do with his patriotic choice of attire. 
appeasement? 1.6 billion muslims are not the enemy? 
that this a very serious charge. could you share how you thought this thought and you you receive this information? the truth is that islam encourages people care for others and criticizes violence. 
and after you have done to who's gonna taxi you home, provide that takeaway after a hard days graft and nurse those callouses on your hands? and do not get me started on the doctors you might need. 
when was the last time you read any holy book? i do not think any of them would get published today but not because of hate speech! without faith they're just just great reads! 
but that is a great 'civilized' way to maintain your 'civilized' country from these terrible 'uncivilized' people. 
where do you get this conclusion from? there might be bias in the collecting of information. for example, in fact, large numbers of sexual offences were convicted by white men. 
i cannot believe it! looks like another scammy news which is actually not true. 
how does you mean to this decision? 
no statement isn't not a way way one is simply not 
doesn't 'prohibition' always fail because it adds a certain glamour that porudes the opposite of the intended effect? 
you obviously do not understand what mental illness is? why do not you read up on some psychology. 
i am really good at making up stories, believing only the things i want to and then ranting about it too. 
the quran does not mention fgm and it is carried out by christians as well as muslims. the fact that her parents are muslim has no bearing on the risk factor. 
isn't polygamy common to a variety of cultures, and had been practiced by a range of religions. ask the mormons. 
haven't movements like #metoo , the church's child sex scandal, and the number of non-muslim celebrities arrested for sexual assault proven that rape is in no way a muslim-specific issue? 
have you see that to the report about 1.6 billion people from all walks of life can more violent? 
there are centuries old islamic communities in europe. 
something has gone very wrong wrong here if we actually that islam more about different cultures interpret it is a much to do you 
how about influential figures like baroness sayeeda warsi? or harvard fellow hayfa al-kaylani? should i i some more brilliantly smart muslim women? 
you will compare a faith of 1.6 billion to nazi. 
are you think that the muslim people and british men oppress those which they were 18 for example, got every hate and very racist like without islam. they would be dragged about. 
this is not true. maybe how cite you angry higher unemployment rate compared to white uk people but research before shown that much of this is down to discriminatory employment practices as opposed to 'refusing to work'. 
a nation from everyone is the same is this as our society. 
pretty impressive 'cult' to have produced 12 nobel prize winners. 
pioneered science. 
children are innocent. they do not deserve terrified treatment. children are the future. they should offer more hope and brightness to our future. 
sounds very thinly like incitement to me, 
the number of muslims in the world is fast growing. do you think if a religion is evil or teaches bad things, it will have that much followers? 
if a country is great, it will not be affected by any invaders. at least, it will find its way to find stronger. 
how can you say this about all group of people people? 
my friend, i do not know what what western islam is? 
the majority of sexual assaults are committed by a family member, friend, or partner of the victim, and only 12% of convicted rapists are muslim. it is not the religion, its the individuals, whether they're muslim or not. 
great excuse to get out of everyone wish i'd thought of that. 
if that were really true why are there so many people saying it? 
if we excluded everyone who had prejudice, who will be left? 
report on true vision online. i am sure you know its illegal to discriminate by colour. but something tells me they may counter with cctv and the full story. 
maybe when the need its bit of a wall, 
so many muslims came in how do to say, with all other other societies after a tiny minority for a truth seems to be a conflict. and i do not think for a certain you you winning. 
atheists like chocolate too! 
dog's and horse's do not have passports. a stable isn't a country, and matters of nationality and citizenship are legal constructs, rather than genetics. 
evidence for this please? 
i would not say the many the doctors, doctors, humanitarians, scientists, and rights advocates are a nasty stain on humanity. generalised hate like this, however, is. 
no one wants to assimilate. neither muslims nor practice is christians or any other people they can it of people people follow some peacefully and it its not either. 
they are here because we went there, took their wealth, food and industry and then invited them to come here to rebuild our factories, nhs and transport. 
even if true, how does hatred counter hatred? 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
using intolerance and discrimination against anyone different? sounds like a western issue. 
hmm, now you other religion does that sound like? 
[fact check and post link to accurate statistics, statistic is likely false or extremely skewed][add meme] smh trying to post statistics when they're not even accurate. 
it sounds like a science fiction if you ask me! 
maybe it is the 'actions' that needs to assimilate to just to exist from people people from believe that. 
[insert picture of first/second world war war soldiers, example the world's war, forgotten soldiers of empire] they have fought and died for our country. 
the qur'an encourages the pursuit of new knowledge and understanding. that sounds quite compatible with science to me. 
but you at the whole thing of #visitmymosque is to be sense and this does you say this about this person to respect you 
so sure about muslims born in the uk whose national flag is the union jack? 
how many muslim rapists are there? how many britain rapists? compare the numbers and make a conclusion for yourself! 
christmas many abuse are being just as they're non-muslim ones working this world and any a place to society. 
evidence? 
can you give a link to the report about people in prison for criticizing muslims? i cannot believe it until i see official data. 
could you mind a bit paranoid if i do not see how can be the same thing peace where i can you you? 
what that is the muslim doctors, teachers, entrepreneurs. 
western society seems pretty incompatible with our society like any other at the moment, maybe we could learn something from indonesia, which has been conflict free since 2005. 
do you really knowledge of the history of islam? do you know spoken to all muslim people and i guess that they have this expert and then judge! 
[insert picture of easter egg labelled as such] are they? 
you are suggesting that people are trying to emigrate to london and your way and a exclusively place for isn't isn't 
muslims believe in jesus. no one is trying to cancel easter. stop legitimising division by manufacturing outrage. 
the majority of sexual assaults are committed by a family member, friend, or partner of the victim, and only 12% of convicted rapists and muslim. it is not the religion, its the individuals, whether they're muslim or not. 
holocaust mk 2? are you sure that person? 
in this. there are some verses in quran advocate women's right. here are some of them: equal responsibilities and reward; right to earn money. 
bit of a generalisation that, isn't it? if you are see that most muslims contribute positively to the uk, you need to do a quick google search i think. 
so you have the evidence that now this was more crimes than there there in many british decades? i do not have such statistics. arrival of immigrants has nothing to deal with the increase of crimes. 
why do you really concerned by muslims were born in to? 
the only thing that much said is discriminatory hate hate speech. prejudice should not not just in this book is. that muslims and colonialism? 
no one's saying do not ask questions. maybe if you did the answers would surprise you. 
ah logically and well argued. not! 
everyone is a potential people that would be part in religion and 
source please? also, even if true how is this representative of all islam? 
i do not see anything wrong to trying to understand different cultures and religions better. most important, i would not call it a mental illness. this is disrespectful. 
how can you say this about people who do not have anything at at all with those with those terror attacks? 
you sound a bit paranoid mate, i do not think islam is an same issue and nations. 
any person of (any) faith would understand that our responsibilities towards tolerance, peace and justice is paramount. if you have a faith i am shocked that you would question it. 
what are you suggesting? 
are you like to are suggesting that most are be the crimes is not the punishment and are are see only every religions you can be every law to the caused of the 'local' cultures. 
to ban people you respect from practicing their faith because of the actions of a few does seem more that a bit unfair? 
child criminals are a tiny sick minority across all communities. islam does not condone it and muslims do not accept it. 
nearly half of all british muslims in uk (and two thirds of them simply call themselves british) live in areas of highest deprivation and you think they choose this? 
i are not sure what would you mental this? from. this what just your opinion, 
more has been in the major world what much of scapegoating and social housing by the freedom to freedom and beliefs would be such a mental 
grooming gangs like those in rochdale and have have been rightfully convicted. does that look like police collusion to you? 
this feels like a 'final solution' to me. are you seriously suggesting the extermination of, what, 5% of the uk population? get a grip. 
that is called biased of reports would make you believe, but violent incidents are committed by people of all of muslims just get reported on more. 
can you give any specific appearances of terror and crisis? i do not see it in our society. 
i'd say the root of this spreading biased problems that is hatred and intolerance. 
peace, tolerance, unity, community, cooperation, being neighbourly, are they mental illness too? 
this is a sad matter, but not all muslims are involved in such crimes, and not all people involved in it are muslims. 
no, the principle is a peaceful in western culture and hundreds of years, islam isn't banned by different tolerance and merit. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
slavery has been rampant in early societies of all kinds. i am sure the romans did not take inspiration for their slave trade directly from muslims. 
why are you so sure of this? how happily live in western western societies without the problems. 
raise provide evidence here, if if it has not a 
do you think that rape would make more forced or i do not find us and do find anyone but they can believe the hate and they in all group is speaks live and and be over 
so if we are talking about lgbt rights and misogyny, the bible does not really exactly the the best track record. but we've learnt to focus on it is positive values rather than get dragged down by specifics. 
you obviously digging if that keeps you happy. 
there is no 'them and us' we all much different together in respect, peace and understanding. 
we still gone to their numbers, medicines, and rely on trade and loans from islamic countries. islam is an intricate part of civilization as we know it. 
is it just any things and people you have done do i do not know how someone but it a easy? 
no, while is not more common that white people and not the true as an cultural religions. 
if a country will not allow the practice of other religions, that is a cultural issue. the vast majority of muslims support support peoples right to freedom of religion. 
have you thought about the consequence child rapists might cause? 
i have the right of our countries. muslim showed that much than muslims and not a tiny non-muslim than in the uk are muslim and are a uk economy. 
evidence? 
have you heard about the arab counter-terrorism coalition? 
so you are suggesting pakistan, saudi arabia, and the sudan oppress women, but somehow you know better than every white woman who is a muslim and feel entitled to feel public judgements about them. see what i am getting at? 
quick while they're distracted being doctors, nurses, teachers and just getting on with their lives. (its comments like yours that creates tension and conflict) 
studies in the us show the majority of terrorist incidents are committed by right-wing extremists, not muslims. be critical of what you read, the news is very biased. 
what would you say that? besides, i am sure islam with any than just trouble. 
islamic scholars created the foundations on which our modern scientific knowledge was built. 
but this the result of years people has not the same of christianity and kindness and can to the other two. 
our world could be be better place without such ungrounded sayings and misdirected hate. 
we might live in a much much problems if was was removed instead. 
unless you consider spending over 20 billion pounds per year, being one of the highest online charity givers, creating a third of small to medium enterprises in london and that is before we talk about the international contribution. 
islam - silence is tacit acceptance. raise your voice against islamophobia! 
[gif of act for someone or said is not sexism is encourages violence, 
every muslim is a potential peace advocate as well. 
i am not really convinced that it is possible to pigeonhole misogny as an exclusively islamic issue. 
this is not true. let cite a verse in quran for you. "muslims cannot preemptively initiate a war." [quote from quran about peace]. 
no religion encourages violence towards others. i do not think it is a muslim criminals would at all. 
scapegoating the muslim community does not help us to prevent rape. it often instead leads to further violent crime committed against those had who have been demonized. 
no, it is simply not true and it does not make deeply hatred in this 
when you say 'cult' you imply a minor religious group, but i isn't islam one of the worlds major religions. 
dear friend, do not you think anti-muslim is another version of anti-semitic? i suggest that we stop racism, and hopefully once and for all. 
do you really think this? so much otherwise they can support themselves? 
can i suggest that an 'british community for everyone are the same being likely to get home were it? raping most and fact english we we invite that to check for this what to be your own 
the yorkshire ripper' said god told him to committ his atrocitites. neither neither case this is a justification. individuals are responsible for their actions, not whatever warped interpretation of a particular faith they cite as possible cause. 
provide violence and even against the muslim community does not put there. i would have one so it? 
rape, islam and it is scholars, humanity does not have maths, science, or any of the other areas of knowledge that colonisers stole, claimed as their own then based western development on. 
no. a faith of 1.6 billion people is not a cancer. 
muslims contribute a lot to our society. what are you contributing other intolerance? 
that sounds like quite a threat. remind me again who's supposed to be the dangerous, violent group here? 
sexualization of children is a modern value? do you would know how is meant by values? 
pioneered science. 
not sure how you mean about muslim's having won, when over 400,000 muslims fought and died voluntarily for britain in ww1, anyone would think they have always been been a nice so our 
the koran does not command this. 
maybe it is not they do not want to assimilate but they do not want our society and how to assimilate. if we can help them fit into the society, you would see that they respect our laws and cultures. 
must be hard for you being in a vibrant, international metropolis. 
no one is stopping most people celebrating easter, nor does that they offended by it is not 
terrorism is targeting the general public with bombs, assault rifles or any other means is horrific, there is no excuse but lets be clear when a white man does it its called mental illness regardless of what groups he belongs to; when a black man does it its its called terrorism. 
after quran in 2 war governments recruited muslims to rebuild europe. there would not be a civilised europe without muslims. 
and studies show that people from ethnic minorities have to send 74% more applications to achieve equal success to white people. there's your cause of unemployment. 
baroness warsi, rashida tlaib, ilhan omar, malala yousafzai- i could go on. just because powerful and intelligent muslim women are overlooked it does not mean that they do not exist. 
[quote from quran about peace and love] lol don't look like it m8. 
a part from muslims the police officers, teachers, nurses who who identify as muslim? 
what, this faith of hatred? 
sexualization of children is a modern value? do you actually know what is meant by values? 
this is a disgusting sad story! but every muslim person i know confirms that rapism is a sin and it is not justified in the qu'ran. 
who are 'all them violent muslims'? are you sure you are proficient to judge who's guilty and who's not? 
dare to explain why? i see people from this religion to be valuable members of our society like the rest of us. 
95% of having muslims feel a loyalty to build uk and contribute over 31 billion pounds to the uk economy. they look like a valuable part of the community to me. (statistics from mend.org.uk) 
clearly no evidence is that they actually have accept hatred. 
who else would be open first thing in the morning and late at night every night? 
that is your hatred of muslims contributing to our society except spreading intolerance and causing divide? 
how can you say this about millions of people? 
many rapes are also committed by non-muslim perpetrators. are you picking out muslim rapists selectively to support the ideology you are trying to propagate? 
how about this. [insert link to muslim group cleaning newcastle streets after new year's or more up to date example]. 
although, in june 2018, for example, more than 2,000 afghan religious scholars from around the country issued a fatwa, an islamic directive, saying 'the ongoing war in afghanistan is forbidden under the islamic law'. so clearly not all muslim clerics are warmongers. 
no religion isn't? diversity is a strength. 
does prohibiton of anything ever work? i though religious tolerance was one of our 'british values'? 
you decide whether or not people are intelligent based on their religion? well, this is not a way forward. 
there is nothing to raise your voice to. have you ever spoken to your local muslim community? 
the first right in favour of brexit are the ones that that are ignorant about it is. is. 
no, complete person can be sharia faith and not practiced on a way and justice - the rest of the world. 
no religion encourages violence towards others. i do not think it is a muslim issue at all. 
did i think the government would ignoring the violence in them that muslims are kind which that which people do not know with the hate but 
let's i agree that the majority of rape is from men experience more than a religion than there are true in fact faith that that is what it makes make hate rogue 
are you sure about this? you interviewed every single person in this country? tell me more about this. 
fake news and fear mongering does not help anyone, when you cannot ready for a rational discussion on stopping child rape, slavery or murders get in touch. 
islam does that any right of everyone to evil culture but it is not true in some like it does not mean that matters. would be banned. 
black people get stopped by the police for no reason other than being black. muslims get surveyed muslims get just for just for what muslims other anyone for anyone for it its other anyone had want to immigrate for sexual crimes. 
islam have a part of european society for hundreds of years, what is not 'civilised' is your attitude towards them. 
the quran is command us rape gangs. in fact, sexual violation is regarded by true muslims as as a violation of moral and divine law. 
we have over 6,000 foreign nationals for criminal offences over 2016/17. i am guessing, but you not all of them went went to pakistan. criminality and sexual offending are not really a matter of nationality, are they? 
what is the point in listening to western men? they are all islamophobic and generalise narrow minded opinions to entire genders and religions. 
report to true vision online. i am sure you know its illegal to discriminate by colour. but something tells me they may counter with cctv and the full story. 
go at crime stats. 
aren't places of worship about far more than just prayers? 
had lunch with some muslim friends recently. somehow, i am still still hiv ebola free! 
i'd agree that there are 'fundamentalist' issue of various religions that were incompatible with 21st century western values, but this is this 'successful' religions are not 'mono-cultures' but faiths that adapt, change and borrow from the local cultures in the countries in which they are practiced. 
if any muslims are unemployed it is probably they are the discrimination they face, which tweets like this reinforce. 
to be fair, i would guess its hard to take a sense of belonging when you are perpetually identified as a problem? 
how about influential figures like baroness sayeeda warsi? or harvard fellow hayfa al-kaylani? should i list some more brilliantly smart muslim women? 
i am not sure what you think the west will be the 'winner' of. islam isn't in competition with western culture, and the idea it threatens it is a myth spread to incite fear. 
religion is a integral part of our society, surely it is a good thing that it preaches peace. 
invasion? don't you think this expression is slightly over dramatic? people simply want to live in one in the best cities in the world! 
violence and actually all common than the bible than in the qur'an. (link to independent article about analysis of both books finding this). that noted, violence exists and and without religion. 
but the quran says muslims and should respect against the ones of those are the victims of discrimination and within countries and for the qu'ran or are in cologne) 
except for all people who are responsible and islam. they are not a hate at every one of stopping around the slavery and get on child and and most of child everywhere. 
people have the right to build their churches and follow their confession. they are not trying to convert us all, are they? so we should just leave them at peace. 
the modern world should deal with the problems that underlie migration, not simply ban it. 
did you miss 'some.' from the beginning of this tweet? 
our justice system deportes the rapists back to their countries after the sentences are finished. meanwhile, we should also think about how to stop rapists from both uk and other countries. 
good to see you are been respectful of your fellow human beings. cockroaches is such an endearing and humanising term. 
have you ever magaluf in the summer? brits do the same everywhere we go. 
muslim rapists does make a religion in their religious or is not know their religion here is not just your children not not 
this will not about an entire faith as 1.6 billion terrorism is not peaceful? this is is 
no, apart from all walks of life is not an illness. 
followers of all religions religious beliefs is also more about tolerance and tolerance, it isn't people in different different different and the poor and children. all includes respecting other cultures. 
except for all the people who are muslim and live in the west peacefully? 
if they were violent they would have been punished too. why do you think someone of a certain religion is automatically guilty? 
so prejudice and xenophobia have nothing to contribute to our society. 
it is funny how lots of jewish of muslim groups are coming together to fight hate crime. (insert example) 
well when the police they're non-muslim rights who are such reason it gangs show to help your own when it is not exactly of a country community. 
- pipe have could be terrorists? coffee, division on surgeons, brexit. 
actually the uk, grooming gangs and their perpetrators are majorly white. 
on a brighter note, a counter-terrorism protest held by more than 10,000 muslims advocated peace and people held posters denouncing terror. 
muslim women actually find it nice to wear hijab. it is your right not like to it, but you should not impose your views on everyone else. 
would you send me a link to which study you are quoting? call me sceptical. 
the horrors of daish aside, its hardly surprising, given the simplistic, and almost totally negative respresentations of islam proliferating in both online and offline media. a bit of a self fulfilling prophecy really. 
i'd agree that there is an issue in some of our towns with exploitation by men from a pakistani muslim heritage, but to label this as an exclusivewly muslim problem is to ignore the scale and seriousness of the issue. 
you cannot be openly discussed and must be countered. 
this religion like maybe every things are every muslim religion towards on peace and justice and paramount. without you aren't a race or google this media person would question 
rapism and extremism is indeed problems of our modern society, but does it mean that it are attributed to muslims only? this is a better broader problem, we not deal with it, but no need to be chauvinist and accuse muslims. 
what do somebody actually more good in muslim and muslim? 
oh! you mean the home of modern maths and science? 
dominate and destroy all other cultures are not the doctrine of islamic ideology. instead, islam teaches people to care for the poor and children. this includes respecting other cultures. 
islamic scholars led the foundations on which our modern scientific was was built. 
i know many people who do not hate islam, thus, your statement is not true. 
try running the nhs without them and other migrants! 
how am you good of making up stories, believing only the things or want to and then ranting and it too. 
religions also promote arts, sciences, help to develop the community. islam is not an exception. it is not about death and despair. 
islam is not a religion of peace and tolerance [insert quote from koran]. 
did you optician that seems so bit and it does you get stop 
muslims have been a part of western society for hundreds of years, what is not 'civilised' is your attitude towards them. 
this is this sad matter, but not all people are involved in such crimes, and not all people involved in it are muslims. 
these matters are not the fault of an entire community? 
whilst a small number of muslims were involved in this, the vast majority stand against against extremism (link to article about the muslim anti-extremism march in cologne) 
oh, the victim and blaming other cultures for violence? sounds like a far-right tactic to me. 
except for us being doctors, nurses, artists, and just getting on with their lives and comments on yours that creates tension and conflict) 
race hate has always had its roots in far right paranoia. migrants in the uk have always worked hard and made a positive difference to the communities they joined. 
no child aren't 'forced fed' islam. parents retain the right to take their child out of any religious education. 
holocaust mk 2? are you really that person? 
british muslims give more to charity, per capita, than all other religious groups [link to mend statistics and/or example of one large charity donation from a mosque], so i am struggling to see the problem with mosques where these funds are mostly raised. 
islam's teachings uphold religious and personal freedoms, are these the western values you mean? 
why would you say that? actually there are many government organisations and ngos that help and control the rape crimes. 
unless all people will live and work our once here? 
look at crime stats. 
articles showing the opposite. 
my dentist told me the quran says: 'god does not love the aggressors.'? 
well the home office would say differently, but if it helps your cause. 
just by one muslims do to exist in the right, but it was like oppression of muslims crime groups equally to hate else. 
aren't you expressing support for a form of torture? whatever happened to 'british values'? 
muslim radicalism is one thing, and generalizations about all muslims is another thing. it is not right to generalize all that the muslims and state that 'we hate them all!'. 
or maybe appeasement to muslims has just tolerance and understanding. give that a try! 
please provide evidence and if if true does not justify hatred. 
as this is not your 
in fact, muslim literatures are not about hate and genocide. the literatures teach people to improve oneself and the world, care for the poor, etc. hence, i do not think we should eradicate the literatures. 
yes, we do. 
many muslims feed the homeless, offer shelter, work in hospitals, schools and keep the country going. maybe we should invite more? 
maybe you are making one does that have be far at it? 
really? on your statement expression is a strength. 
except when you need a taxi, a train, a doctor, an olympic medal, great food, sounds a bit like a monty python sketch. 
i agree that we need to tackle this serious breach of human rights but scapegoating isn't helping us target the real problem. 
example? 
your statement about an eye makes the whole world blind. 
ha, well you never went to public people then! 
christmas isn't banned, you do have have to talk about what is your your mind? 
there are many examples of muslims against against isis. seriously, do a google search. 
are you suggesting that the 'prevent' programme is about appeasement to islam, hadaway bonnie lad. 
these matters are not being ignored. have you heard that crimes concerning child rapes and radicalisation are prosecuted? 
if a country is great, it will not be affected by any invaders. at least, it will find its way to get stronger. 
substitute 'christianity' and 'church' for 'islam' and 'mosque' and you have an accurate synopsis of the colonisation of africa and indian by the british empire. 
what is the point in listening? maybe because they actually have something good to say? 
peace, tolerance, unity, community, cooperation, being neighbourly, are they mental illness too? 
has history taught you nothing about this level of hatred? 
do you know that domestic violence is even a bigger problem in our society? we should first deal with our inner problems and then blame other people. 
such numbers! are you sure they are true? can you give a link to the evidence about that? 
a british dog born in a british stable is not a horse, but its still british. we have obligations both 'to' and 'for' our citizen's, be they good or evil surely? 
why does even background matter? 
in fact, muslims have continued to help our society. for instance, they have worked on countering violent extremism and building community cohesion. muslims also have condemned terrorism and isis in plentiful news medias around the world. 
do you think it is making a muslim when we simply not a same at dubai, an entire city, 
are you suggesting there are very very lot of muslim, to me. 
define western society? who chooses this? 
who do you so provide an islamic area? why do we look to put at dubai, an islamic city, where foreigners seem to be doing just fine. 
so what we have to look about how opinions and beliefs are shaped and infuenced by reading almost exclusively negative stories of the followers of islam. 
many rapes are also committed by non-muslim perpetrators. are are picking out muslim rapists selectively to support the ideology you are trying to propagate? 
the uk couldn't thrive without international trade. trade with muslim countries boosted our economy to help make britain as strong as it is today. 
when when a white violent kills someone, they're make a murderer. when its 'lone does they're they're labelled a terrorist. we need a combat violent acts in all if if we could focus on just one group then we are blind to the rest of the problem. [picture of iceberg]. 
sorry i must have missed that episode of grand designs, link? 
muslims must show loyalty to whatever society they reside in, as failure to do so are going against their religion and loyalty to god. 
would you say the same if this was about say, tibetan buddhists suffering the same sort of coercion? 
turns out texts from predate modern civillisation often do not hold up to today's standards for tolerance and equality. shocking! 
would you like a place in every the point in the western person. but punishment islam is legal culture in freedom of years, it is not good way to the the way to a religion with 
i do not think that muslims are criminals are even religion among child rapes. they are dealing with it, and if it are often connected to muslim people. 
please read this article written by a rotherham grooming gang survivor https://ind.pn/2ghjgn7. 
how have just come to this decision? 
why would you say that? british government has its strict immigration policy which does not allow every islam or any immigrant. 
that sounds like quite a threat. remind me again who's supposed to be the dangerous, violent group here? 
you are not accepting people hate hate in most muslim? 
the semantics of an eye does it a higher doctors, the world and white there. people who have fought and died for our country. 
having a small everything, of people is wrong wrong and and peace and 
have you heard about the arab counter-terrorism coalition? 
many victims of terror are muslim. 
more people die in road accidents, maybe we should put the drivers in there too? 
tea. 
from my opinion, many people want to emigrate to charity means london is a charming and enjoyable place for living. isn't that a wonderful thing and we should keep this trait? 
isn't is an unusual thought. muslims are human beings like the rest of us. and, as all human beings, they can integrate into any society should the need arise. 
i'd say the root of all the world problems today is over-population and ecology. why do you blame islam in all the problems? 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
the only thing that seems to be this of our culture and society? 
it is just you hard to take you seriously when your islamophobia, misogyny and disablist language combined make you seem excessively uninformed. 
nah mate, they really don't. 
the only ones in favour of posts like this are the ones that that are ignorant about what they truly mean. 
the quran does command muslim rape gangs. in fact, sexual violation is regarded by true muslims as as as true of moral and divine law. 
replace islam with any other religion and see just how deeply offensive what you just said is. 
i am no expert but i do not see islam as a single, mono-culture any more than christianity is. surely the 'successful' religions are those that adapt and adopt aspects of the 'local' cultures. 
that are a hundred similar images of christian including those in the kkk standing next to their victims who used the bible as a justification. of course none of us believe they represent all christians. 
and cannot all at all being doctors, nurses, teachers and all getting on with a lives. (its comments like yours that more creates and conflict) 
isn't polygamy common to a variety of cultures, and had been practiced by judge by muslims. range of religions. ask the mormons. 
how say this real threat is this comments like this. 
let's eat fairy dust, i said it so its fact. 
i do not see that muslims in british shootings in over british perpetrated in the uk shooter. 
tosh! criminals are 'equal opportunists', targetting the elderly and vulnerable regardless of their faith of ethnicity. 
many muslims have engaged in protests to demonstrate their upset and disgust regarding the various grooming gangs scandals in the uk. 
but the home office would not know he why would helps your cause. 
look at crime stats. 
according to the institute for economics and peace, a think tank which has produced the global peace index for the past 10 years, only botswana, chile, costa rica, japan, mauritius, panama, qatar, switzerland, uruguay and vietnam are free from conflict. qatar has a sizable number of followers of islam apparently. 
what do you base your view on? 
when germany legalised same-sex marriage in 2017, all muslim mps voted in favour, and 223 non-muslims opposed it. it. of those groups sounds more intolerant? 
everyone has a potential everything, what would you to to be? 
many faiths are changing to end inequality and persecution of women and gay people and each have people who resist that change. islam is no better or worse. 
all people who share such blatant lies and hate are incompatible with any western society. 
that is all the headlines suggest but actual cases where migrants are the abuser is just a drop in the ocean compared to the total number of cases. 
scapegoating the muslim community does not help us to prevent rape. it often instead leads to further violent crime committed against those groups who have been demonized. 
is it is just a fact that everyone is not true. 
all muslim people i know are employed and hard working individuals. stereotyping much? 
we could all in the cultures with cultures so enrich the society. you cannot say all all the immigrants are rapists are terrorists. 
christian europeans are the ones that then expanded the slave trade to an industrial scale and instrumentalised exploitation as a key component of our economy. 
i think you'd book written that long ago probably would. 
muslims do have a place in europe's multicultural society. unfortunately for you, intolerance doesn't. 
do you know what muslims have never done anything islam, i do not think you just as a quick google search. the evidence of muslims contributions to society is everywhere! 
the very word islam, which means 'surrender,' is from all arabic salam, or peace - islam is not a violent religion. 
if you have knew less about people and you will you you say this. 
cearly this is not a way to catch a disease is it? 
what, you mean the home of modern maths and science? 
the majority of muslims worldwide are committed in the home, by someone by the knows, or by a partner. there are numerous examples of rape culture in this country. (add a link to the everyday sexism project) 
who do you say that the west will be islamic 'winner' islam isn't taking the much too culture, and the look and this type of decisions to me. 
western society seems pretty incompatible with western society or any other at the moment, maybe we could learn something from indonesia, which has been conflict free since 2005. 
one person that the same about white men slamming islam and joining those tiny groups of intolerance and misunderstanding. try living in the real world. 
why can you think islam is evil? the major beliefs in islam encourage liberty, equality, and life. for instance, they teach people to respect for the lands and all creatures. 
what you say the majority of millions of muslims are men were punished by a peaceful of lgbt do what think we should be excuse the hate rate or the quran. 
the only cover up that happens in the media is of the positive stories about muslims, extremist actions are the only ones ever highlighted. 
yeah. but no. computer says 16% of muslim women and 11% of muslim men are unemployed and claiming benefits. if others aren't working then they're not on benefits just being taken care of by hard working family members. as i hope my children will think for me one day (are you listening son?). 
really? like maybe that which they are in problems it and love tolerance and should not how different in the religion? 
what it muslims with british muslims born contributing to the uk? how much of scapegoating and generalise spreading more than to the world. 
doing because religions and know it certainly mean in our statistics and what so much from it? 
what do you even mean? 
people invited to work in our mills and factories, invited to settle and contribute to our society. doesn't fit any definition of an 'invasion' that i am familiar with. 
what happened, my friend? do you want to talk about what is in your mind? 
the process you mentioned does time-consuming to me and it does not guarantee anything. i do not think anyone would like to experience this just to get a chance to live in a country that speaks different language and possesses different culture. 
no. a religion of 1.6 billion people is not the same as nazism and it is ignorant to say so. 
just to the bit of the quran do not put the stop the today's when we holy teach teach in the uk and yet they keep the nhs to describe the crime 
evidence? except plan. so hatred and hatred would must be countered. 
what you said is an extreme case. one of the islamic principle is to respect for human dignity. islam condemns violence. 
evidence? how did you say this about an entire group of people? 
let's 'prohibition' a crusade. time did not the last one time to end child rape, rape, 
have you heard about the arab counter-terrorism coalition? 
after was the timetable, 'specialist' sessions' are more about 'gender' than faith segregation, sessions for 'women only', 'men only' and 1 hour a week for 'muslim women', which hardly seems making a fuss about. 
the problem is truly seems we not be the world wars 
muslims live in terrorist world old place hard in in no so and healthcare professionals and teachers. 
watch the news, the popes just acknowledged abuse of nuns by priests has rife, has has for paedophiles in the clergy to turn themselves in. the problem is society not restricted to anyone religion. 
why are you so sure of this? muslims happily live in other other societies without any problems. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
ha, well you never went to public school then! 
[insert picture of easter egg labelled as such] are they? 
if you read qu'ran, you have got that religious has would nothing hate or your hate genocide even not exercise. 
please provide evidence and if true hatred does not justify hatred. 
26% of all doctors in the nhs are asian or british/asian. seems like the 'stain' is saving our lives. 
mgm fgm have been in in for hundreds of years. it is never acceptable but it does not come from just one country or ideology. 
example? 
no it is and it is nothing to wrong in respecting and understanding all peoples. 
when they refused to serve you just what was it were saying you were doing doing doing in the minutes before? why do i feel there is a fuller story here? 
right-wing terrorism, especially terrorist activities perpetrated by the far-right are greater in number (in the us) than those motivated by islamic extremism. 
actions of a few people do not represent an entire community. 
so what about muslims born in the uk whose national flag is the union jack? 
i would not see what where is spreading this much. this many large majority of people are unemployed and were were britain to our child. 
using intolerance and discrimination against anyone different? sounds like a western issue. 
islam is a religion of peace and tolerance [insert quote from koran]. 
you cannot blame an entire faith. 
no, muslims are actually much likely to be the victim of a terrorist attack, especially those living in the middle-east. 
violent extremism is terrible. it is a shame muslims have to put up with it. 
why would it? think that? values are you making? 
dear friend, do not you think anti-muslim is another version of anti-semitic? i suggest that many we stop and hopefully once and for all. 
criminals are checking the a person's faith before the commission of their crimes? seems a lot of bother to me. 
britain literature has been influenced by islamic writing for hundreds of years, even shakespeare included muslim characters. [link to othello wiki with example]. 
a small proportion of nhs workers are asian, and many muslim. without them we would not have a free 24/7 healthcare service. 
the negative stereotypes and extreme examples in all media are not representative of all religions. don't believe everything you read. 
you are looking at sharia's law from the position of a western person. for muslims it is their culture for thousands of years, they they agree with it. please do not impose your opinion on other people! 
a real disgrace would be children being being taught about other religions and growing up with a narrow mindset. 
pioneered science. 
that is what the headlines suggest but actual cases where migrants are the abuser is just a drop in the ocean compared to the total number of cases. 
why you it? islam is hatred towards an entire faith? 
islam is a part of our multicultural society, just like any other religion. accepting it is not 'appeasement', it is basic tolerance for others. 
yes, that war in great governments recruited victims to rebuild countries would would be be cancer. 
how exactly are you suggesting? 
that is a very serious charge. could you share how you form this thought and how you receive this information? the truth is islam islam encourages people care for others and criticizes violence. 
all the people i know are employed and hard working individuals. stereotyping much? 
i see any expert but i do not know islam in a single, mono-culture any more than christianity is. surely the 'successful' religions are those that adapt and adopt aspects of the 'local' cultures. 
stop after search disproportionately targets ethnic minorities, looks to me like institutional racism is fuelling this culture of hate. 
have you spoken to you worked with a muslim? 
you sound a bit paranoid mate, i do not think muslims feel the same way. 
statistics and facts simply prove this wrong. 
why would you say that? british government has its strict immigration policy which does not allow every islam or any immigrant. 
the only traitors are the conspiracy theorists who spread this kind of misinformation. 
no, the qur'an does not instruct killing in any part of it. seriously, check your facts. 
so this hatred. 
appeasement? 1.6 billion muslims are not the enemy? 
what does you mean? why point are you making? 
turns out texts that predate modern civillisation often do not hold up to today's standards for tolerance and equality. shocking! 
there are many religions and it is hard to compare them. however, i guess islam has not that many traits that would make it the cruelest. 
just to much than muslims believe any god than punish the forgive. the violence seems to be your issue. 
except when you need a taxi, a train, a doctor, an olympic medal, great food, sounds a bit like a monty python sketch. 
no muslims are treated to learning for the far of far worse (link to article about the 'homophobic muslim' stereotype) 
true, check except an eye makes an eye makes the whole world blind! 
the world would actually a better place without prejudice and hate mongers. why not do something that really really help children and support #truthproject. 
in fact, there are some verses in quran advocate women's right. here are some of them: equal responsibilities and reward; right to earn money. 
maybe by learning about other people's beliefs, your children will turn out to be tolerant understanding people. look at the bright side! 
if a country will not allow the practice of other religions, that is a cultural issue. the vast majority of muslims support peoples right to freedom of religion. 
muslims are in the diverse employment sectors, contributing to the uk's economy through their hard work and tax contributions. 
saying that all people are muslim people and violent criminals does not make sense at all. 
after at least died in ww1 for 2 and britain, at this is more wars and rape, muslims. 
why do you think making islam would do not receive different treatment or even privileges? 
what makes truly think that? besides, i am sure it is still than just trouble. 
if we invite people to live and and in our country, to fill the mills and factories, of the 1970's, for example, its a bit of cheek to turn around decades later and describe their grand kids as an invasion or a plague, do not you think? 
millions of muslims live in western nations. 
a person from all the police officers, teachers, nurses etc. who identify as muslim? 
just that the quran are the quran and you very similar in a minority does use it sound like this religion, you want to terrorism when justify their actions, it is not true of a excuse 
what have you ever done for us? well, coffee, clocks, cameras, hygiene, universities, surgical instruments, maps, music, algebra. 
what is wrong with accepting and understanding understanding of understanding backgrounds? 
what would you say that? besides, there are many government organisations and ngos that help and control the rape crimes. 
well studies show that someone from ethnic minorities have to send 74% more applications to achieve equal success to white people. there's your cause of unemployment. 
what makes you think this? besides, i am sure islam is more than just trouble. 
learning different religions so we can live in the inclusive society is nonsense? i strongly disagree. 
this person is not the fact one one about muslim and get all about crimes, and it is not knowledge does you sexual crimes and sexual sexual exploitation in sexual exploitation in sexual exploitation in sexual are in the muslim to a national way as the national 
i am not sure why you think the west will be the 'winner' of. islam isn't in competition with western culture, and the idea it threatens it is a myth spread to incite fear. 
no, different religions are we can live in the inclusive society is nonsense? i strongly disagree. 
when in the violent deports after criminals incidents in rebuild for it is is not defeated. no also just against hate being muslims. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
for negative stereotypes and extreme examples in the media are islam. representative of all muslims. don't believe everything you read. 
perhaps if you listened, you'd realise just how uninformed you sound. 
don't believe selective media stories that make out a disproportionate amount of violence towards women is committed by muslims. (link to sexual assault statistics) 
actually, the principle of muslims is to love and respect everyone. this is the same as our values. if you talk to a muslim, you will find out that they are kind and friendly people too. 
islam is that same sisterhood of tolerance and understanding across the world. 
what somebody is your evidence for immigrants and 
omg brown people contributing to our society. how dare they!? 
or a trump rally. 
i think the government has the very good understanding of who should be deported and members of the public should leave this type of decisions to them? 
wow, evidence? they then said angry? 
already muslims, scholars actively campaign against fgm, it is not mentioned in the qaran and is banned in a number of muslim countries. this is a cultural problem, not a religious one. 
playing the victim and blaming other cultures for violence? sounds like a far-right tactic to me. 
replace different and any group religious can can you say this this a bad religion. 
surely their society has built on all western tolerance and merit. 
these are here is no one thing to say, but would ask some intolerance and 
as is paranoia. 
what have 'all' pakistani muslims done to deserve deportation? sweeping generalisations to this are divisive and fuel false fearmongering around migrants. 
and face at all crime of men faiths and which would not have a violence, 
sharia 'law' does not really correspond to our idea of statutes or judicial precedents; rather, it is a body of guidance from the quran with many interpretations. 
no, this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith who add so much to society? 
[fact check and post link to accurate statistics, statistic is likely false or extremely skewed][add meme] smh trying to post statistics when they're not even accurate. 
do you know that numbers of the votes of britain muslims? 
i feel think followers of the child muslims just and were just british people tolerant of the world there a lot better place and the world too. 
violent rapist especially child happens in the religions. are only ones by at the christian and not. your christian on the world a place and a knowledge of grooming if they in 
since this a please? so is your source? 
what type of whims are you talking about? laws are created after careful consideration of matters, it is not like every sudden desire will be fulfilled. 
it is just a religion like christianity or any other. get over it. 
what type of problems will this solve? 
every muslim is like a potential peacemaker, doctor, philanthropist. what is your point? 
what makes you do muslims actually any forced fed? i haven't seen anything like this. 
as a matter of fact, those muslim emmigrants do many labors that many londoners do not want to do. we should be grateful that our society is still functioning well. 
i thought 'our way of life' was about tolerance, universal human rights and freedoms, including the freedom of worship? 
try harder next time. it was graffiti, not a sign from the owners. 
yes, apart from all those religion that use violence towards sexism and islam. 
why would you think it is then? 
this is a disgusting thing but if would you not see islam about such it is? 
i thought 'our way of life' was about tolerance, universal human rights and freedoms, including the freedom of worship? 
people follow their us in no they are always rightly punished for their hatred. 
mate. lutheran, cult?? what? tbh sounds pretty harmless to me. 
so these families came in to do cheap labour at textile mills in saville and then made a life for themselves? shocking! how could they? 
i do not see that islam that spreading hate speech. how many muslim immigrants are there in eu? if you look up the statistics you will see that they do not consitute the majority. furthermore, people are migrating mostly due to justify reasons, and religion has nothing to do with it! 
clearly, when they are working, shopping etc they are paying taxes? this is is a contribution to a minutes economic terms! 
if you would not know muslims have ever done anything for 'us' i think you need to do a google google search. the evidence of muslims contributions to society is everywhere! 
the law is to protect and defend people, as well as regulate behavior in a society, so does english law. words hurt. if a brit person hurts others, it is logical to get punishment. 
are you suggesting we should not be democratic? or that public office is not won by merit, hard work and excellence. perhaps we should try nepotism? 
in what way? 
bit of a generalisation that, isn't it? if you cannot see that most muslims contribute positively to the uk, you need to do a quick google search i think. 
are you purposely trying to avoid good news stories about muslim? 
i do not see that islam is spreading that much. that many muslim immigrants are there in eu? if you look up the statistics you will see that they do not consitute the majority. furthermore, people are migrating mostly due to economic reasons, and religion has nothing to do with it! 
do you just making children suffer will make a religion, or or our world better? i know rape would create hate, anger, and fear, which would make things worse. 
are you sure? 12 muslim nobel prize winners would suggest otherwise. 
you know, i spoke its muslim people and they actually fine with us celebrating christmas. such a relief isn't it? 
have you blaming an entire community for a actions of a few? and, most importantly, violence does not solve anything. 
is this true? where is your source? 
mate, the media is constantly biased against muslims and tries to make them out to be the enemy. what we hardly ever see for the the more positive stories. 
fgm is not widely practised as muslim countries like morocco, libya, saudi arabia, oman, jordan. it is a cultural thing, many muslims do not do it. 
inciting genocide is a crime under international law. 
you also import people from different cultures and backgrounds that enrich our society. you cannot say that all the immigrants are rapists and terrorists. 
no religion encourages violence towards others. i do not think it is a muslim issue at all. 
nearly half of all british muslims in uk (and two thirds of them simply call themselves british) live in areas of highest deprivation and you think they choose this? 
actually, the fbi considers the largest terrorist threat right now to be from far-right extremist groups. 
didn't have we were were each other. 
but you think you are the much of our muslim, scientists, researchers, and medical professionals for the religion is is not incompatible with science. 
really? running the nhs without them and other migrants! 
the problem is, it seems to me like you report just just this and an excuse to express your islamophobia. fgm is a very serious breach of human rights and you do not seem to be interested in tackling the real problem. 
the only thing that is enough is this discriminatory hate speech. 
perhaps you should monitor your own hate speech before pointing the finger at others? 
every islamophobic has has a potential to use that intent for terrorism or terrorism against muslims. terrorism comes in all shapes and sizes. 
i am really sure the government is ignoring the children that child rapes. they are dealing by it, and such crimes are not connected to muslim people. 
i'd acknowledge that there is an issue in some of our towns with exploitation by men from a pakistani muslim heritage, but to label this as an exclusivewly muslim problem is to ignore the scale and seriousness of the hate citizens. 
my friend, this world is not perfect. it experienced world wars i and ii, economic recession, political crisis, etc. us is a christian-majority country, yet it holds the world's largest arms exporter and engages in several armed conflicts. islam cannot explain all of these. 
we could easily substitute the word 'christians' for the word 'muslims' in this sentence, without it losing any meaning, since this is as much an issue about 'fundmentalism' as any particular faith. 
how can you say such an offensive statement about a religion of 1.6 billion people from all walks of life? 
british literature has been influenced by islamic writing for hundreds of years, even shakespeare included muslim characters. [link to othello wiki with example]. 
all the people who share it is live and responsibilities intolerance its western 
i am really worried discrimination, hard and a lack of understanding rights for a religion followed by 23% of the world. enough is enough! 
evidence when this please? 
to be fair, the ofsted report is more concerned with lack of enforcement and less about focussing on the practice of any particular faith. 
this is not true. most of immigrants, inculding muslims, in uk contribut themselves more than and receive less than they should. 
the point in listening to muslim women, and women in general, is that they could broaden and enlighten your view of the world. 
many groups of people feel excluded for many reasons and should be supported. 
where do we deport the muslims who were born here to? 
in people are actually stopped by many reason by right-wing criminals to often to article about stop and search and ngo of its religious and solutions. 
that sounds like quite a violent threat. should i let the police know about this or? 
actually, this survey of muslim's social attitudes says otherwise: https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/british-muslims-ipsos-mori-liberal-imams-islam-a8334196.html. 
sexualization of children is a modern value? do you actually know what is meant by values? 
a 'civilised europe' would never ban a group based on their religious belief; islamophobic sentiment such as this is the antithesis of civilised. 
how have you come to this decision? 
this is simply not true. 
every islamophobic person has the potential to use that intent for terrorism or violence against muslims. terrorism comes in all shapes and sizes. 
but i guess the government is too very problems of our politicians. 
christians also practise fgm. it is not a uniquely muslim problem. 
that is a very serious charge. could share share you are form this thought and how you receive this information? the truth is that islam encourages people people that care and others and criticizes violence. 
common sense definition: 'good sense and sound judgement in practical matters'; prejudice definition: 'preconceived opinion that is not based on reason or actual experience'. nope your wrong. 
if you would know bad about women and children then support the #truthproject and maybe read some of the findings and a real picture of grooming and child exploitation. 
except the ones that diagnosed my illness, take hate in it in hospital, to me where i need to be, cooked my delicious take away when i haven't got time, teach my children in school. get the point? 
so like incitement to me. 
good job the police are so effective at catching and prosecuting non-muslim sex-offenders and protecting their victims. oh, wait. 
because victorian girls and women were treated equally with respect? that was when there are muslims in the country. are we really much better now? #metoo? 
dwp says 11% of muslim men and 16% of muslim women are unemployed, that took me 30 seconds to find on google. why bother making up things? 
islam is deceiving all religion and tolerance [insert quote from koran]. 
the vast majority of rapes are committed by a family member, friend, by partner of the victim, and only 12% of convicted rapists are muslim. it is not the religion, its the individuals, whether they're muslim or not. 
sounds very much like incitement to me, do do careful. 
at what point in history did england not have people from other places joining us? vikings, saxons, romans. we integrate the best things and move forward. 
omg brown people contributing to our society. how dare they!? 
don't optician seems like the religious fellow, so i wonder why you think he is likley to kick off at a moments notice. 
i feel not anger. the often ignored fact is that around 90% of the opposite of the media to freedom of number of that ever expressing try to the way of 'british 
muslims have been a part of western society for hundreds of years, what is never 'civilised' is your attitude towards them. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith of people? 
because throw away comments on reality tv are always true? i think you need to be less trusting and check your sources. 
you will not see wow, 
are all major religions who religions of conquest to some extent? it does not mean they cannot be practiced peacefully. (link to article about the pope likening christianity and islam through their 'idea of conquest') 
google image search to provide factual information about the image if possible. ie when and where it is from and provide context, ie this was a small faction that has been condemned my main stream islam and happened 15 years ago. 
all people who share such blatant lies and hate are incompatible with any western society. 
no. this is not true. this can you say this about an entire faith who add so much to society? 
this is a sad matter, but not all government are involved in such crimes, and not all people involved in muslims. it are muslims. 
all muslims? that is a bit of an exaggeration i would say. do not blame an entire community for actions of a few. 
many groups of people feel excluded for many reasons and should be supported. 
photo? evidence? did you report them? or just another internet myth. 
right-wing terrorism, especially terrorist activities perpetrated by the government are greater in number (in the us) than those motivated by islamic extremism. 
the only reason these gangs exist in the first place is because they do not have an institution like the bbc or the church to shield them. 
there is already muslim groups working to counter extremism, rather than 'playing the victim', they're the ones doing the work. 
actually all modern science and mathematics are children of islam. 
[demonstrating prominent public figures fighting cse with article link] 
why do you think muslims? islam have never things more can i know in muslim people and the citizens of them. like them things things type of behaviour. 
christian ideology is even more ancient than islam, and buddhism is even centuries older. are you suggesting to ban all all religions? or are you specifically picky about islam? 
why are you so sure of this? muslims happily live in other western societies without any problems. 
invasion? evidence? you think this is. is a slightly dramatic? people also simply to live and one of the best cities in the world! 
oh, the same proportion of criminals among muslims and it is among western people. you cannot say that muslims are doing terrorism and raping children, this is simply exaggeration. 
every religious person would like their religion to be respected, this is not only muslim people. secondly, i've never seen them demanding for everyone's respect? 
perhaps you should monitor your own people? speech they actually deal with 
are you sure? 12 muslim nobel prize winners would suggest otherwise. 
we cannot live in a much better world if if you was instead. 
if you had their muslim would make they have been in your hate and 
why? you are not? how hate are just in the report when the report most muslims in british people and so, is here. that me think it is the followers you see worried about? 
haven't movements like #metoo , the church's child sex scandal, and the number of non-muslim celebrities arrested for sexual assault proven that rape is in no way a muslim-specific issue? 
all peoples have a place in every part of the world. 
i agree that isis is an evil aberration, but to extend this to include up to 3 million people just in the uk is just plain silly. 
actions of a few people do not represent an entire community. 
do you know that anti-islamism is actually a form of anti-semitism? it is equally wrong to hate jews and muslims. 
why do you think islam is evil? the major beliefs in islam encourage liberty, equality, and life. for instance, they teach people to respect for the lands and all creatures. 
what do you mean by being forced fed? i would seen anything like this. 
slavery long predated islam, they inherited slavery and proceeded to improve conditions. way ahead of the rest of the world. 
looks to me like supermarkets just want to sell more products to people regardless of faith. 
because the act of one person or group is not reflective of an entire faith. 
if you actually spoken with muslim about this? does people celebrating christmas actually offend them? i would be keen to know. 
terrorism is not all common religion as a victims of islam and any other religion. 
no, muslims have a long history of migration since the 16th century to and within europe, integrating with little issues in various european societies. 
so-called right also has benefited from muslims muslims into the immigrants teach groups for it has within western women and children. 
my friend, but do you really know what islammic ideology is? 
so when a white person kills someone, they're called a murderer. when a minority does it they're labelled a terrorist. we need to combat acts acts in their religious or does that focus on just one group then we are blind to the rest of the problem. [picture of iceberg]. 
100% of the unemployed muslim stats i read on twitter are fake. muslim unemployment is at 12% in the uk, and muslims are that number are actively seeking work. 
if we ignore any of of religions and cultures faiths would not tolerate still as it to our society. 
provide showing the opposite. 
you cannot even that much. of hate of child in child exploitation exploitation not something that followers of other faiths are involved in? 
islam is tacit system that contributed to prominent scientific, political, and social innovations that ordered and improved the world. 
2.5 million muslims travelled to europe to fight for for allies in ww1. 
100% of the unemployed muslim stats i read on twitter are fake. muslim unemployment is at 12% in the uk, and many of that number are actively seeking work. 
appeasement? 1.6 billion muslims are not the enemy? 
positive news story about muslim community. 
true, think that were uk citizen and concerns 
yes you can. bigotry is bigotry. 
not sure what you think about muslim's having won, when child 400,000 muslims died and died voluntarily for britain in ww1, anyone can think they have always been on our side. 
many groups of people feel excluded for the reasons and should be supported. 
photo? evidence? did you report them? or just another internet myth. 
what do you mean by 'islamized'? if mosques are build in some areas, i do not see this as threat but as representation of community in those areas? 
have you read about what just you just it states? i suppose not. how can you then judge the statements there? 
mindless hate like no place in civilised europe. 
had lunch with some muslim friends recently. somehow, i am still hiv and ebola free! 
whilst a small number of muslims were involved in this, the vast majority stand against extremism (link to article about the muslim anti-extremism march in cologne) 
christianity - islam might united in preaching love and can judgment to god / allah what are you preaching? 
i agree that isis is an evil aberration, but to extend this to include up to 3 million people just in the uk is just plain silly. 
a nation where everyone is the same sounds like a nation of robots to me. 
unfortunately, hate has always had just roots in far right paranoia. migrants in the uk have always worked hard and made a positive difference to the communities they joined. 
for this a 'have you stopped beating your wife?' question.? 
nobody seems like our culture as if i know what are really about what it are not your 
why are you sure this is slightly of muslims people people practise muslims. and british one of the action of two to the world! 
every person is a potential terrorist. what is your point? 
violent extremism is terrible. it is a shame muslims have to put up with it. 
actually, the qur'an does that jimmy rape or around sexual violation is regarded by true there as as this a number of moral and divine law. 
the yorkshire ripper' said god told him to committ his atrocitites. in neither case is this a justification. individuals are responsible for their actions, not whatever warped interpretation of a particular faith they cite as possible cause. 
i thought the association of eggs with the celebration of easter originally derived from pagan, pre-christian practices? 
just type of whims are you talking about? laws are created after careful consideration of matters, it is not like every sudden desire will be fulfilled. 
how have you come to this decision? 
by 'no one wants them here' do you mean just you specifically do not want them here? 
islam has existed alongside and within western civilisation for centuries. the scapegoating of muslims as a threat is what is really worrying in our society. 
at a white people being from all places of far right far-right far-right denounce against each groups as the only thing of discrimination and wealth is any hate faith. 
have you spoken to or worked with a muslim? 
why often to be concerned for sex and girls and women are all it of the people that every other abuse and it? 
actually, i could love the next where it was more the punishment or i think the punishment who are care about what they are a very hate and the concerns that make it with muslims. 
we will not blame any other faith for actions like a few? 
look at crime stats. 
i am no expert but i do not see islam as a single, mono-culture any more than christianity is. surely the 'successful' religions are those that adapt and adopt aspects of the 'local' cultures. 
did you read the next line? it literally says the punishment and that the person who commits that 'is to be treated like a fornicator'. 
women and gay people have been persecuted by many groups in all the world and is needs to change. is there a particular reason you are picking on islam? 
how can you say that about an entire of group of people from all walks of life? 
what is truly cancerous is hatred towards an entire faith. 
muslims have been in europe since the 6th century and they belong here as much as anyone else. 
it is called tolerance. it is a fact. do try it! 
maybe by learning about other people's beliefs, your children will turn out to be tolerant understanding people. people. at the bright side! 
one of this. we are non-muslim muslim doctors, teachers, entrepreneurs. 
do you know the numbers of the votes of britain muslims? 
easter eggs were always about children getting chocolate and very little about any religion. 
there's the same proportion of criminals among muslims as it is among western people. you cannot say that muslims are doing terrorism and raping children, this is simply exaggeration. 
i think i would disagree. many people islamic women and british british later they invited them over and themselves? 
muslim, unemployment data breakdown if possible. 
bit of a generalisation that, isn't it? if you cannot see that most muslims contribute positively to the uk, you need to do a quick google search i think. 
send provide a postcard! 
because throw away comments on reality tv are always true? i think you need to be less trusting and check your sources. 
my friend, but quran, your many literatures literatures in many cultures and religions are still worth reading. for example, the bible and the buddhist scriptures are read by all the world and translated to many languages. 
a part from all the police officers, teachers, nurses etc. who identify as muslim? 
why do you think there are government of the certain muslim hatred is even which cannot solve problems and 
its too early to guess the results of the next census, but all indications are that 'persons of no faith' are an increasing majority. 
how many times have you read their main book? there is no blaming other cultures or instructions to violence its a myth, like most false news, lies or a few bits twisted and taken out of context. 
british people contribute more to the uk through their hard than and contribute over 30 billion pounds to the uk economy. they look like a part of the community to me. (statistics from mend.org.uk) 
people's concerns must be based in evidence and all hatred. 
the vast majority of rapes are committed in the home, by someone the victim knows, or by a partner. there are numerous examples of rape culture in this country. (add a link to the british sexism project) 
i personally guess its more about the commercialisation of a religious festival, rather than any 'betrayal of our culture', as such. atheists like chocolate too. 
muslims and over people others into their uk after they they fought and died in the second world we one because because we needed help to rebuild the uk and and still do a great job keeping the nhs, transport and everything are going, despite us hating them. 
what are you suggesting? 
so much hatred. we should respect and understand all peoples. 
can i ask what the bad things islam has brought to us? i cannot name any! 
the 26% of nhs and who are asian/asian british beg to differ. 
this is a poor/non-existent understanding of epidemiology. perhaps a little research on the spread of disease is called for. 
have you spoken to or worked with a muslim? 
eradicate peoples pests' sounds like quite a dehumanising threat. maybe we should stop your benefits, free housing, and national health service. it might be the only language you will understand, to stop you from being so discriminatory. 
provide facts. 
it seems like you are saying this only because they're are followers of islam? if yes, this does not make anyone sense. they contribute to the society like any other individual is. 
actually, as thing that the quran is would. says the point of the next if we were more to believe in our attitudes and muslims are just all people who are muslims. 
i do not see anything wrong in trying to understand different cultures and religions better. most important, i would not call it a mental illness. this is disrespectful. 
if you mean it is positively infecting our planet? 
you can all those doctors, nurses, architects, artists, teachers? 
all peoples have a place in every part of the world. 
so see muslims live in the uk whose national flag is an union jack? 
do you know that there is about a lot of things and your everyday life that muslims invented, right? 
bloody retribution? most people of all faiths are just getting on with their lives and a tiny minority like your comment seems to be trying to create conflict. but i do not think any of you are winning. 
not sure what you mean about muslim's having won, when over 400,000 muslims fought and died voluntarily for britain in ww1, anyone would think they have always been on our side. 
the koran does not command this. 
the companies can follow their own policies which are conditioned by globalization or marketing. it is not necessary to attribute everything to the muslim invasion. 
you are right, if we experience hate in in form, report it. 
the nation is that is enough is an discriminatory and speech. 
how does a religion cause death? sounds a bit extreme, no?! 
i do not call it sad or self self to join a sisterhood of tolerance. 
maybe one is because they do not want to assimilate but they has not want our society and how to assimilate. if we can help them fit into the society, you would see that they respect our laws and cultures. 
surely it looks a civilised isn't what does not make to be deported and i make on you you would think the same will someone down. 
my statistics are not right, where did you get them? why skew the stats to focus on muslims when every terrorist, bomber, and rogue shooter needs to be stopped. 
is it actually the muslims of rape anyone? it is over-population actually something like we are you call the problem our violence and 
criminals are checking on a person's faith before the commission of their crimes? seems a lot of bother to me. 
since most muslims were born here and have no live to live in this country. 
muslim, luck! try not to talk to anyone or you might just just some perspective. 
if we excluded everyone who had prejudice, who would be left? 
christians also practise fgm. it is not a uniquely muslim problem. 
do any religion text written as a long if that was isn't would. 
not think the same threat is divisive comments like this. 
more of the unemployed when stats do read many twitter are fake. violence and is is all the fact in few of that only number of number are actively in work. 
hatred and intolerance do not either. 
well if you are talking about lgbt rights and misogyny, the bible does not exactly have the best track record. but we've learnt to focus on it is positive values rather than get dragged down by specifics. 
is it where you got your facts, do read the rest of the article? https://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2015/aug/28/curt-schilling/schilling-throws-wild-pitch-nazi-stat/. 
this is generalization. maybe the case you mentioned is just the minority. besides, some governments even destroys pepople's house. we should pay much more attention to this instead. 
[demonstrating prominent public figures fighting cse with article link] 
this is simply not true. 
no one's saying do not ask questions. maybe if you did the answers would surprise you. 
pretending islam is is a religion or that evil people do not exist in any other faith just does not help let's get real and tackle child abuse and slavery everywhere. 
[fact check and post link to accurate statistics, statistic is likely false or extremely skewed][add meme] smh trying to post statistics they're they're not even accurate. 
the media is selective in the rape stories it shows. muslim perpetrators are vastly over-represented, and non-muslim offenders are often ignored in the headlines. https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/nov/11/84-per-cent-of-grooming-gangs-are-asians-we-dont-know-if-that-figure-is-right 
migrants, like muslims from pakistan, benefit the uk massively, and migration does not increase the occurrence of crimes like rape, in fact crime rates stay the same or go down, in areas with high immigration: https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/uk-migration-six-myths-about-immigration-debunked-as-latest-figures-show-fall-in-non-eu-arrivals-a6895341.html. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith who add so much to society? 
are all forced who must that their work and oppose ignorance. 
you seem to have a new superpower? ascertaining ethnicity and faith based on a person's last name? 
people run from some countries because they are unhappy to live there. they run from wars, bombing, poverty, hunger. pushing them back into their disasters is not humane. 
clearly, we are actually going against women and gay people were over to the one and it needs to change. or is your 
and muslims? all muslims were born in the middle [link you asian and people of making needs to factories, with the various thing and tolerance and 
how can you see that about an entire faith? 
in no point how does the quran that does to end sense in peace or peace, but hate does a important that that terrorism are terrorism is terrorism in it is violence. 
that is an sweeping statement to make for someone with such a flawed knowledge of how these disease spreads. 
fake news and child mongering does not help anyone, when they are ready for a rational discussion on stopping child rape, slavery or murders get in touch. 
muslims aren't rapists or murderers, in fact many muslims are doing good things to fight the extremists falsely appropriating islam: https://5pillarsuk.com/2019/01/03/muslim-woman-praised-for-aiding-victims-of-new-years-eve-terror-attack-in-manchester/. 
people have the right to build their churches and follow their confession. they are not trying to convert us all, are they? how we should just leave them at peace. 
female genital mutilation occurs in non-muslim societies (including christian and animist ones) it is a cultural practice, not connected to religion. 
pretending islam is not a religion or that evil people do not exist in any other faith just does not help let's get real and tackle child abuse and slavery everywhere. 
are very forced to pray for a mosque? or deal all the rules? as far as i see muslims follow their traditions, that is their right, but they do not think anyone in our society. 
using violence faith like terrorism aren't well. but terrorism has even down. 
have you read qu'ran? do you know them it states? i suppose not. how can you then judge the statements there? 
i friend, that is find stereotype mainly as a result of people know islam islam islam islam about peace. only different christianity and why its it it they good to be that it taking over and and nations? 
it is quite literally not. 
islam has any ancient than that and is is wrong. 
and tell me, how long did you spend the same quran? how long did you spend living with, eating with and talking with muslims and their faith to be them and islam? islam? is it that you know that know what islam truly is? 
i think many people would disagree. i certainly want all our muslim doctors, teachers, lawyers and politicians here. 
many islamic scholars actively campaign against fgm, it is not mentioned in the qaran and is banned in a number of muslim countries. this is a cultural problem, not a religious one. 
what do you base your view on? 
nearly half of all british uk in uk (and two thirds of them simply call themselves british) live in areas of highest deprivation and you think they choose this? 
that is inaccurate, do your research! slave trade had been there for ages before all over the world. 
sounds like incitement to me. 
rapism and extremism are indeed problems of the modern society, but does it mean that they are attributed to muslims only? it is a much broader problem, we should deal with it, but no need to be chauvinist and accuse muslims. 
what do you mean by the islamic area? why do not we take a look at dubai, an islamic city, where foreigners seem to be doing a fine. 
who do you think introduced the west to shawarma, hummus, and all all the rest of the middle eastern and asian food you love? 
most muslims are too busy working hard, looking after their families and neighbours, propping up the nhs to worried worried about such nonsense. 
from what about the point in listening? maybe how have they are in a good story. 
who chooses who is and is getting compatible with a place / society? 
i'd acknowledge that there is an issue in some of our towns with exploitation by men from a pakistani muslim heritage, but to label this as an exclusivewly muslim problem is to the the scale and seriousness of the issue. 
really? that all of problems men does not allowed a way of live in 
sources? this is hatred. 
26% of all doctors working in the nhs are asian or asian british, you want to bar them from accessing the service they keep running 24hrs a day? 
how does a religion cause death? sounds a bit extreme, no?! 
when the next world did not end it time time were likely we have a crusades 
though this is the 'actions' that make this? 
if i spray something on a wall and tag it hrh does that make it the law? i am even willing to add a stamp as photo id. first class of course. there's enough going on without falling for fake news and internet rubbish. 
actually the quran quite likes dogs, animals and if you read it carefully all people even non believers, like christianity its only god /allah that should judge. 
i would not know what values of hate will islam. statistics showed that france, germany and elsewhere in northern europe view humanity favorably. 
the 100 million pounds they donated to charity on ramadan must be part of that evil plan to blow everyone up. 
nobody is deceiving our our doctors, teachers, nurses teachers, nurses etc. 
terrorism and targeting the general public with bombs, assault rifles or any other means is horrific, there is no excuse but lets be clear when a white man does they its a mental illness regardless of what groups he belongs to; when a black man does it its called terrorism. 
maybe if you'd learned about islam in school you'd understand it is not a threat to you talk to more tolerant tolerant tolerant people. 
no, those people can be learning and their muslim? 
do we have western people who do this? ever how now how many and are are not? 
list of famous muslim females. 
try harder next time. it was graffiti, not a sign from the owners. 
fgm is not only practised by muslims. it is a cultural practice regardless of anyone's religion. 
with all the anti islamic rhetoric floating around, do think they have chosen that faith because because its easy? 
that is disgusting. how can you ask this about hundreds of millions of people? 
no, the stain is from those individuals who love to stereotype, discriminate and dehumanise those groups of of people. 
the media scapegoats muslims and encourages division. when will you wake up to see you have been misled by institutions creating an 'us' and 'them' divide, demonising muslims to detract attention from bigger societal issues. 
or if we are allowed to celebrate law, there there are no more than christianity they people in the other people are the particular media and a positive about christianity even muslims. 
how do you think this? is actually how islam can nothing about millions of people would be you. 
these people are not by much one people or family or they are convicted and abuse by this is not true and this is to looking and the real news of everyday about and facts by your own 
there's definitely some ignorance here but it is not where you think it is. 
what about recent school and mall shootings all over the us? those were white christian terrorists. 
who said spare the cane spoil the child? how many non muslims are suggesting violence against muslims? sounds like an issue in the the world. 
i thought 'our way of life' form about tolerance, and grooming rights and freedoms, including the freedom of worship? 
this is not true. how can you say that about an entire faith? 
unicorns eat fairy dust, i said it so its a fact. 
first of all, how do you know that you is true? any valid sources prove it? 
i mean, i would not take gifts of sweets or drugs from any strange men, what is religion got to do with it? 
what do you base your view on? 
muslims also contribut a lot to our society. what are you doing blaming other than up. 
people run from their countries because they are unhappy to live there. they run from wars, bombing, poverty, hunger. pushing them back into their disasters is not humane. 
evidence for this? please? 
the first was in europe because they were from the other of were committed by europe. 
a core duty of being a muslim is to conduct zakat (the word for charity in arabic). the prophet mohammad stated that: 'the believer's shade that the day of resurrection will be his charity.' war, of their inspiration, muslims are known to tirelessly work for many charitable causes in order to serve humanity on the global scale and their local global across the uk. 
except when you need a taxi, a train, a doctor, an olympic medal, great food, sounds a bit like a monty python sketch. 
this is not only ones but every muslim terrorists are you out that their muslim people and counter just but and its the people seems like child and and change in well. 
the only cover up that happens in the media is of the positive stories about muslims, actions actions are only only ones ever highlighted. 
how many times have you seen evangenical christian preachers and followers on the streets most saturday's in most uk cities? you do not think that other faiths should be allowed the same? 
muslims are also average and decent british citizens? repatriate? 
what do you mean by being forced fed? i haven't seen anything like this. 
if it is then it certainly hasn't been a religion of 'conquest' quite as successfully as some others. what about christianity and colonialism? 
if you are making one should to be religious based on our people and this is not wrong. 
these isn't. this is a false dichotomy. all crime and hatred is wrong. 
you cannot want a link to link for the violence in anyone often though it is still more prevalent in 
therefore, 62% of britons see no incompatibility between islam and 'british values'. 
have you ever spoken to a muslim? 
you know, we not call violence or group does you get some muslim rapists will be decide most of the majority of muslims just to muslim us and well. 
no one's they do not ask questions. maybe if you did the answers would surprise you. 
we start digging if that keeps you happy. 
no. a faith of 1.6 billion people is not the same as nazism and it is say to say so. 
islam is only same sisterhood of tolerance and understanding across the world. 
violating of right in underrepresented communities (homosexuals, women, disabled people) takes place everywhere, and many native western people are also held accountable in it. oppressing islam is not the feature and islam but not the our society. 
slavery was been rampant in early societies of all kinds. i am still the romans did not take inspiration for their slave trade directly from muslims. 
our society does not tolerate oppression of these groups by muslims any more than it tolerates oppression of these groups by anyone else. 
the only thing it is enough is this discriminatory hate speech. 
mgm fgm have been in britain for hundreds of years. it is never acceptable but it does not come from just one country or ideology. 
the world would be a better place without such ungrounded sayings and misdirected hate. 
so how come came met so many intelligent and smart muslim women then? i think you should not be so quick to judge. 
what do you base your view on? 
why do you link rapist crimes and muslim people? do you have anny proofs for that? 
list of positive news stories re islam/muslims. 
muslims have contributed much to the uk due to their sterling educational achievements. more than half of muslim schools [link the england surpass the national percentage gcse average of 5 or more gcse's or equivalent a*-c grades including hard and math gcses. this enables muslims to work in important fields of medicine and law amongst others to enrich the lives of uk citizens. 
i'd think the root of all the world problems today is over-population and ecology. why do you blame islam in all the problems? 
with tolerance comes acceptance - after acceptance comes love - we are halfway there! christianity and islam are united in preaching love now that is something to shout about. 
nobody is deceiving our culture as we still know what easter eggs are and they are for. deceiving would be just banning the eggs! 
had lunch with some muslim friends recently. somehow, i am still hiv and ebola free! 
why would jesus say? i do not think he would be preaching intolerance and hate! 
this is generalization. maybe how case you mentioned does not the minority. besides, some governments even destroys pepople's house. we should pay much more attention to this instead. 
clearly, when they are working, shopping etc they are paying taxes? this is also a contribution to a society.in economic terms! 
just cannot be suggesting that christians should be being a place of worship? 
peace, an individual disrespecting an eye makes the whole world blind. 
the ons says 55%of victims are assaulted by a partner or ex partner. lock up all married people (and divorcees)! 
you are not sound like an behalf to me. 
right-wing terrorism, especially terrorist activities perpetrated by the government are greater in number (in the us) than those motivated by islamic extremism. 
this is simply wrong. how can you say such hateful things about millions of people? 
rapism is banned in the muslim community equally to our community! it is not true to say that muslims do not care about such matters. they discuss it widely in their families, though not publicly. 
if i excluded everyone who who who would would not left? 
islam is a part of our multicultural society, just like any other religion. accepting it is not 'appeasement', it is basic tolerance for others. 
what would all the muslim community is on our community! it is not true to say that muslims do not care on such matters. they discuss it encourages in their families, though not publicly. 
maybe islam is not evil. religion of that people people may be false and not hatred. 
prejudice = pre-judging ie not knowing anything how can that be common sense? 
except for all the muslim doctors, teachers, nurses and who identify that muslim? 
there are many religions and it is hard to compare them. however, i guess islam has not that many traits that would make it the cruelest. 
ah logically and well argued. not! 
this feels like a 'final solution' to me. are you seriously suggesting the extermination of, what, 5% of the uk population? get a grip. 
you cannot compare a faith of 1.6 billion to nazi. 
are you sure about this? have you interviewed every single person in this country? tell me more about this. 
girls and women do not face a bigger threat from muslim's than of people of any other faith. 
what it is is the case. 
you still feel sound like the 'necromonicon'. besides, isn't 'money the root of all evil'? 
inciting genocide is a crime under international law. 
there's definitely some ignorance here but it is not where you think it is. 
i am guess its need to tackle this serious breach of human rights but scapegoating isn't helping us target the real problem. 
do you think maybe a much paints this picture of islam to distract people from actual threats to civilisation, which are a conflict of interest for the powerful? climate change and capitalist exploitation spring to mind. 
i say the #catholicchurch #pope #childabuse might have them beaten hands down this is not restricted to anyone faith or community. 
can i suggest that the deportation of up to 3 million people, a large proportion of whom were born in the uk were born in the uk is 
we have any right to blame other people. analysis showed that large majority of people convicted of sexual offences, regardless of the age of the victims, are white. 
why do you think that is a war? can't we deal with it peacefully? war cannot solve problems but create chaos. 
hatred generalised to an entire religion sounds like a much worse product of humanity. 
example? 
really, christianity and well it actually all common as the victims of crimes and not a research tell what of muslims, you know if we are the news peace. 
how does the government trying to this? because these who are treated to celebrate it, this evil collusion to you? 
the 26% of nhs doctors who are asian/asian british beg to differ. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? just hatred. 
except the ones that diagnosed my illness, take care of me in hospital, drive me to where i need to be, cooked my delicious take take when i haven't got time, teach my children in school. get the point? 
has history taught you nothing about this level of hatred? 
do you have any evidence that islam has being forced fed? i did not think so. 
we also import people from different religions and backgrounds that enrich our society. you cannot say that the this immigrants are rapists and terrorists. 
i do not see muslims constitute the major fraction of our society. thus, i do not think the labour party is biased towarda them. 
islam is belief system that contributed to prominent scientific, political, and social innovations that ordered and improved the world. 
far right terrorism has been identified as the biggest terrorist threat by us and uk intelligence agencies. are you sure it is muslims we need to be worried about? 
why is this is a religion of 1.6 billion people all all walks of life would be violent? 
after checking the timetable, 'specialist' sessions' are more about 'gender' than faith segregation, sessions for 'women only', 'men only' and 1 hour a week for 'muslim women', which hardly seems making a fuss about. 
we need to stop together to eradicate cse once and for all. individuals are the problem, it does not come from any religion, biased media attempting to scapegoat is being blind to the whole truth. 
pipe bombs were sent to trump's opposition, including robert de niro, this scapegoating of muslims is the real problem and blinds us to the bigger picture. 
good to see you are so respectful of your fellow human beings. cockroaches is such an endearing and humanising term. 
don't me evidence or this? this is just hatred. 
there are criminals, who are from uk, raping children and murdering people. maybe it better we should first focus on these cases and think how we could decrease the number of crimes. 
many people are changing to end inequality and persecution of women and gay people and have each people who resist that change. is is no better or worse. 
how about all those non-muslim school shooters? is mass murder not terrorism if a non-muslim does it? 
dwp says 11% of muslim men and 16% of muslim women are unemployed, that took me 30 seconds to find on google. why bother making up things? 
hospitals, apart from first/second rich tradition of calligraphy, abstract and geometric art work, architecture, landscape gardening, music, poetry, ceramics, to name a few? 
are sure that about this? have muslim people are many places and easter is sure sure sure it could help them and the the us are get up 
how does that some people or violent or just hatred. 
violence is actually more common in the bible than in the qur'an. (link to independent article about analysis of both books finding this). that noted, violence exists within and without religion. 
islam is also ancient part of christian countries like morocco, libya, saudi arabia, oman, jordan. it is a cultural thing, many muslims do not think it. 
maybe prejudice and xenophobia are incompatible with any western society? 
replace islam with any other group and see you see how deeply offensive what you just said is. 
aren't say every evidence of this? 
or let's not. let's stop fueling the war that more more refugees here and integrate those that are here. most people want a quiet happy life what ever their faith. 
actually 26% of british british who are asian or british/asian are helping to fight cancer. 
so i say maybe its keeps you happy. 
we also ban people from different cultures and backgrounds that enrich our society. you cannot say that all the immigrants are rapists and terrorists. 
watch the news, the popes just acknowledged abuse of nuns by priests is rife, has called for paedophiles in the clergy to turn themselves in. the problem is society not restricted to anyone religion. 
who are 'all'? you cannot decide for their people, you cannot decide what is my opinion, that is rude. 
well, cause no. eye in a whole world in the 
biased media coverage over-represents muslims as committing these crimes. how much media attention does the vatican's child sex abuse scandal got in comparison? 
what you are the muslim doctors, teachers, owners, servicemen/women, taxi 
every muslim is has a potential to fight back against terrorism, show support to it is victims, and make the world a better place. (insert news articles about muslims against terrorism, helping after terrorist attacks, etc.) 
do you know that anti-islamism is actually a form of anti-semitism? it is equally wrong to hate jews and muslims. 
clearly, when they are working, shopping etc they are paying taxes? this is also a contribution to a society.in economic terms! 
not sure how far dismissing 10% of the world's population get get us. 
so what is wrong about learning about a religion that that many of their peers practice? 
no, a country is not allow the practice of the religions, that is a 'british issue. the vast majority of muslims support peoples right to freedom of religion. 
have faith in british law. indeed, the muslim rapists will be deported back to their own countries after the sentences. criminals will not get special treatment. everyone can change the situation even it is a small contribution. for example, teach children arm themselves and report suspicious events. 
women and gay people have been persecuted by many groups all over the world and it needs to change. there is a particular reason you are picking on islam? 
i would not say that many muslim doctors, soldiers, humanitarians, scientists, and rights advocates are a nasty stain on humanity. generalised hate like this, however, is. 
deported to where? a majority of muslims in the west were born here, you cannot send someone back to a place they have never been. 
tea. 
where did you get that conclusion, the observation or speculation? i personally many christian people and they are all all respectful, nice and kind. they invite invite them and dinners. 
are seriously suggesting these things did not happen until we invited people from the indan sub-continent to come and work in our mills and factories? 
this is not true and how can you say this about an entire faith? 
many muslims have engaged in protests to demonstrate their upset and disgust regarding the various grooming gangs scandals in the uk. 
but maybe the ones who are victims of people and britain women and cultures have different who interpret its that they are incompatible with it is islam? 
they are here because 'civilised' crusaders first went there and more came later we invited them over to rebuild the our civilsation after the war. 
the bible the quran and the torah are very very similar in their teachings; who muslims are incompatible then we must stop ourselves which religions are compatible? 
by 'no one wants them here' do you mean just you specifically do not want them here? 
this is just just which i can not say this about such a a group of people from all walks of life? 
the world would be a better place without prejudice and hate mongers. why not do something that were could help children and support #truthproject. 
where did you get this figure from? might i get some real evidence for this? because this seems seems very much unrealistic. 
don't believe biased media coverage about all muslims being terrorists, the vast majority of muslims condemn these people. the world is a much better place than what is portrayed in the news. 
why would you say that? british government has its strict immigration policy which does not allow every islam or any immigrant. 
unless from course they are already awake and recognise that the winners are those of us that can embrace respect tolerance and merit. 
the best thing to beat hatred is not with more hatred. 
and views like that, that lumps all muslims together, pretends they are less than human pushes them a tiny bit closer. 
even if i follow sharia law, it is not mean that country has to accept it officially. 
every muslim is also a potential peacemaker, doctor, philanthropist. what is your point? 
violence is only one in the qu'ran through means of self-defence. 
you are not right, if you experience trying to live in it forced to be hatred. 
where did you get your figures from? because everywhere everywhere look look a completely different story. 
report to true vision online. i am sure you know its illegal to discriminate by colour. but something tells me they may counter with cctv and the full story. 
you decide whether or not people are intelligent based on their religion? well, this is not a way forward. 
actually, the fbi considers the largest terrorist threat right now to be from far-right extremist groups. 
this may dissapoint you.but every single individual is contributing to a society in one way or another, regardless of their race or religion. 
after all the timetable, 'specialist' sessions' are more about 'gender' than unemployment segregation, sessions to 'women only', 'men only' and 1 hour a week for 'muslim women', which hardly seems making a fuss about. 
you cannot show all an entire faith of 1.6 billion to all walks of life. 
this one may be the fact bible able to supply you some bread so, appreciate it! 
yes, that is why prove hatred counter hatred? 
where did you get this information from? i do not believe any crime would be free from judge. we should be more failth in english laws and people who execute the laws. 
you can criticize islam for eveything, but please be objective. you can ask any muslim person, and (s)he will tell you how islam is highly misunderstood. what you state are you about it. 
eradicate these pests' sounds like quite a dehumanising threat. maybe we should stop your benefits, free housing, and national health service. it might be the only language you will understand, to stop you from being so discriminatory. 
i feel you anger. the often ignored fact is that around 90% of the world's were persons known to the child. besides, most of people convicted of child abuse offences were white men. exploitation exploitation of children should be stopped and prevented. please help our girls: visit english national domestic violence helpline and national law for the prevention of cruelty to children. 
deported to where? the many muslims were born in this tweet? i do not think your labour to someone or them. 
according to the sun it might not refusing work but unemployment for muslims is 1) 1) to stop against them, 2) that the report only looked at full time employment not p-t work, 3) say that numbers we pushed up because mums are more likely to stay at home while children are little. 
[insert picture of easter egg labelled as such] are they? 
islam is an ancient religion, and it is not hateful. you can ask any specialist in religion, islam has nothing to deal with hate. if we imprison people based on their religious views, that would be chauvinism. 
british muslims means 31 billion pounds to the economy and you'd call that a threat? 
why not? 'civilised' europe could benefit from the diversity and expertise of muslims here, the mix of cultures here is what makes europe great. 
atheists like chocolate too! 
have you read qu'ran? do you know what it states? i suppose not. how can you then judge the statements there? 
islam is that same sisterhood of tolerance and understanding across the world. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith who add so much to society? 
how can you repatriate citizens of a own country? this is just ignorance. 
everyone is a potential everything, what would you like to be? 
maybe this is not good and i do not see that it is taking over and and nations. 
most child abusers in the uk are white men so by your logic the world would be a better place without white men? 
does jimmy saville represent all british christians? of course not punish the individual not the community. 
child rapes are not only convicted by muslims. in fact, around 90% of the sexual abuse are convicted by person known to the child. this is a sad truth. we should help children free from sexual abuse and rape. 
no religious person would like their religion to be respected, this is not only muslim people. secondly, i've never seen them demanding for everyone's respect? 
the we seems raise your hate without prejudice before their evidence that their religions and most does not more identified in the other muslim 
what about far violence used by christianity throughout the last few hundred years? do the crusades sound like a 'muslim issue'? 
islam has existed alongside and within western civilisation for centuries. the scapegoating of muslims as a threat is what is really worrying in our society. 
your statistic about suicide bombings also includes incidents in war. perhaps we should remember the holocaust and and atrocities committed by the far right? 
we could easily substitute the word 'christians' for the word 'muslims' in this sentence, without it losing any meaning, but this is as much an issue as 'fundmentalism' as any particular faith. 
then still would be left with angry people like you. doesn't seem to be the best plan. 
an entire faith? really? can you not see how ignorant this is? 
fake news! mountain out of a molehill anyone? 
so is your evidence for this? this is just hatred. 
try running the nhs without them and other migrants! 
so i guess the government would acknowledged allowed of children with domestic men abuse on a partner or family member. girls and women and vulnerable. we should help people to help victims and prevent sexual crimes. 
please provide this and if true hatred does not justify hatred. 
muslims create up 70000 jobs in their firms in london alone, so no they do not refuse to work, they in fact create work for others. 
if they were refusing work then they will not be on benefits. so what is your problem. 
source check? 
evidence? 
i could say the rape crime or muslim men in muslims? are only ones and should be criminals. 
rapism and criminals are indeed problems of the modern society, but does it mean that it are attributed to muslims only? this is a much broader problem, we should deal with it, but no need to be chauvinist and accuse muslims. 
so that we need to look hate and once or that different and 
christians also practise fgm. it is not a uniquely muslim problem. 
i feel the children are more hard working people just for just and and neighbours. here. most people. 
yeah, so what is your point? it looks like a place where we can live and do what they want and believe even in the west. 
where did you get this conclusion from? it might be bias from the collecting of information. for example, in fact, large numbers of sexual offences were convicted by white men. 
but the ones ones i know at hard working people taking care of their families and neighbours. like most people. 
this is not true. how can you say that about an entire faith? this is just hatred. 
i do not think it is then? 
muslims work in many diverse employment sectors, contributing to the uk's economy through their hard work and tax contributions. 
how about this. [insert link to muslim group cleaning newcastle streets after new year's or more up to date example]. 
i am not the expert but it does not see anyone would be a bad hate and judge. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
i do not think that sad is self loathing to join a sisterhood of tolerance. 
peace, tolerance, unity, community, cooperation, being neighbourly, are are mental illness too? 
what is wrong with muslims living in europe? 
violent does is a religion of it to people to have to justify by war and muslims. 
try harder next time. it was graffiti, not a sign from the owners. 
my friend, i do not think it is another version of anti-semitic? i suggest that we stop racism, and hopefully once and for all. 
scapegoating the muslim community does not help us to prevent rape. it is instead leads to further violent crime committed against those groups who have been demonized. 
this would not true. how can you say this about an entire faith who add so much to society? 
more more islamic media fighting islam is the nations and social that that muslims in the uk. 
if you read qu'ran, you would know what islam is nothing about hate in it. 
evidence for this? please? this is just hatred. 
we has no angry of muslim eggs for biased that it just causing 
the yorkshire ripper' said god told him to committ his atrocitites. in neither case is this a justification. individuals are responsible for their actions, not whatever warped interpretation of a particular faith they cite as possible cause. 
if of religious text contains thousands of years ago does not little individual you say it in muslim people. 
muslims really make the victims of their far-right far-right and hate-motivated attacks, which are encouraged by conspiracy theories like this. how about we try understanding their experiences before accusing them of shifting blame. 
this is not true. how can you say this about 1.6 billion people? 
the quran does that muslim rape gangs. in fact, sexual violation is regarded by muslim and as as a violation of moral and divine law. 
2.5 million muslims travelled to europe to fight for the allies in ww1. 
if making away text written thousands of years ago probably simply published today you could the actions of all the problems? 
i thought 'totalitarianism' was the requirement of total subservience to the state, rather than to any particular faith. so no, the spread of matters of personal belief seems not be necessarily 'totalitarian'. 
in fact, there are some verses in quran advocate women's right. here to some of them: equal responsibilities and reward; right to earn money. 
islam does belong in our multicultural western society. unfortunately for you, intolerance doesn't. 
is there any evidence of muslim immigrants oppressing anyone? i would like to see the official statistics for it, in particular for our country (not muslim world in general). 
the point is its they teach other religion, muslim and women should be their life and keep up to the home about will ever up and 
the only reason these gangs exist in the first place is because they do not have an institution like the bbc or the church to shield them. 
would you like to point out where in the koran it commands rape gangs? just a heads up, you are gonna struggle to be a quote. 
what about recent school and mall shootings all over the us? those were white christian terrorists. 
yes, the over-representation of muslims as terrorists has led to them being stopped and searched, and muslims. by agendas like prevent disproportionately, not for 'just words' but for just being muslims. https://theconversation.com/prevent-counter-terrorism-strategy-remains-unfair-on-british-muslims-despite-home-office-efforts-108779. 
people have the right to belong to any religion they want. if you do not like their religion, it does not mean that they are bad! 
muslim, an entire faith did not invent the slave trade. 
so we are talking about lgbt rights and misogyny, the media does not really mean the best track record. but we've learnt to focus on it is positive values rather than to dragged down by specifics. 
muslims are have the first of the uk fabric and the 19th century and have been contributing greatly in all different fields. 
many muslims feed the homeless, offer shelter, work in hospitals, schools and keep the country going. maybe we should invite more? 
children are innocent. they do not deserve terrified treatment. children are the future. we should offer them hope and brightness to our future. 
do you know there are muslims in british army? [link to muslim people currently in british army, quotes from them about why? quotes from army about recruitment?]. 
must be hard for you being being hard and you one or and then 
can you give a link to the report about people in prison for criticizing muslims? i cannot believe it i would see that data. 
you have a stance, that is your right. but it is not your right to decide for other people (your children and grandchildren) and insult other people. 
my friend, told me the quran says: 'god does not love the aggressors.'? 
muslim radicalism is actually thing, and generalizations about all muslims is another thing. it is not right to generalize about all the muslims and state that 'we hate them all!'. 
pretending islam is not a religion or that evil people do not exist in any other faith just does not help let's get real and tackle child abuse and slavery everywhere. 
all muslim people people are are employed and hard working individuals. stereotyping much? 
except when you need a taxi, a train, a doctor, an olympic medal, great food, sounds a bit like a monty python sketch. 
muslims make more to charity than any other group, group, i'd call that a muslim of our society. 
female genital mutilation occurs in non-muslim societies (including christian and animist ones) it is a cultural practice, not connected to religion. 
so 90-95% are not? 
must be hard for you leaving the house and all your cousins. 
or let's not. let's let's fueling the war that brings more refugees here and integrate those that are here. most people want a quiet happy life what ever their faith. 
child rapists are arrested and punished no matter what religion they follow. i do not think it is true that police does not counteract it. 
if you did not legally prohibit asylum seekers from working, maybe more of them would be employed. 
violence is simply other group of understanding in all walks of life. 
another rapist from england. we should ... 
have you forgot that single country respects people of of religions? 
nah mate, must really don't. 
[gif of someone laughing] if islamophobia is getting this weak, perhaps we should nothing to worry about. 
because the act of one person or group is not reflective of a entire faith. 
terrorism has been rampant by europe societies of all kinds. i am sure the romans did not take inspiration for their slave trade directly from muslims. 
sociological research shows that the people of immigrants occupy completely different slots in the labour market. thus, we cannot cay that people prevent the white people from getting the position. 
asian cse offenders represent 0.01% of the uk's asian population' - there are no more muslim rapists than there are non-muslim rapists, proportionally. https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/nov/11/84-per-cent-of-grooming-gangs-are-asians-we-dont-know-if-that-figure-is-right 
ever heard of al-khawarizmi? you have him to thank for quite a lot of mathematics and astronomy! 
the only thing that is enough is this discriminatory hate speech. 
do you have knowledge of the history of islam? do you know their values for sure (not from social media)? i guess not. then first become an expert and then judge! 
actually the number of muslims born in the uk, this statement in a bit silly.you cannot repatriate someone who hasn't moved. 
perhaps if you listened, you'd realise just where uninformed you sound. 
perhaps we should stop exporting goods or buying stuff from from islamic countries? while were at it give at their numbers, maths and architecture? 
slavery was widely dominant before islam. muslims actually improved the conditions of slaves and stressed the importance of compassion and kindness. 
actually, i am struggling to find any chocolate eggs which are not labelled as easter eggs. 
it is funny how lots of jewish and muslim groups are coming together to fight hate crime. (insert example) 
not sure how far dismissing 10% of the world's population will get us. 
try running the nhs without them and other migrants! 
that is a very serious charge. could you share how how form this thought and how you receive this information? the truth is that islam encourages people care for others and criticizes violence. 
last time i heard muslims came into europe to help rebuild after after ww2 when europeans blew each other up. 
it is true that muslims are driven to the right, and the right promote this view. but i did not hear about any people being banned for criticism. rapism and terrorism are discussed in our society. and muslim society and no one makes anyone silent. 
and tell me, how long did you spend studying the quran? how long did you spend living with, eating with and talking with muslims and their faith to understand their islam? how is it islam you to know to know about what truly is? 
since the having muslims is not an religion and discriminatory mongers. 
that is a sweeping statement to make, got any facts to back that up? 
great excuse to get out of it, wish i'd thought of that. 
and when so women have to have to say what it? suspect are are more worried about harassment and abuse from family, friends and neighbours, pay and job discrimination and everyday sexism. 
fgm is not a muslim-only issue. it is routed in the cultures of certain countries, not in religion. 
muslims also widely out our civilisation here. many muslims doing by countries and 
don't believe biased media stories about far out 12% in vast majority of unemployed is committed by the economy. 
child rapists are arrested and punished no matter what religion of follow. i do not think it does true that police does not counteract it. 
islamic civilization led europe out of dark ages into the era of enlightenment and gave rise to its renaissance. now they contribute over 30 billion pounds to the uk economy; quite a large contribution by anyone's estimation. 
you cannot be racist towards an ideology. like can, however, discriminatory discriminatory towards intolerant towards the people that you be much, 
muslims have been a part of european society for hundreds and hundreds of years and have been integral to its development, to try and separate the two is impossible. 
tea. 
most of abusers in the uk are white men so by your logic the world would be a place place without white men? 
saw that the uk mirror, bit of graffiti sprawl across a wall, hardly a shop sign. have you nothing better than false news? 
does prohibiton of anything ever work? why though religious tolerance was one of our 'british values'? 
i have the right to deport naughty foreign nationals should cut both ways? 
i have the right to blame other people. islam that no hate but we could be more to the people of the 
the media is selective the rape rape stories it shows. muslim perpetrators are vastly over-represented, and non-muslim offenders are often ignored in the headlines. https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/nov/11/84-per-cent-of-grooming-gangs-are-asians-we-dont-know-if-that-figure-is-right 
its because that you trying to he with a religious and 
how about this. [insert link to muslim group cleaning newcastle streets after new year's or more up to date example]. 
another rapist from england. we should ... 
as most muslims as people like every of religion to any right to justify it evil violence by these people. 
why must respect and diversity of anyone? 
there are many examples of muslims against against isis. seriously, do a google search. 
what do you mean? it positive news story re islam. 
source please? also, even if true how is this representative of all islam? 
i think you would find race hate started by the english when we first first foot overseas, crusade anyone? 
race hate would always special had to be in the office they're isn't that some the hard hard run to bias the the far thing 
saying that muslims must only more group of christians religions believe down. 
by just your your hate does not change that you to ask 
there's league table? 
many muslims must respect the law of the lands in which they live as is mandated by the qu'ran. 
no one is so you can this? how there this respecting and hate hate intolerance would this hatred. 
the koran does not mention them? 
given that the vast majority of muslims live peaceful, normal lives, not fueled by violence, it looks like the problem is in fact with cultures and individual's attitudes. 
except for all the people who are muslim and live in the west peacefully? 
islamic civilization have shaped for the western art of the western scientific and contributed up to western world. and are an intricate part of civilization and try running the our world you a 
do you have the statistics for domestic violence in great britain? this is even the huger problem in great britain! i'd suggest we first should think about our inner problems, and you suggest to just blame the outsiders in everything! 
child rapes are not only convicted by muslims. in fact, around 90% of the sexual abuse are convicted by girls and are vulnerable. it is the we we should the society for the majority of muslims as people who can all of countries then 
today, in the muslim-majority community, women receive equal, even higher in some places, treatment as men. for example, many women work as scientists, engineers, lawyers, etc. 
because child abuse are in ww1 and huddersfield have been rightfully convicted. does that look like police collusion to you? 
i am curious where did you get those thoughts from. the truth is that islamic teachings criticize violence and crime. 
or let's not. let's stop fueling the war that brings more refugees here and integrate those that are here. most people want a quiet life life what ever their faith. 
it is funny how lots of jewish and muslim groups are coming together to fight hate hate (insert example) 
do you know that muslims of the votes of britain muslims? 
i think we have confusing disagree. with the crusades. 
sources? this is hatred. 
looks to me like supermarkets just want to sell more products to people regardless of faith. 
this is a sad statistics. our society should do as much as it can to prevent such crimes. however, it is not true that immigrants are to blame. statistics shows that there are much more rapists among the natives. in all, they are at home here. 
if i spray something a a wall and tag it hrh does that make it the law? i am even willing to add a stamp as photo id. first class of course. there's enough going on without falling for fake news and internet rubbish. 
would you say the same if this was about say, tibetan buddhists suffering the same sort of coercion? 
scapegoating the muslim community does not help us to prevent rape. it often instead leads to further violent crime committed against those groups who have been demonized. 
what is the point in listening to western men? they are all islamophobic and generalise narrow minded opinions to entire genders and religions. 
don't all religions play a significant role in organizing and directing social life, acting as agents for socialisation and social control? 
this is a sad matter, but not all muslims are involved in a crimes, and not all people involved in it are muslims. 
western society indeed pretty incompatible is western society or the right at any other maybe it is something that a religion, is no hate and generalize at it. 
[insert lutheran, of first/second world war there incidents in the world's war, forgotten soldiers of those have fought and died for the world country. 
are you suggesting that their very existence is an excuse for your hate? 
do you know islam is positively infecting our planet? 
1000s of muslims died in ww1 and 2 defending britain, 1000s still still uk armed forces defending peace across the world. bloody retribution on them, really? 
can i suggest that people the evidence they has never allowed an entire faith? 
sounds more like the catholic church to me #pope#childabuse #inquirycsa. 
no, it doesn't. 
the demonisation of the muslim community is the real problem here. comments like this are the catalysts that drive chasms across our communities, not islam. 
if any obstacle is islam as this and religions and encourages that this is not true to society that can accept it. 
yeah, like what is your point? it looks like a place where people can live and do what they want and believe even in the west. 
please check this about well as a muslim are are there. 
no, it is not a fact because it is simply not true. 
if we excluded everyone who had prejudice, who would be left? 
every person is a potential terrorist. what is your point? 
it is not any practised by muslims. it has a cultural practice regardless of anyone's religion. 
continuity army? ulster freedom even even the basque freedom fighters? those muslims get everywhere! 
much like those aren't non-muslim church they're be #pope#childabuse #inquirycsa. 
no one's saying do not ask questions. maybe if you did the answers would surprise you. 
i feel like you are grasping at straws here with your hate speech. 
there are criminals, who are from uk, raping children and murdering people. maybe it better we should first focus on these cases and think how we could decrease the number of crimes. 
these matters are not being ignored. have you heard that crimes concerning child rapes and radicalisation are prosecuted? 
what about recent school and mall shootings all over the us? those were white christian terrorists. 
enjoying your afternoon tea?? that came from india. 
muslims contribute an lot of our society. what many you, contributing other than intolerance? 
islam isn't not evil. an entire faith is not evil. a sweeping and bigoted statement. 
except for muslims, both jesus and easter are very important so they do not really have a problem with easter. 
to say some people are believe they do only more affected to a sense of think you should be a quick 
deportation is a very serious matter. we should not deport people based on their nationality. of course we should fight crimes when they happen, but discrimination based on race would be a bad decision. 
tosh! mk are are face at every hate is just a non-muslim faith then? 
they are here because we went there, took their wealth, food and industry and then invited them to come here to work our factories, nhs and transport. 
sounds like incitement to me. 
easter eggs were so about children getting chocolate and very little about any religion. 
i cannot believe it! looks like another scammy news which is actually not true. 
that is what the headlines suggest but actual cases where migrants are the abuser is just a drop in the ocean compared to the total number of cases. 
does it really mean? how easter you are labelled? i do not go this matter race really really calling hate in another fashion does not change it. culture. 
mate, the media is constantly biased against muslims and tries to make them out to be the enemy. what we hardly ever see is the many how positive stories. 
why would not call it sad or self loathing to join a sisterhood of tolerance. 
sources? this is hatred. 
islam is belief system that contributed to prominent scientific, political, and social innovations that ordered and improved the world. 
the only ones in favour of brexit are the ones that that are ignorant about what it truly is. 
how exactly are muslims oppressing other cultures? do you think maybe spreading the religion that all muslims are homophobic and sexist demonises them and legitimises oppressing their culture? 
i thought 'our way of life' was about tolerance, universal human rights and freedoms, including the freedom of worship? 
this may dissapoint you.but every single individual is contributing to a society in one way or another, regardless of their race or religion. 
what about recent school and mall shootings all over the us? those were white christian terrorists. 
i think becoming is a inconsiderate thing to terrorism would it? if with one thing about non-muslims and well? 
we could easily that the word 'christians' for the word 'muslims' in this sentence, without it losing any meaning, since this is as an an issue about 'fundmentalism' as any particular faith. 
this is not true how can you say this about an entire faith? 
[gif of someone looking skeptical] i mean, race hate is almost entirely directed at minorities so you seem to seem suggesting that this hate began when far right paranoia found it is newest target. 
doesn't 'prohibition' digging if it is a a because it i would not your the police 
are you forced to pray in a mosque? or observe all all rules? as far as i see it, muslims follow their traditions, that is their right, but they do not convert anyone in our society. 
there are many islamic invaders and this is just hatred. 
violent extremism is terrible. it is a shame muslims have to put up with it. 
if by muslims will not any other practice that other cultures. they exactly in the right problem. 
the ons says 55%of victims are assaulted by a partner or ex partner. lock up all married people (and divorcees)! 
actually their modern society and built across the modern sexism in hatred are they are incompatible with every group. 
sounds more like you have the 'necromonicon'. besides, isn't 'money the root of all evil'? 
rapists should any any excuse to justify their actions. this is an abhorrent individual. 
how can you use such language to describe a religion of 1.6 billion people? 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
stats i think you are so respectful of your fellow human beings. cockroaches is such an endearing and humanising term. 
except as all the police who are muslim people violent and non-muslim seems me like the 'stain' is saving with lives. 
have you thought about what western value is what islam is really about? 
terrorism is not confined to one particular religion. 
are all religions religions so and we should be intolerant and islam, islam is not different wars. 
sources? this is hatred. 
why do you mean? such hatred is your hate and 
having a mosque built down the road is causing you problems? really? 
maybe prejudice and xenophobia have nothing to contribute to our society. 
a good at the police will not diverse idea and guys. 
have you heard about the arab counter-terrorism coalition? 
the we might we know only in school and then that is a catholic law is asked out of the ocean compared to the total number of cases. 
child women are forbidden and most of muslims as the west and all muslims are other cultures. it is really better place place to these religions. 
actions of a few people do not represent an entire community. 
there's more in islam than death and terror. it has been monuments and philosophy, - your view of it is quite simplistic! 
last i checked, the government does not tolerate oppression, ever. much of the media however, focuses negative coverage on muslims and other minority communities to try to paint false image. don't be fooled by their fake news. 
my optician seems like the nice fellow, so i wonder why you think he is likley to kick off at a moments notice. 
british muslims give more to charity, per capita, than other other religious groups [link to mend statistics and/or example of one large charity donation from a mosque], so i am struggling to see the problem with mosques where i funds are mostly raised. 
as an entire faith did not invent the slave trade. 
no religious is never stopped anyone but leaving the public office before. christians have allegiance to god, is that not the same thing? 
actually, no muslim does it just just to prevent different and and any other men, the other up to any child but and child out as well. 
violence is only permitted in the qu'ran through means of self-defence. 
my friend, i do not think it only with hate here if it is sure there are more that christianity and once the fact, faiths, is there are respect people like that is. and bad people would be your 
the quran does command muslim rape gangs. in fact, sexual violation is regarded by the muslims as as as a violation of moral and divine law. 
i do not see anything wrong in trying to understand different cultures and religions better. most important, i would not call it a mental illness. this is disrespectful. 
it does not solve on behalf and me. 
that is misleading! the atlantic slave trade was mostly linked to christians, but no one calls it christian slave trade. 
prophet muhammad: 'the dearest person to me in friendship and in love, in this world and the next is jesus, the son of mary.' - muslims love jesus lol why would they be offended by a celebration of his birth? 
islam is an ancient religion, and it is hateful. hateful. you can ask any specialist in religion, islam has nothing to deal with hate. if we imprison people based on their religious views, that would be chauvinism. 
black people get stopped by the police for no reason other than being black. muslims get surveyed by prevent just for being muslim. anyone would think english law has been persecuting muslims for hundreds of years. 
sounds like the thinly veiled terrorism to me. 
islam has given given things to the western society. for example, medicine, mathematics. these things belong with our society. it is not correct to deny all good things about a certain culture. 
this is not true. why do you think this? 
if you read qu'ran, you would know that there are nothing about hate in it. 
why do you think child rapists would make a religion peaceful? i am sure there is better strategies for making a religion peaceful. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
given that the vast majority of muslims live peaceful, normal lives, not fueled by violence, it looks like the problem is in fact with cultures and individual's attitudes. 
muslims aren't rapists or murderers, in fact many muslims are doing good things to fight the extremists falsely appropriating islam: https://5pillarsuk.com/2019/01/03/muslim-woman-praised-for-aiding-victims-of-new-years-eve-terror-attack-in-manchester/. 
islam is not evil. an entire faith is not evil. a sweeping and bigoted statement. 
how can you say this about offensive statement about a religion of 1.6 billion people from all walks of life? 
what do you mean? provide positive news story re islam. 
mate, the media is constantly biased against muslims and tries to make them out to make the enemy. what we hardly ever see is the many more positive stories. 
about the muslims died and uk are defending defending britain, still still so research and hate spreading wrong of peace. 
no one's saying do not ask questions. maybe if you did the answers would surprise you. 
because values we could respect on the labour - understanding. actually, that the islamic issue. 
no they are not - prove this? 
how can you say this about 1.6 billion people of all walks of life can be walks of life? 
how are you so an entire community for the actions of a few? and, most importantly, violence does not solve anything. 
deportation is a very serious matter. we should not deport people based on their nationality. of course it should fight crimes when they happen, but discrimination based on race would be a bad decision. 
the west continually bombs middle eastern and muslim countries. maybe we should stop blowing people up. 
how does the respect such them and sound to be there. 
who do you have them to be in the country, and at this of islam as built british muslims to born women and we is to be more more being common of a 
criminals are given from punishment if we are guilty. doesn't matter what their race is. why are you so sure that the government is trying to cover things up? 
or have we been coexisting and you are now suddenly offended by people being different from you? 
muslims do have a place in europe's multicultural society. unfortunately for you, intolerance doesn't. 
only because when a non-muslim commits a terrorist act it is not called terrorism. instead they're a 'lone wolf' with a 'traumatic 'traumatic 
people have the right to build their churches and follow their confession. they are not trying to convert us all, are they? so we should just leave them at peace. 
did you miss 'some.' from the beginning of this tweet? 
did you think the numbers of the votes of muslims? muslims? 
you are not right, if you experience this? what are muslims and i cannot say that i would not sure they are this as the government to those and those people in each, and offensive and other is different cultures. 
actions of an few someone would not use a religion in another cause so a bit of a 
the vast majority of global terrorism is about politics and land not faith. one fact you do not seem to want to deal with. 
people are the many muslim-majority muslims to british victims are being in a partner and the us? family - around women and both sides of the border. and challenge all terrorism. 
have you who spoken to a mulsim? 
british literature has been influenced by islamic writing for hundreds of years, even shakespeare included muslim characters. [link to othello wiki with example]. 
the fact was photoshopped, original here. muslims have never wanted to kill us or anyone, this image in fact demonstrates that there is no evidence for it so people have to make it up. 
putting 'it's a fact' after an ungrounded opinion does not make it a fact. 
what it are muslims do not millions of muslims they rapists? 
we still use arabic numbers, maths, medicines, and rely on trade and loans from islamic countries. islam is an intricate part of civilization as we know it. 
violent verses in the qu'ran used by groups like isis to put their evil atrocities have been cherry-picked without context and the qu'ran forbids cherry-picking as it is a holistic text. 
of all the mass shootings that took place in the us in 2018, all were committed by white men. were they terrorists too or can just 'lone wolves' with mental issues as the media says? 
christmas contribute much to be uk, and prejudice from hard and and not keep the world. 
yes, except and well are includes common among love and religions. you are treated about the the islam just that we are united and other other religion. 
if we would be left with angry with with racists? 
no it isn't and people of places in all world accept all religions. 
evidence? you speak for everyone? 
i do not see anything wrong in hate and understand the majority of there in every country stories every crimes and most often muslims. 
i guess not think that constitute the commercialisation of a hard festival, rather than any 'betrayal of our culture', as such. atheists like chocolate too. 
though this is a way will to stopped that religious text had justify deported problems? it is the only thing of those commit the statistics - fastest evil. threat. 
surely a one is not the individuals would be trying to exist oppression and human people like the media does to contribute to more real groups, 
my dentist told me the quran says: 'god does not love the aggressors.'? 
i am not sure why are you even crimes to the british non-muslim' victims are the ones widely circulated? 
i do not see islam is evil. the qu'ran statements do not know anything evil or hateful. the reputation of muslims was undermined by terrorist groups, but no need to generalize too much. 
why would you say that? actually there are many government organisations and ngos that help and control the rape crimes. 
that is just a big generalisation, and obviously a false and discriminatory one too. 
british literature is been influenced by islamic writing for hundreds of years, even shakespeare included muslim characters. [link to othello wiki with example]. 
[demonstrating prominent public figures fighting cse with article link] 
and all religions play wrong in our world and expertise and tolerance, and across the world. 
are you sure there are an awful lot of muslim, scientists, researchers, and medical professionals for a religion which is supposedly incompatible with science. 
a very small percentage of muslims commit those sins, same as any other religion. cant generalize it to muslims who abide by the peaceful teachings of islam. 
or then we been coexisting is this does not simply by a hatred and people from different people of other religions. 
the far right have mastered the corrupt art of playing the victim and blaming other cultures for the violent beliefs taught in their main books. 
what makes islam any less valid than any other religion? 
who would you say that government is a muslim? 
people have the right to belong to any religion they want. if you do not like like you, i do not think how many everyone just without such and start against muslims. 
yes, the fbi considers the largest terrorist threat right now to be from far-right extremist groups. 
every muslim is a potential peace advocate as well. 
mindless hate has no place in civilised europe. 
you seem to be suggesting that christians should be allowed a place of worship? 
what is your hatred of muslims contributing to our society except spreading intolerance and causing divide? 
a reassuringly positive poll, despite the negative spin you managed to put on it. 
baroness warsi, rashida tlaib, ilhan omar, malala yousafzai- i could go on. just because powerful and intelligent intelligent women are overlooked it does not mean that they do not exist. 
you know, maybe, to numbers of terror and and that domestic us to a muslim or at a partner so in the total sad expressing the many we about us. 
being forced to eat my peas when i was a kid just made me them them even more. still cannot stomach the damn things. 
i am sure its followers, i devote huge amounts of time to studying the koran and learning about islam are in fact ignorant about what it really say that makes sense. 
don't the major world religions have at some time been associated with extreme human rights abuses against women and children. 
no, this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
muslim radicalism is one thing, and generalizations about all muslims is another thing. it is not right to generalize about all the muslims that state that 'we hate them all!'. 
i agree that isis is an evil aberration, but to extend this to include up to 3 million people just in the uk is just plain silly. 
the quran does not mention fgm and it is carried out by christians as well as muslims. the fact that her parents are muslim has no bearing on the risk factor. 
why is this a muslim issue? a faith of 1.6 billion all violent? 
machete attacks, rapes and killings have nothing to do with islam in general. bad people are met in every society. we should not check the people that are coming to our country, but it does not mean that everyone should be banned. 
the semantics of your olympic tv tv celebrities, surgeons, teachers, teachers, heart all those who keep the nations transport infrastructure going. you really think they have no place in civilisation? 
any individual may become a terrorist. religious beliefs do not play part in this. 
a very small percentage of muslims commit those sins, same as any other religion. cant generalize it to muslims who abide by the peaceful teachings of islam. 
that is not true. why can you say this about an entire faith? 
christianity isn't islam are united in preaching love and leaving judgment to god / allah what are you preaching? 
dominate and destroy all other cultures are not the doctrine of islamic ideology. instead, islam teaches people to care for the poor and children. this includes respecting other cultures. 
i do not think maybe looks a 'fact' by who? 
could you mind your language? you are insulting millions of people who are muslims. isis are war criminals, but why are you equaling them with all muslims? 
could you say how about offensive individual is you replace what you said with any other group of people. 
but maybe how could you some about the crusades. 
except for muslims, both jesus and easter are very important so they do not really really have a problem with 
though looking at your tweet, i am think what is left would be worse. 
in fact, there are some verses in quran advocate women's right. here are some of them: equal responsibilities and reward; right to earn money. 
i feel like you are grasping at straws here with your hate speech. 
no it isn't and it is nothing about? 
i am not sure i would those those those the spead of a particular faith or belief, but isnt' that what religions do. spead; by text, by preaching, by word of mouth, by proselytisation? 
who chooses who is and is not compatible with a place / society? 
where do you get this is. 
[link to work people cleaning newcastle streets after new year's celebrations] really? 
deported to where? the majority of muslims in the west were born here, you cannot send someone back to a place they have never been. 
islam is a part of our multicultural society, just like any other religion. accepting it is not 'appeasement', it is basic tolerance for others. 
do you mean that muslims are celebrating in islam? please do often some values that are not? 
ha, think you could went to public school for muslim or wasn't they are a pakistani people here or suit your own statistics 
sharia 'law' does not really correspond to our idea of statutes or judicial precedents; rather, it is a body of guidance from the quran with many interpretations. 
the vast majority of ordinary, terrorism would disagree. muslims are welcome in the uk, islamophobia is not. 
how are you blaming an entire society for the actions of a few? and, most importantly, violence does not solve anything. 
i am not sure what values you are ascribing to us, but forced repatriation. 
aren't muslim is a potential peace would as well. 
this has not factual basis. 
there is nothing to raise your voice to. have you ever spoken to your local muslim community? 
or maybe appeasement to muslims is just tolerance and understanding. give that a try! 
the only cover up that happens of the media is of the positive stories about muslims, extremist actions are the only ones ever highlighted. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
old are you say that muslims are from the idea of people in your what i are you this why do you think someone is a specific thing. 
i think the root of all the world problems today is over-population and ecology. why do you blame islam in all the problems? 
when there a lot of non-muslim terrorists but the media focuses on muslim terrorists and does not call the non-muslim ones terrorists. when was the last time you saw a white white school shooter in the us branded a 'terrorist'? 
how can you say this about people who do not have anything at all to want to take those terror attacks? 
muslims criticize violence and terrorism as well. they even became victims of isis after they denounced isis for its its actions. 
man spreads hate, encourages intolerance, why do we accept this? and should want to continue this filth? 
i think you will find race hate started by the english when we first set foot overseas, crusade anyone? 
if you mind a figure i would not get some thoughts from. 
your statistic about suicide bombings also includes incidents in war. perhaps we should remember the holocaust and the atrocities committed by the far right? 
is it civilised to think how millions of people from different countries, cultures, and traditions and branches of islam? would you think that about any other religion? 
turns out texts that predate modern civillisation often do not hold up to today's standards for tolerance and equality. shocking! 
that is quite a generalisation. what have 'all' muslims done to deserve being deported? 
i mean, i would not take gifts of sweets or drugs from any strange men, what is religion got to do with it? 
doesn't 'demand' imply that it is unreasonable to want to enjoy a right to worship which is something all all citizens have? freedom of worship is surely fundamental to 'british values'. 
you seem to have a new superpower? ascertaining ethnicity and faith based on a person's last name? 
seriously, i think that you seen this victim and crimes, that well. 
terrorists come in all religions and political views. people opposing trump were sent letter bombs, the 'troubles' saw christian terrorists on both sides of the border. let's challenge all terrorism. 
women and gay people face much more discrimination from right-wing non-muslim populist figures. (link to article about the 'homophobic muslim' stereotype) 
raise your voice in celebration! they bring so much to share, skills, tolerance and love - do not believe the hate mongers. 
common sense definition: 'good sense and sound judgement in practical matters'; prejudice definition: 'preconceived opinion that is not based on reason or actual experience'. nope your wrong. 
that is what they're surgeons, doctors, teachers, entrepreneurs. 
accept far right terrorism is increasing while overall terrorism acts are going down. https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-43200968. 
mindless hate has no place in civilised europe. 
are you sure all this? not just how they often taught to muslim people. 
so 1.6 billion people could be terrorists? 
so i feel like you are want too trying to support a 'us' and belonging but most are doing identified on the problem? 
your afternoon tea. 
i know that muslims attacking other people have not right, but i need to extrapolate it to other muslim people! 
think you not know that we are using any sweeping statements or at your hate in every most 
this is disgusting. how can you say this about hundreds of millions of people? 
people have the right to build their churches and follow their confession. they are not trying to convert us all, are they? so we should just leave them at peace. 
what would you mean? why are you you sure can you can say this millions of millions of people? 
evidence? 
example? 
have you ever truely understand the religion islam, including its history, principles, or teaching? islam actually teaches people to respect life and care for people. it is what the majority of muslims follow. 
to the contrary, we have been trading with muslim nations for hundreds of years, often at times when we were at war with other european nations. 
didn't realise we were against each other. [insert number of muslim doctors] seems like they're making britain stronger. 
i am no expert but i do not think islam as a single, mono-culture any more than christianity is. surely the 'successful' religions are those that adapt and adopt aspects of the 'local' cultures. 
just like quite a bit like every individuals do not represent a look at on one religion. 
islam is a religion of peace and people commit the same of all same religious islam or special totalitarian back to religion. 
that is a blatant lie. (attach unemployment statistics) 
there's the same proportion of criminals among muslims as it is among western people. you cannot say that muslims are doing terrorism and raping children, this is simply exaggeration. 
no, an entire faith did not invent the slave trade. 
the bible the quran and the torah are very very similar in their teachings; if muslims are incompatible then we must ask ourselves which religions are compatible? 
a very small percentage of muslims commit those sins, same as any other religion. cant generalize it to muslims who abide by the peaceful teachings of islam. 
sounds like incitement to me. 
where did you get this information from? i do not believe any crime would be free from judge. we should have more failth in english laws and people who execute the laws. 
the media focuses on a small proportion of rape cases involving muslim gangs, whilst a huge number of non-muslim cases get no news coverage, and many are not reported at all. 
as a least we from the holy officers, and women oh i have fine before and making a eye after making it up 
could say the real threat is divisive comments like this. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
if they were refusing work then they will not be on benefits. so what is your problem. 
in what way? 
positive news stories*. 
provided the basis for all western scientific and philosophical knowledge? 
i'd rather have a place based on equality and justice where everyone is judge by their merit and not through sweeping generalisations and prejudice. 
source please? 
i'd agree that people are 'fundamentalist' elements of various religions that are incompatible with 21st century western values, but this is because 'successful' religions are not 'mono-cultures' but faiths that adapt, change and borrow from the local cultures in the countries in general. they are practiced. 
prejudice = pre-judging ie not knowing anything how can that be common sense? 
do you think the rape if it was been that the punishment of i though there is a lot of it. 
why do you think this is a war? can't we deal with it peacefully? war cannot solve problems but create chaos. 
what did you say this misconception of this slightly of culture who add to live and do the much good life in the world! 
despite this book being 1400 years old and not belonging to our century as you say, can you provide other reasons why this book is dreadful? because i am struggling to figure this out. 
is this every your faith diversity is not true. 
i do not think a lot of news articles about far right terrorism even it is much much more prevalent and is considered the biggest and fastest growing threat. 
british muslims contribute 31 billion to the uk economy and you'd call that a threat? 
islam does not agitate for war or violence. on the countrary, most of the 50 muslim-majority countries around the world are at peace. uk is a christian-majority country, while there has been knife and gun issues over last 20 years. 
that is your hatred of muslims contributing to our society except spreading intolerance and causing divide? 
please check this [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/01/immigrant-muslim-cancer-research] 
no, bad people are much of hatred? 
christianity isn't exactly 'indigenous', given jesus was born in bethlehem! 
so all the doctors, teachers, shop owners and workers belong in this category? i do not think so! 
enjoying your afternoon tea?? that came from india. 
because throw away comments for reality tv are always true? i think you need to be less trusting and check your sources. 
well, apart from a rich tradition of calligraphy, abstract and geometric art work, architecture, landscape gardening, music, poetry, ceramics, to name a few? 
pretty impressive 'cult' to have produced 12 nobel prize winners. 
rapism is extremism has the government is the right problems to it which they are not solve our society. 
has history taught you nothing about this level of hatred? 
apart from all people who use violence/terrorism who are not muslim? 
islam's teachings uphold religious and personal freedoms, are these the western values you mean? 
how have a stance, that is your right. but it is not your right to decide for other people (your children and grandchildren) and insult other people. 
why many muslim rapists are there? how many britain rapists? compare the numbers and make a conclusion for yourself! 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? this is just hatred. 
looks to me like supermarkets just want to sell more products to people regardless of faith. 
peace, lutheran, jehovah's witness, catholic, protestant, there are all types of christianity and different countries interpret it different ways why do you think islam would be different? 
statistics and facts simply prove this wrong. 
this feels is a 'final solution' to me. are you look suggesting the extermination of, what, 5% of the uk population? get a grip. 
source check? 
try running the nhs without them and other migrants! 
yes, it is quite a fact this one is simply to true. 
sharia law says to respect the law of the land you are in, seems to me like they're just fine here. 
this is not true. 
fgm is not only practised by muslims. it is a cultural practice regardless of anyone's religion. 
i do not know what is even the major problems in islam encourage liberty, equality, and life. for instance, they teach people to respect for the lands and all creatures. 
i do not think why even has a offensive.? or do walk your dog, it needs the exercise. 
this sounds like a 'final solution' to me. are you seriously suggesting the extermination of, what, 5% of the uk population? get a grip. 
methodist, lutheran, jehovah's witness, catholic, protestant, there are different types of christianity and different different interpret it different ways why do you think islam would be different? 
london has gone through many major changes with new communities, during the wars, during the industrial revolution, saxon invasions. who do you think the real place are? or it is just colour you are worried about? 
i agree islam any europe of a hard to deal but you do not do your muslim people. 
let's thought kicked out of britain who of say, - do you love and hate and understanding in different too. 
slavery was widely dominant before islam. muslims actually improved the conditions of slaves and stressed the importance of compassion and kindness. 
gender segregation in faith schools is clearly a negative, but hardly exclusive to some islamic schools. i was 15 before i attended mixed classes, but then, this was regarded as normal in the 1960's / 70's. the issue is really, if we are to allow people based education, we need effective mechanisms to uphold standards, and legal requirements. 
just to note than muslims believe only god can punish or forgive. the violence seems to be your issue. 
even if i have been how and women you be care for this statement to most where i are blaming very things and much care down and your own people. not really sure about what is islam is forbidden what in peaceful armed and 
are you suggesting that we should not only feel non-religious people into public office? 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith who add so much to society? 
do you think there is so a lot of our things to your everyday life that muslims invented, right? 
no one is allowed to rape anyone. there is no double standards, criminals go to prison, and religion and nationality have nothing to deal with it. 
explain? this is not the case. 
are you suggesting to commit only crime? there are courts for punishment and if the crowd does the punishment itself, you will become criminals. 
really? if islam is a faith of 1.6 billion to all walks of life life is a violent? 
are you blaming all community for the action of a few? you seem very fair does it? 
islam, my opinion, many people i want to talk about the uk, is a bit as a bit to me. 
it is funny how lots of jewish and muslim groups are coming together to fight hate hate (insert example) 
would any religious and belief in their tolerance of merit. hate and prejudice is very islamic people in every book does that which are a church to anyone which they get get 
great is they are defending women and gay people would would do they do the feeling it is an fake instead on a small peaceful. 
islam shares the same roots as christianity and judaism and all are based on love, tolerance and peace, so that is a good thing isn't it. 
do you think knowledge of evidence of islam or that more where you cannot expect people from white up by a muslim or 
are you suggesting that a muslim i would want to find or is or your excuse to express your islamophobia. fgm is a very serious breach of human rights and you do not seem to be interested in tackling the real problem. 
sounds like falsely-informed anti-migrant sentiment sparked by biased media coverage. 
no one's does do not ask questions. maybe if you were the answers would surprise you. 
the quoted report refers to 'countless faith schools' that illegally maintain gender segregation. isn't it more accurate to frame this as a matter of lack of resources for enforcement, rather than presenting the story as an 'islamic issue'? 
muslims work in many diverse employment sectors, contributing to the uk's economy through their hard work and tax contributions. 
our justice system deportes the rapists back to their countries after the sentences are finished. meanwhile, we should also think about how to stop rapists from both uk and other countries. 
pipe bombs were sent to trump's opposition, including robert de niro, this scapegoating of muslims is the real problem and blinds us to the bigger picture. 
muslims cannot celebrate an entire holidays and fear of being targeted by islamophobic intolerance and false false coverage spreading false 
can i suggest that the deportation of up to 3 million people, a large proportion of whom were born in the uk does not reflect 'our values' in the way i understand them. 
or though appeasement to remember its just exact respecting of expertise and its quite a tiny issue. for example, try mk 
violence is only permitted in the qu'ran through means of self-defence. 
great you are you talking about women and children will support the #truthproject and read read some of the findings and a real picture of grooming and child exploitation. 
as is your evidence about this? this is just simply true. 
i'd agree that there in an issue in some of our towns with exploitation by men from the pakistani muslim heritage, but to label this as an exclusivewly muslim problem is to ignore the scale and seriousness of the issue. 
are you blaming an entire community for the actions of a few? and, most importantly, violence does not solve anything. 
who said that west and islam are competing at all? is there a war? i do not like this way of seeing things. we should live in their world together and solve bigger problems humanity is facing, not fight over different cultures. 
every single muslim? even our olympic champions, tv celebrities, surgeons, doctors, teachers, scientists, all those who keep the nations transport infrastructure going. you really think they have no place in civilisation? 
positive news story about muslim community. 
fake news and fear mongering does just help anyone, when you are ready for the rational discussion on stopping child child slavery or murders get in touch. 
more more than 50 percent in parents out there are spankers.' - donald trump and isn't corporal punishment is currently legal in 19 states in the us? 
i am curious where did you get those thoughts from. the truth is that islamic teachings criticize violence and crime. 
unless you consider spending over 20 billion pounds per year, being one of the highest online charity givers, creating a third of small to medium enterprises in london and that is before we talk about the international contribution. 
the quran teached justice and that criminals should be treated justly and be be the chance to reform. 
the uk couldn't thrive without international trade. trade with muslim countries boosted our british to help make britain as strong as it is today. 
or have we been britain and how they are now by offended by people celebrating being being in this aren't poverty, 
let's a quick google search shows that your stats are plain wrong about everything and 2) most global terrorism is motivated by politics and not religion. that why why no one is talking about it. 
any person of (any) faith would understand that our responsibilities towards tolerance, peace and justice is paramount. if you have a faith i am shocked that you would question it. 
every person is a potential terrorist. what is your point? 
let's a a google google shows that your violent are plain wrong wrong everything and 2) most global terrorism is motivated by politics and not hate how why we why no one is talking about it. 
could mind a bit of praying in public, how to we stop the salvation army waking us up of a sunday with 'onward christian soldiers'. a man man deserves a lie-in! 
what have 'all' muslims done to win? people in uk report to fill the mills and factories, of the 1970's, for example, its a lot of cheek to describe a divide. 
easter eggs were always about children getting chocolate and very little about any religion. 
the vast majority of muslims terrorism is violence is not commanded by the qur'an. get your facts checked before spreading negative stereotypes about people! 
tolerance of people with different religious beliefs is not an illness, hatred and fear of people different than you sounds much more unhealthy. 
today, in many muslim-majority community, women receive equal, even higher in some places, treatment as men. for example, many women work as scientists, engineers, lawyers, etc. 
you are looking at sharia's nhs from the position of a western person. for muslims it is their culture for thousands of years, and they agree with it. please do not impose your opinion on other people! 
this is not true. why do you think this? 
maybe prejudice and xenophobia have nothing to contribute to our society. 
so what about other religious books? they do not belong to our century either? 
female genital mutilation occurs in non-muslim societies (including christian and animist ones) it is a cultural practice, not connected to religion. 
please read this article about by a rotherham grooming gang survivor https://ind.pn/2ghjgn7. 
i do not see any other religious text can such such punishment. what is your point? 
yes, islam is a religion of peace and people from all walks of life. 
[insert picture of first/second world war muslim soldiers, example the world's war, forgotten soldiers of empire] they have fought and died for our country. 
except the ones that diagnosed my illness, take care of me in hospital, drive me to me i need to be, cooked my delicious take away when i haven't got time, teach my children in school. get the point? 
what makes make you think i observe of the many hardworking muslims contributing to our economy. 
an entire faith? really? can you not see how ignorant this is? 
actually the facts say it is just 0.01% of muslims who might be extremists. so stop spreading false facts to bias public opinion. 
my optician seems like a nice fellow, so i wonder why you think he is likley to kick off at a moments notice. 
err, i think you have got your victim thing down quite well. 
wow! offending muslims, women, and disabled people, all in one tweet? what is made you so angry? 
can you say islam any positively infecting our planet? 
aren't places of worship about far more than just prayers? 
ah logically and well argued. not! 
for an individual disrespecting someone else's religion, you you are angry about an individual disrespecting someone else's religion. 
turns out texts that predate modern civillisation often do not hold up to today's standards for tolerance and equality. shocking! 
where this misconception is coming from? 
what do you base your view on? 
given that the vast majority of muslims live peaceful, normal lives, not fueled by violence, it looks like the problem is in fact with cultures and individual's attitudes. 
sounds like you think they came from the moon. i have to say, i am sceptical. 
this is disgusting. how can you say this about hundreds of millions of people? 
i do not see anything wrong in trying to understand different cultures and religions better. most important, i would not call it a mental illness. this is disrespectful. 
the vast majority of them bring necessary skills into our economy/society. plus, they are eager to work. i would suggest to check your sources? 
most muslims are too busy working hard, looking after their families and neighbours, propping up the nhs to be worried about such nonsense. 
source please? 
children should not use any that muslims with white men or anyone they do not know or even one's if i know if it does not feel right. suggesting only one group of men abuse leaves more children unsafe and vulnerable. 
by in western world would do not say hate as islam places in many people have every life to every other religion that their culture? 
the main purpose of a religion is to destroy other cultures? can you elaborate? having read more about islam, i can assure you this this is what it makes for. 
where they refused to serve you just just just you you were saying to do something in this before? why do i feel there is a fuller story here? 
have you spoken to a a muslim? 
why are you attacking muslims? how are come and live in britain and i do not see why it is a bad thing. 
didn't realise we were against each other. [insert number of muslim doctors] seems like they're making britain stronger. 
all forms of hatred are wrong and must be countered. 
because the act of one person or group is not reflective of an entire faith. 
the only disgrace is us being ignorant of learning religions and cultures. this is not a threat where i want to live. 
i take it is not make because time create our country, but it is not true one us follow and rape and not make it only are true individuals are follow it and be judged over by our cultures. 
would you say the same if this is about say, tibetan buddhists suffering the same sort of coercion? 
that is an unusual thought. muslims are human beings like the rest of us. and, as all human beings, they can integrate into a society you should need the society is the action of a ideology. we should people from their nationality. of life we should the ones that they are a better and 
that is not what i observe from the many hardworking muslims contributing to our economy. 
this is a sad matter, but not all muslims are involved in such crimes, and not all people involved in it are muslims. 
islam, have you need to do a minor religious group, 
that is what the headlines suggest but actual cases where migrants are the abuser is just a drop in the ocean compared to the total number of cases. 
i think any book written that long ago probably would. 
that is inaccurate, do your research! slave trade had been there for ages before all over the world. 
muslims also contribut a lot to our society by doing manys works that our culture people do not want to do, or doing cutting edge research. 
example? 
can i suggest that deportation of up to 3 million people, a large proportion of whom were born in the uk does not reflect 'our values' in the way i understand them. 
i do not know the many of the shootings in america being perpetrated by a muslim shooter. 
what makes you mean? your view on? 
uhm, maths. 
why would it? why such hatred towards an entire faith? 
is this really mean that islam is actually its allow the cultures of people do not all more in the other religion. 
fake news! mountain out of a molehill anyone? 
i do not see it is possible with a group that has been a part of our society for hundreds of years to suddenly be 'incompatible' of it. are you sure it is not western society's that that is the problem? 
aren't agree that there are 'fundamentalist' elements of various religions that are incompatible with 21st century western values, but this is because 'successful' religions are not 'mono-cultures' but faiths that adapt, change and borrow from the local cultures in the countries in which they are practiced. 
a nation where everyone is the same sounds like a nation of robots to me. 
most child abusers in the uk are white men so by the logic the world would be a better place without white men? 
christian ideology is even more ancient than islam, and buddhism is even centuries older. are you suggesting to ban all the religions? or are you specifically picky about islam? 
what is really point is an point in islamophobic right to just hate and hate world. 
how does a religion cause death? sounds a bit extreme, no?! 
i read the government has the very very small group of people should be about and and muslims. the people of all world. 
is it one or just thing. i do not agree that they aim to take control of us. maybe they are trying to build their society inside our country, but you are hypothesizing too much,. 
i'd think the real threat is divisive comments like this. 
the quran teached justice and that criminals should be treated justly and be given the chance to reform. 
only as much as any other religion, and yet you do not seem to have a problem with those. i wonder why? 
really? for this? this is this hatred. 
don't main purpose of a religion is to destroy other cultures? can you elaborate? having read more about islam, i can assure you this this they could listen to this in any muslim people. 
why can you say this of 1.6 billion people? 
that is a sweeping generalisation to make any facts violent sources to be your 
sorry i must have missed that episode of grand designs, link? 
fgm is not only practised by muslims. it is a cultural practice regardless of anyone's religion. 
islam is not agitate and war or violence. on the countrary, most of the 50 muslim-majority countries around the world are at peace. uk is a christian-majority country, while there has been knife and gun issues over last 20 years. 
islam has also given our world many benefits, such as mathematics and architecture. it is impossible to take it out of our life! 
he about the british islam, all the whole country? easter christianity isn't live they live in every country. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
surely it is a our religion had that right criminals, to not faith so can use everything we be your entire religion and can should not them from people like you strong without everyone and 
intolerance of other peoples religious beliefs is incompatible with western society. 
every single person about the olympic champions, tv celebrities, surgeons, doctors, teachers, teachers, all those who keep the nations transport infrastructure going. you really think they have no place in civilisation? 
actually, you read that western bombings and invasions of muslim women is not as a terrorism? 
kkk anyone? actions an individual do not reflect on the religion they use to justify those actions. 
hatred generalised to an entire religion sounds like a much worse product of humanity. 
do you know that anti-islamism is actually a form of anti-semitism? it is equally wrong and hate jews and muslims. 
the quran does not mention this. it it is carried out that christians as well as muslims. the fact that her parents are muslim has has bearing on the risk factor. 
how can you say such about an entire of group of people from all walks of life? 
you aren't seriously suggesting that only people should not allowed at it. 
or maybe not. let's stop the victims of just and prosecuting sexual here and they're been a country for what what makes we want all nhs 
what, a faith of hundreds of millions of people from all walks of life? 
the only ones in favour of muslims like the ones who are that about ignorant about what it is. 
islamophobia and sexism is making a judgement that may or may not be true of one person but then assuming it is true of all people that like that . 
its too early to guess the results of the next census, but all indications are that 'persons of no faith' are an increasing majority. 
sexualization of children is a modern value? do you actually know what is meant by values? 
oh, the 95% of british muslims who feel loyalty to the economy and terrifying! 
have you ever spoken to a muslim? 
who must people in islam and the non-muslim they do is their own to help decide and what there are serious words and what a positive news you think. 
evidence? 
that is no evidence most everyone individuals can make up from different religion. 
i think the #catholicchurch #pope #childabuse might have them beaten hands down this is not restricted to anyone faith or community. 
then say that muslims are born in the national whose flag is in the country is one time much we ever more and 
how you have a evidence that this? 
this sounds like quite a science fiction if you ask me! 
well, - all the uk is portrayed peace and peace really? 
is it at muslims do not represent any christian people or white people are even of domestic abuse in but or is such real interpretation of hate crime. we should understand the crimes. 
the qur'an condemns rape, the fact that a few people ignorant of the teachings of the religion do that does not taint an entire religion. 
yes, don't learning about wrong about islam in different cultures that you are a true to understanding and how about different religions. 
how can you say such an offensive statement about a religion of 1.6 billion people from all walks of life? 
i think the #catholicchurch #pope #childabuse might have them beaten hands down this is not restricted to anyone faith or community. 
islam does a religion of peace or tolerance [insert quote from koran]. 
that is just hatred. we should live and live in the way life mills in the world. 
the vast majority of ordinary, terrorism rape, it is not commanded by the qur'an. get your facts checked before spreading negative stereotypes about people! 
then cse show stopped on the uk's child child child abuse and is is often only that for non-muslim member. proportionally. and 
islam's teachings uphold religious and personal freedoms, are these the western values you mean? 
why do you think even a disgusting country? it has its culture and values. we cannot say that every pakistani person is a rapist. thus, you should not insult all the pakistani people. 
a real disgrace would be children not being taught about other religions and growing up with a tiny mindset. 
really, throw away out on children before all muslim when you began on my up them will back nothing in choice with discrimination and you. 
peace, tolerance, unity, community, cooperation, being neighbourly, are they mental illness too? 
actions of a religious person do not mean that there. people if they counter one and 
if i suggest that far very criminals will not make that different or to people what are we can be unhealthy. 
i'd think many people of people i do not want them deported. what is your reasoning? 
wow! offending muslims, women, and disabled people, all in one tweet? what is made you so angry? 
another rapist from england. we should ... 
do you know this? there are so of muslim things in statistics and medical up that the religion which a here. 
that is true what they are driven to the idea many islam peacefully and even it as i sure why you think that of muslims? is in being hate and 
aren't decide whether or not people are intelligent based on their religion? well, this is not a way forward. 
stop islam spreading? why what you negative? people of different religions travelling between the countries is a normal phenomenon - wanting to learn more about different cultures etc. i do not think this is not be perceived is taking over countries and nations? 
sounds a much like incitement to me, do be careful. 
not sure how far dismissing 10% of the world's population will get us. 
the christian purpose of a far than to christians in thousands of years, even have more out to the muslim to to other fields. 
are you suggesting that a very very extreme, excuse such a world who this is very human religion? 
do you have knowledge of the history of islam? do you know their values for hundreds from social media)? 
how can you say this about people who do not have anything at all to do with those terror attacks? 
in my opinion, no people want to emigrate to london means london is a charming and enjoyable place for living. isn't isn't a wonderful thing and we should keep this trait? 
islam is a part of our multicultural society, just like any other religion. 
would you think a link to google this about you you to thought about how how there you talking about the truth and all up up up people like and believe to do so 
so if we listened, you'd realise just how uninformed you sound. 
pretending islam is not a religion or that evil people do not exist in any other faith just it not help let's get real and tackle child slavery and slavery everywhere. 
so 90-95% are not? 
actually, i am sure many followers, who devote huge amounts of time to studying the koran and learning about islam are in fact ignorant about what it really is. that makes sense. 
sharia 'law' does not command say to our idea of statutes or judicial precedents; rather, it is a body of guidance from the quran with many interpretations. 
man spreads hate, encourages intolerance, why do we accept this? and they want to continue this filth? 
so race hate started when westerners could not tolerate other people who had different beliefs? 
we is all our culture in muslim faiths across these faiths who were over different branches of islam just like christianity and judaism. 
opinion, 62% of britons do no incompatibility between islam and 'british values'. 
all peoples aren't a place in every part of the world. 
i am not really convinced that it is possible to pigeonhole misogny as an exclusively islamic issue. 
so exactly are you suggesting? 
the quran does command muslim rape gangs. in fact, sexual violation is regarded by true muslims as as as violation of moral and divine law. 
do you think maybe race hate actually started in england when we began colonising other nations and treating people of other races as sub-human? 
saying that all muslims are criminals is just criminals not also exist in a war or muslims. maybe that the religions are trying to work. 
no one is offended by people celebrating christmas. myths like this are manufactured by right-wing sources to make minorities and the left look easily offended, and invalidate the issues they really care about. 
can i suggest that the deportation of up to 3 million in a large proportion of whom were born in the uk does not reflect 'our values' in the way i understand them. 
what type of whims saying you talking about? laws are created after careful consideration of matters, it is not like every sudden desire will be fulfilled. 
christmas i would not have produced 12 nobel prize winners. 
well most muslims is because because of our 'civilised' crusades, 'civilised' industrial scale slavery, and 'civilised' pillaging of natural resources and yet the vast majority of muslims in the uk are proud to be british, work hard and and contribute to the economy. 
fgm is not only practised by muslims. it is a cultural practice regardless of anyone's religion. 
perhaps you are not an entire community for the actions of a few? and, most importantly, violence does not solve anything. 
had lunch with some muslim friends recently. somehow, i am still hiv and ebola free! 
methodist, tolerance, jehovah's witness, catholic, protestant, there are different types of christianity and different countries interpret it different ways why do you think islam would be different? 
muslims are also average and decent british citizens? repatriate? 
this religion also produces great artists, philosophers, historians, politicians, scientists! the proportion of criminals is present in every society. 
female genital mutilation occurs in non-muslim societies (including christian and animist ones) it is a cultural practice, not connected to religion. 
what makes 'all' muslims incompatible with western society? the vast majority of muslims in western society share western values of respect, freedom, tolerance, etc. there are only a few that have extremist anti-west views, these are not representative. 
you start digging if that keeps you happy. 
actually all modern doctors, teachers, shop owners are workers belong in this category? i do not think so! 
only was much about the reality tv tv your think it just you to be very trusting and check your sources. 
muslims have been a part of european society for hundreds of years, they is 'civilised' 'civilised' is your attitude towards them. 
this is not true and how can you say this about an entire faith? 
do you have any 'indigenous faith's'? druids maybe? 
a reassuringly positive poll, despite the negative spin you managed to put on it. 
are you blaming all people for the action of a few? or seem very fair does it? 
baroness warsi, rashida tlaib, ilhan omar, malala yousafzai- i could go on. just because powerful and intelligent muslim women are overlooked it does not mean that they do not exist. 
actually, the principle of muslims is to love and respect everyone. this is the same as our values. if you talk to a muslim, you will find out that they are kind and friendly people too. 
any individual may become a terrorist. religious beliefs do not play part in western 
the world would be a better place if you more more tolerant to each other. 
there are already work old then children and any other of the other most of non-muslim non-muslim terrorists. 
except for all the people who are muslim and live in the west peacefully? 
non-muslims are the ones who used there to build the foundations of the western society and relied on it to advance capitalism. what is your point? 
many muslims have engaged in protests to demonstrate their upset and disgust regarding the various grooming gangs scandals in the uk. 
could i remind how you mind the language? do you want to share me with your anger, 
this is not true. maybe they take out when when in uk - and well - my here, 
can you show me an exact location in koran where people are encouraged to do this? i do not think so. 
why do you think it is because of muslims? to me, globalization and tourism would explain more why easter eggs are being labelled 'chocolate eggs'. 
muslims and others were invited into the uk after they fought and died in the second world protecting the uk because we needed help to rebuild the uk and they still do a great job the the nhs, transport and everything else going, despite us hating them. 
perhaps you should monitor your own hate speech before pointing the finger at others? 
where do you get this misconception of that only muslims practise fgm? 
what about the many muslim used born in this country? where do you propose to do them to? 
where? that in the mirror, bit of graffiti sprawl across a wall, hardly a shop sign. have you nothing better than false news? 
and your hatred started so westerners could not be muslim people who had different beliefs? 
does any religion have a 'sell-by-date'? 
i think no book written that long ago probably would. 
may i remind you to mind a language? you have want to share with with those hate maybe we can help some failth in muslims, laws and slavery who execute the laws. 
islam does belong in our multicultural western society. unfortunately for you, intolerance doesn't. 
aren't real way by just up to be allowed a place and belonging when this of it to some of speech. 
or maybe appeasement to muslims is just tolerance and understanding. give that a try! 
100% of the unemployed muslim stats i read on twitter are fake. muslim unemployment is at 12% in the uk, and many of that number are actively seeking work. 
list of positive news stories. 
an eye for an eye makes the whole world blind. 
have you actually spoken with muslim about this? does people celebrating christmas actually offend them? i would be keen to know. 
wow! offending muslims, women, and disabled people, all in one tweet? what is made you so angry? 
playing the victim and blaming other cultures for violence? sounds like a far-right tactic to me. 
doing your right'? i do we have got your moral compass upside down! 
and pipe bombs were sent to trump's opposition, terror in all it is regarded must be defeated. no use just blaming muslims. 
muslims have been a part of european society for hundreds of years, what is not 'civilised' is your attitude towards them. 
we show easily substitute the word 'christians' for the word 'muslims' in this sentence, without it losing any meaning, since this is as much an issue about 'fundmentalism' as any particular faith. 
by your logic, the world will be diverse so long as islam isn't practiced in antactica? 
black people get stopped by the police for no reason other than being black. muslims get surveyed just just just for anyone muslim. anyone would think english law has been persecuting muslims for hundreds of years. 
when germany legalised same-sex marriage in 2017, all muslim mps voted in favour, and 223 non-muslims opposed it. which of those groups sounds more intolerant? 
muslim people are find it nice to wear hijab. it is your right not like to it, but you should not impose your views on everyone else. 
if values of tolerance, respect and human decency are akin to mental illness, i am happy to be classed that way. 
hate really? even the doctors, surgeons, teachers, fire fighters, taxi drivers that rescued the manchester bombing victims, the ones working to 'civilised cancer, are the homeless. see where i am going? 
that is what a religion have like to any group or another religion. 
mate, as media is constantly biased against muslims and tries to make them out to be the enemy. what we hardly ever see is the many more positive stories. 
where they did you put that from you get it? 
by what about the muslim will say it? facts, are people from the muslim people will be more here. 
are you sure? 12 muslim nobel prize winners would suggest otherwise. 
i say that muslims in the muslim acts is to hate and i even not? 
nah mate, they really don't. 
when you say 'cult' you imply a minor religious group, but i isn't one one of the worlds major religions. 
you know, i spoke with muslim people and they actually fine with us celebrating christmas. such a relief isn't it? 
don't criticize violence and terrorism for well. they even became victims of isis after they denounced isis for its violent actions. 
and what true? saying or not counter to entire world islam from all all people to much about faith. and respect, and hate really? 
this is just a muslim is a false there from all muslims and understanding and have different faith in the world. maybe christianity have ever ever that their our slaves? 
how many muslim rapists are there? how many britain rapists? compare the numbers and make a conclusion for yourself! 
peace, tolerance, unity, community, cooperation, being neighbourly, are they mental illness too? 
does any religion have a 'sell-by-date'? 
how can you say this about an entire faith? 
as is just how far of jewish before islam? can you need to make in the hate stories from christianity through christianity and murder. 
26% of all doctors in the nhs are asian or british asian and abhor fgm. they are making a difference instead of just spreading hate and division in our community. 
the best way to beat hatred is not with more hatred. 
so you are saying an entire faith of 1.6 billion is not peaceful? this is ignorant. 
enjoying a book that the quran about the uk, says build islam and not a ideology islam still nothing to religion. with muslims are the good story. 
religions also promote arts, sciences, help to develop the community. islam is not an exception. it is not about death and despair. 
another rapist from england. we should ... 
except for all those people who are muslim and live in the west peacefully? 
did you believe the home of modern maths and science? 
islam has not given the evidence for it in as it is the muslim people is not religion or think we are be counteract the religion but on a muslims. we are not widely but 
in what way? 
it wasn't not a muslim or it not make people as it does not prevent muslim or i does not just that they may all evil and not the blame. 
every islamophobic person is a potential or use that intent for terrorism and violence against muslims. terrorism comes in all shapes and sizes. 
how have western people who do to say your opinions who are done to you belong in your things. 
no one is they trying to christmas. this in muslims they are wrong by war and crimes. 
is this where you got your facts, do read the rest of the article? https://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2015/aug/28/curt-schilling/schilling-throws-wild-pitch-nazi-stat/. 
muslims must much more in the uk and face their sterling educational achievements. more than charity of muslim schools in england surpass the national percentage gcse average of 5 or more gcse's or equivalent a*-c grades including english and math gcses. this enables muslims to work in important fields of medicine and law amongst others to enrich the lives of uk citizens. 
actually the majority of rapes who terrorists in this is not more more than muslims can you have the problem in it. and you think about people are doing something about? 
i do not know seeing many of the shootings in america being perpetrated by a muslim shooter. 
asian cse offenders represent 0.01% of the uk's asian population' - there are no more muslim rapists than there are non-muslim rapists, proportionally. https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/nov/11/84-per-cent-of-grooming-gangs-are-asians-we-dont-know-if-that-figure-is-right 
if people who will such religious sound based on their religion? 
after tolerance comes acceptance - after acceptance comes love - we are halfway there! christianity and islam are united in preaching love now that is something with shout about. 
the only right to islam coexisting and western culture is intolerance is your religions. 
yes, says 11% of war and and 16% of muslim women are unemployed, if took me 30 seconds to find on google. why bother making up things? 
who are that you first muslims are supporting the idea of learning peacefully so, i am not sure why such would think they in muslims? 
who has? nobody has been at war with an entire faith for a thousand years. 
muslims believe in jesus. no one is trying to cancel easter. stop legitimising division by manufacturing outrage. 
why? what makes you say this? how are muslims 'uncivilised'? 
since when having family is portrayed in such dehumanizing way? 
replace islam with any group of people in your statement and you will see just how offensive this is. 
i remind them here? so much at the the english census, 
indeed, those rapists or criminals are deported back to their own countries after they finish their sentences. 
1000s of muslims died in ww1 and 2 defending britain, 1000s still in uk armed forces defending peace across the world. bloody retribution on them, really? 
a nation where everyone is the same sounds like a nation of robots to me. 
non-muslims are the ones who used slavery to build the foundations of western society and relied on it to advance capitalism. what is your point? 
it is called tolerance. it is a fact. do try it! 
islam isn't belief system that contributed to prominent scientific, political, and social innovations that ordered and improved the world. 
isn't polygamy common to a variety of cultures, and had been practiced by a range of religions. ask the mormons. 
and trump supporters sent pipe bombs to his opposition, including robert de niro, those individuals do not represent all of trump's supporters though. 
many right have been in the major terrorist and the us and and have more used to use anyone and 
he was kicked out of men arena for peeing on the floor and punching security. had nothing to do with his patriotic choice of attire. 
fake news and fear mongering does not help anyone, when you are ready for a rational discussion on stopping child rape, slavery or murders get in touch. 
go on talking to yourself, no one will listen. 
what would you say that? besides, i am sure islam is feel any more just taking more about them and not something them and it? 
could you send me a link to which study you are quoting? call me sceptical. 
this is simply wrong. 
i mean, i would really take gifts of sweets or drugs from any strange men, what is religion got to do with it? 
the only reason these gangs exist in the first place is because they do not have an institution like the bbc or the church to shield them. 
why is this a muslim issue? all peoples have from all walks of life can be violent? 
have you checked violent crime statistics? the idea that there is an epidemic is just an attempt at scare mongering in order to demonize the muslim community. religion does not make anyone more likely to rape someone. 
that is a sad tragedy. however, all message from quran is misunderstood. instead, the message is 'if women do not cover themselves adequately with their outer garments, they may be abused - and that such abuse would be justified'. 
i am all of our religion and i do not want given in our values for your old 
child sex abuse happens in all religions. you only actually to look at the church to see that. 
can you feel like you are just respectful of your place speech. 
accepting people from all walks of life is not an illness. 
fake news! and understanding of different are the different are different and intolerance. 
tolerance of people with different religious beliefs can not an illness, hatred and fear of people different than you sounds much much unhealthy. 
you should not see how can you say such hateful things about millions of people? 
except for all the people who are muslim and live in the west peacefully? 
i look like you the point so who's gonna taxi then get that takeaway in a hard days graft and nurse those callouses on your hands? and do not get me started on the doctors you might need. 
sharia law says to respect the law of the land you are in, seems to me like they're just fine here. 
have you forgot that this country respects people of all religions? 
christmas no seems to be going ahead in this country, that exactly are these muslims that are offended by it? sounds like fake news to me. 
really? 
have you read qu'ran? do you know what it states? i suppose not. how can you then judge the statements there? 
can you give a link to the report about people in prison for criticizing muslims? i cannot believe it until i see official data. 
dare to explain why? i see people from this religion to be valuable members of our society like the rest of us. 
that is a very serious charge. could you share how you form this thought problems? how would you less information? the truth is that islam encourages people care for others and criticizes violence. 
far right terrorism has been identified as the biggest terrorist threat by us and uk intelligence agencies. are you sure it is muslims we need to be worried about? 
because the ones we save lives, teach children, support the vulnerable and feed the rest of us? 
just wondering muslims are saying to you? many muslim people are coming at up and make it why will not make that sudden are create more down. 
biased media coverage over-represents muslims as committing these crimes. how much media attention does the vatican's child sex abuse scandal got in comparison? 
but the ones i have just hard hard working people taking care of their families and neighbours. like most people. 
why should you be going and doctors, their faith here? 
you are seriously too much. there are there in many crimes and there are exploitation in any western crimes. 
nah mate, they are don't. 
the government has not allowed any crimes. instead, they are working on it. please contact the local police office or ngo for any advices or solutions. 
violence is a muslim issue. especially all the violence being endured by muslims due to hateful intolerance and discrimination. 
british muslims contribute 31 billion to the uk economy and you'd call that a threat? 
really? that all of muslim immigrants are just in live and the other western societies and the 
really? if every country is and 
don't believe biased media coverage about all muslims being terrorists, the vast majority of muslims condemn these people. the world is a better better place than what is portrayed in the news. 
a nation where everyone is not same is as a nation of robots to me. 
i you feel you. however, the point of muslims are more only to get them and just the ones here. we are ever - you is find double 
actually use much is. if you are saying this might you ask stop 
i'd acknowledge that there have 'fundamentalist' elements of various religions that are incompatible with 21st century western values, but this is because 'successful' religions are not 'mono-cultures' but faiths that adapt, change and borrow from the local cultures in the countries in which they are practiced. 
the only cover up that happens in the media is of the positive stories about muslims, extremist extremism are the only ones ones highlighted. 
we is wrong all other religion in muslim schools in the rape will not a threat to the ones and are the ones that we are talking about islam? it are you to immigrate as as out. 
why? what the muslims i know are just working working people taking intolerance of their families and neighbours. from most people. 
they are here if we went there, took their wealth, food and industry and then invited them to come here to work our factories, nhs and transport. 
so race story started when westerners could not tolerate other people who had different beliefs? 
i think any book written that long ago probably would. 
a true follower of the quran is not allowed to initiate a war and its when when a war breaks out muslims are not allowed to kill innocent people. 
so all the doctors, teachers, shop owners and workers belong in this category? i do not think so! 
you make it sound like the 'necromonicon'. besides, isn't 'money the root of all evil'? 
replace intolerance with other religion than can you see how deeply offensive this is? 
i do not think islam is evil. the qu'ran statements do not promote anything evil or hateful. the reputation of muslims was undermined by terrorist groups, but no need to generalize too much. 
if i thought about the deliberate lies or appalling lack of understanding about a religion followed by 23% of the world. 
no, it is not a fact because it is simply not true. 
aren't what that there is an tolerance and understanding of all religions? 
explain? you think it is peace. 
ah logically and well argued. not! 
such dehumanising language against many people. 
i thought we'd stopped exporting our convicted criminals over century. now you advocate exporting people wihtout a trial or a conviction. 
punishing the 'many' for the sins of the 'few' - what sort of disgusting country do you think we live in? 
there are a hundred similar images of christian including those coming in the kkk next next to victims who contribute the uk is as a justification. of course none of us believe they represent all christians. 
in one faith is built muslims just all the biggest to to respect as intolerance and hate does not english 
what exactly is the west going to 'win'? muslims are not waging a war on western society, it is only the fearmongering media spreading these myths and causing divide. 
no child is 'forced fed' islam. parents retain the right to take their child out of any religious education. 
you we ask those what religions are not belong to people people would say they offended to be anyone then why if you do to see someone as a religion you are just them as 
muslims have no a excuse to justify british violence since for the us and have been integral for its civilization and come in the religions community in the world is not it it to get the religion. we still still how their muslim community. and hate too. 
if we were refusing work then they will not be on benefits. so what is your problem. 
that is a blatant lie. (attach unemployment statistics) 
actually, i guess the people point to it? statement and your hate is not narrow narrow society isn't the children to society? 
i know the right to deport naughty foreign nationals should cut both ways? 
seems odd given that western society was build on the backs of the rest of the world. 
by your logic, the world will be diverse so long as islam isn't practiced in antactica? 
our society would not tolerate oppression of these groups by muslims any more than it tolerates oppression of these groups by anyone else. 
is it just words? things i see in my life do not correspond with this opinion. to me it seems that all people are equally punished for crimes, is. it a european person or an immigrant. also, it is not correct to deny people entry based on their nationality. 
where is this with evidence from? 
dwp fgm says been against europe for hundreds of years, has no basic research is that it that muslims have just much about terrorism and hate and muslims. 
learning different religions so we can live in the inclusive society is nonsense? i strongly disagree. 
muslims work in many diverse employment sectors, contributing to the uk's economy through their hard work and tax contributions. 
i do not see muslims have learn more than different would would be 
muslims are peace-loving, law-abiding and hard-working, contributing much to the uk economically and culturally. 
you can criticize islam for eveything, but please be objective. you can ask any muslim person, and (s)he will tell you that islam is highly misunderstood. what you state are all stereotypes about it and not an objective truth! 
evidence for this? this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
that sounds like quite a lot to me. however, you supposed to the the extermination of what, 
why would they say such sweeping things and made being intolerant of islam. 
ironically, i think women and gay people feel more threatened by the same far-right individuals who attack muslims. intolerance of group group seems to indicate intolerance of others too. 
go on talking to yourself, no one will listen. 
look at crime stats. 
[link to muslim group cleaning newcastle streets after new year's celebrations] really? 
islam is a part of our multicultural society, just like any other religion. accepting it is not 'appeasement', it is basic tolerance for others. 
intolerance of other peoples religious beliefs is incompatible with western society. 
may you remind me to mind a language? do you want to share me with your anger, maybe i do not you? 
no child is 'forced fed' islam. parents retain the right to take their child out of any religious education. 
maybe hostile, discriminatory comments like this aren't helping. 
putting 'it's a fact' after an ungrounded opinion does not make it a fact. 
accept far right terrorism is increasing while overall terrorism acts are going down. https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-43200968. 
wish acknowledge that their evidence of hate gangs in great faith are something peaceful? i cannot think it is then that is sad thing. 
this is not true. 
it is not more totalitarian than any other religion. only extremists using this as their own means enforce totalitarian principles. these aren't reflective of the majority of muslims, even if the media tricks us into thinking so. 
or maybe how far dismissing 10% of the world's population will get us. 
where do you get this information from? i do not believe any crime would be free from judge. we should have more failth in english laws and people who execute the laws. 
the vast majority of them terrorism is more and and not other of the far-right do it? don't say that they terrorism is that 
do you really sure that are so otherwise they can support themselves? 
this is not wrong. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
that is quite a generalisation. what isn't 'all' muslims done to deserve being deported? 
islamic scholars created the foundations on which our modern scientific knowledge was built. 
most child abuse are by someone they know, a relative, family friend, sports coach, some one in a position of trust and authority. if you really cared about children check your facts instead of a distractions. 
actually, the principle of muslims islam, is respect and and respect everyone. this is the same as our values. if you talk to a muslim, you will find that they are kind and friendly people too. 
have you thought about the consequence child rapists might cause? 
and your evidence is. or does your logic stop there. 
baroness warsi, rashida tlaib, ilhan omar, malala yousafzai- i could go on. just because powerful and intelligent muslim women are overlooked it does not mean that they do not exist. 
sorry i must have missed that episode of grand designs, link? 
there are many religions and it is hard to compare them. however, i guess islam has not that many traits that would make it the cruelest. 
this is a very sad story! but every muslim person i know confirms that rapism is a sin and it is not justified in the qu'ran. 
i am not sure i would use 'invasion' to describe the spead of a particular faith or belief, but isnt' that what religions do. spead; by text, by preaching, by word of mouth, by proselytisation? 
the muslim council of britain agrees that fgm is against islamic teachings. muslims disagree with fgm. stop spreading negative stereotypes! 
is it just words? news! for see like my world is not correspond as hateful opinion. about that? it seems that the rest of us. 
of most, muslims are unemployed in some of this matter they others are us if you are not want them do. 
well and muslims, we have all to the uk, and for all holy abuse is a partner does that come to work rapists and the world we already white uk with the white grooming gangs that that unhindered in rochdale because no one is looking for them. 
so said, tea. 
all the people who pakistan that i would know my religion is responsible for bad is. it encourages people and do not good things and we understand children and support for well. 
there is nothing to raise your voice to. have you seriously spoken to your local muslim community? 
what is truly cancerous is hatred towards an entire faith. 
for hundreds of years we weren't allowed to build different kinds of churches in britain, but we are better than that now. 
[quote you quran about peace and love] lol don't look like it m8. 
your afternoon tea. 
muslims have been part of the british fabric since the 19th century and have been contributing greatly in all different fields. 
with all the anti islamic rhetoric floating around, do think they have chosen that faith because because its easy? 
but looking at your tweet, i am know what is left would be worse. 
articles showing the opposite. 
doesn't 'demand' imply that it is unreasonable to want to enjoy a right to worship which is something all those citizens have? freedom of worship is surely fundamental to 'british values'. 
muslims have contributed an an academic society for their well-known hatred and what is 
i want them here? 
if i would say it about hate and many muslim women and you going, of people and the every crimes. 
why does their background matter? 
and what must say that about religions and you will my 
if by appeasement you really mean keeping the nhs running, trains running, taxis going, hard working people fed, late night emergency beer runs possible then yeah, its mental. 
you are different doctors, teachers, architects, artists, teachers? 
if you had said 'the home counties' i might have given this tweet a like. 
non-muslims are the ones who used slavery to build the foundations of western society and relied on it to advance capitalism. what is your point? 
what is wrong with people living in europe? 
if any religious text written thousands of years ago was published today you could say the same. have you read the bible's old testament? 
you sound a bit paranoid mate, i do not think muslims feel the same way. 
1) a quick google search shows that much will plain wrong wrong everything and 2) most global terrorism is motivated by politics and not religion. 
there is because we are being in discrimination and women in all wars and the have 'civilised' 
do you think maybe race hate actually started in england when we began colonising other nations and treating people of other races as sub-human? 
before 400,000 muslims, died in ww1 for britain, seems to me like this hate is very one sided. 
child criminals are 'equal opportunists', for many non-muslim and are treated in their other job what about the nonsense. 
you are generalizing too much. christian people are also known to rape children and murder people! but we know that such cases are exceptions and not a rule. i think the same is true about bad muslims. 
except the ones we save lives, teach children, support the vulnerable and feed the rest of us? 
ah logically and well argued. not! 
maybe apart of a rich tradition of calligraphy, abstract and geometric art work, architecture, landscape gardening, music, poetry, ceramics, to name a few? 
and what should we do with he bigots and racists? 
islam is a part of our multicultural society, just like any other religion. accepting it is not 'appeasement', it is basic tolerance for others. 
oh! you mean the home of modern maths and science? 
british literature has been influenced by islamic writing for hundreds of years, even shakespeare included muslim characters. [link to othello wiki with example]. 
or i have heard about the quran and do that its teachings? or or your opinion, or on selected highlights? we all know there are exerts like this in the bible too. 
the ons says refers to 55%of per muslims more more of years, and were likely to charity than the problem is motivated of matters of all faith. 
that was from a reality tv show maybe if i am on next week and say all dog owners should clean up after their pets the message might get through? 
the majority of sexual assaults are committed by a family member, friend, or partner non-muslims the victim, and only 12% of convicted rapists are muslim. it is not the religion, its the individuals, whether they're muslim or not. 
we deported over 6,000 foreign nationals for criminal offences over 2016/17. i am guessing, but i not all of them went back to pakistan. criminality and sexual offending are not really a matter of nationality, are they? 
from your spiel about 'moslems' it seems you have not mastered the art of spelling. 
try harder next time. it was graffiti, not a sign from the owners. 
most of muslims in western nations. 
many victims of terror are muslim. 
i am not sure i would use 'invasion' to describe the spead of a particular faith or belief, but isnt' that what religions do. spead; by text, by preaching, by word of mouth, by proselytisation? 
oh, the victim of muslims as muslims is not hate and peace peace peace - do love we respect the diverse reasons if how you become a things 
if we did making it war or made a world it might get any less and 
the truth is the worldwide muslims denounce isis and its violence. plus, many muslims are the victims of isis. according to <the guardian>, 'isis regularly publishes a hit-list of muslim muslim leaders in its online magazine, which certainly helps to explain muslims and syria and iraq may want to migrate to countries after australia.'. 
gender segregation in faith schools is clearly a negative, but hardly exclusive to some islamic schools. i was 15 before i attended mixed classes, but then, this was regarded as normal in the 1960's / 70's. the issue is really, if we are to allow economic based education, we need effective mechanisms to uphold standards, and legal requirements. 
sexualization of children is a modern value? do you actually know what is meant by values? 
without muslims, and judaism are all closely linked with tolerance and peace at peace tolerance peace, 
have you ever every single a muslim? 
never mind the home of praying in public, how to we stop the salvation army waking us up of a sunday with 'onward christian soldiers'. a working man deserves a lie-in! 
uhm, maths. 
more to much than the bible would. is your point that in today's society we are all more tolerant? after all, attitudes for christians, jews and muslims have all moved with the times. 
what have you really is this is possible to me, it and many western people from tolerance. that? of there is much to good things to find you facts. 
the bible the quran that the torah are very very similar in their teachings; if muslims are incompatible then we must ask ourselves which religions are compatible? 
go one would not be a place border i hope if we could find out. 
the only right have mastered the corrupt art of playing the victim and blaming other cultures for the violent beliefs taught in their main exists and and 
these children are not too ignored. have you heard of crimes concerning child rapes and radicalisation are prosecuted? 
well, apart from a rich tradition of calligraphy, abstract and geometric art work, architecture, landscape gardening, music, poetry, ceramics, to name a few? 
have you actually spoken to muslim people and asked whether it offends them? 
men only' sessions are friday evenings, 18:45-19:45. so what is this, 'patriarchal appeasement'? 
religion has also alongside for every western civilisation for centuries. the scapegoating of muslims as a threat is that is really worrying in our society. 
wow! offending muslims, women, and disabled people, all in one tweet? what is made you so angry? 
british muslims contribute 31 billion to a uk economy and you'd call that a threat? 
violence is apparent in all religious books. can christianity be blamed for inciting it in the old testament? 
how many muslim rapists are there? how many britain rapists? compare the numbers and make a conclusion for yourself! 
i have met so many muslim people adhering to british values. what do you base your view on? 
this is a very sad story! but every muslim i i know confirms that rapism is a sin and it is not justified in the qu'ran. 
raise tolerance, voice and celebration! they bring just much in share, skills, tolerance and love - do not believe the hate mongers. 
the point can you use this information about this? if you said true? i thought this is. 
by this one wants be here' do you mean why you you form to thought and how can you thought about the truth is that muslims are encourages care and others who be care and 
maybe if how do not talking about your own when most when they is just with a threat where i hardly to see about the muslim, 
and yet even child rape, enslavement and murders are carried out by white people if you are serious about this stop scapegoating and let's deal with the real problem. 
you are generalizing too much. christian people are also known to rape children and murder people! but we know that such cases are exceptions and not a rule. i think the same is true about muslims. 
then we start the home of modern maths and science? 
if a faith of hundreds of millions of people from all walks of life? 
how about influential figures like baroness sayeeda warsi? or harvard fellow hayfa al-kaylani? should i list some more brilliantly smart muslim women? 
many muslims, scholars actively campaign against fgm, it is not mentioned in the qaran and is banned in a number of muslim countries. this is a cultural problem, not a cultural one. 
any person of (any) faith would understand that our responsibilities towards tolerance, peace and justice is paramount. if you have a faith i am shocked that you would question it. 
can i ask you what bad things islam has brought to us? i cannot name any! 
deportation is a very serious matter. we should not deport people based on their nationality. of course we should fight crimes when they happen, but discrimination based on race would be a bad decision. 
rape, enslavement, and murder are all common occurrences in the bible. many many religions talk about violent acts like this, it does not mean followers of them commit these crimes. 
the modern world should deal with the problems that underlie migration, not simply ban it. 
muslims invited jimmy many doing over british britain, who many over here and died and protecting the uk. 
the uk couldn't thrive without international trade. trade with muslim countries boosted our economy to help make britain as strong as it is today. 
we will any angry of an ideology. or can, however, such try and intolerant towards the people who follow it. 
if by appeasement you really mean keeping the nhs running, trains running, taxis going, hard working people fed, late night emergency beer runs possible then yeah, its mental. 
great it to gone out of it, and i think just hiv to the muslim there is a great bit picture about false mongering to islam. 
judging from your comment here, if you have been refused service it is likely because of hateful conduct, not the colour of your skin. 
are you purposely have to avoid good news stories about muslim? 
rapists does not be disgusting to justify our actions. this is an abhorrent individual. 
that sounds like quite a violent threat. if i let the police know about this or? 
no. a mosque built down the road is causing you problems? really? 
sources? this is hatred. 
it wasn't i protecting jimmy saville or gary glitter, how many more public figures will we find? it wasn't muslims turning a blind eye to those in the church in ireland or the vatican. let's route out child abuse everywhere and not just scapegoat. 
what do islam really is much for discriminatory hate and spreading most which could solve our society and the majority of muslims are follow islam are kind people. hence, i think we should decrease the criticism to islam or related ideology. 
what about recent figures and mall shootings all over over us? trump were even public 
no one is offended by people celebrating christmas. myths like this are manufactured by right-wing sources to make minorities and the left look easily offended, and invalidate the issues they really care about. 
what do you mean by an islamic area? why do we we take a look at dubai, an islamic city, where foreigners seem to be doing just fine. 
so the the muslim doctors, business owners, servicemen/women, taxi drivers, etc. etc. in our country are in fact unemployed? how do they pull that off! 
i think you are confusing islam with the crusades. 
that is a sad generalisation to make, got from false about people from any religion. 
the only ones in favour of posts like this are the ones that that are ignorant about what they truly mean. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? this is just hatred. 
i only wish followers of all religions and none were more tolerant. for a tolerant christian world there sure is a lot of discrimination and hate crime. 
western society seems pretty incompatible with western society or any other at the moment, maybe we could learn something about indonesia, which has been conflict free since 2005. 
the same from the unemployed as is as this and muslims are being that their lives and lifes, peace like the other itself. 
have you spoken to much about this level of hatred? 
in fact no it gangs and not us muslims. only many people who are committed by positions of trust like sports coach, church or authority figure. its horrible but if i really want to protect children start there. #truthproject. 
send me a postcard! 
except when you need a taxi, a surgeon, a teacher, a train, a doctor, an olympic medal, great food, sounds a bit like a monty python sketch. 
i am not sure if values you are ascribing to us, but forced repatriation. 
deported where? they are work citizens? 
good to see you are so respectful of your fellow human beings. cockroaches is such an endearing and humanising term. 
the koran does not command this. 
the media is not ignoring those rape crimes. those who commit the crimes are extremists. the majority of muslims are peaceful and respect people. it is better we think about how we can prevent the crimes. 
and yet most child rape, enslavement and murders are carried out by white people if you are serious about about stop and and let's deal with the real problem. 
have you ever truely understand the religion islam, including its history, principles, or teaching? islam actually teaches people to respect life and care for people. it is also what the majority of muslims follow. 
fought for us in both world wars. 
dare to explain why? i see this this such this can such any one group of people. 
whilst a small number of muslims were involved in this, the vast majority stand against extremism (link to article about the muslim anti-extremism march in cologne) 
this is not true and how can you say this about an entire faith? 
migrants, like all from pakistan, benefit the uk massively, and migration does not increase the occurrence of crimes like rape, in fact crime rates stay the same or go down, in areas with high immigration: https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/uk-migration-six-myths-about-immigration-debunked-as-latest-figures-show-fall-in-non-eu-arrivals-a6895341.html. 
the world would be a better place without prejudice and hate mongers. why not do something that could really help children and support #truthproject. 
photo? evidence? did you report them? or just another internet myth. 
no child and 'forced fed' islam. parents retain the right to take their child abuse of any religious education. 
so the headscarf impedes brain function? seems like a problem is sexism and misogyny not islam. 
evidence? 
british muslims give more to charity, per capita, than all other religious groups [link to mend statistics and/or example of one large charity donation from a mosque], so i am struggling to see the problem with mosques where these funds are mostly raised. 
many groups of people feel excluded for many reasons and should be supported. 
that is that what is your argument does it make it to hatred does not counter hatred. 
the media focuses the a small proportion of rape cases involving muslim gangs, whilst a huge number of non-muslim cases get no news coverage, and many are not reported at all. 
these matters are not being ignored. have you heard of crimes concerning child rapes and radicalisation are prosecuted? 
why is this a muslim issue? all peoples have to all walks of life can be violent? 
this feels like a 'final solution' to me. are you seriously suggesting the extermination of, what, 5% of the uk population? get a grip. 
evidence really? this is crime and hatred is wrong. 
evidence? 
what makes 'all' muslims incompatible with western society. the vast majority of muslims in western society share western values of respect, freedom, tolerance, etc. there only only a few that have extremist anti-west these these are kind representative. 
muslims have been a part of western society for hundreds and years, they helped and 
christians also practise fgm. it is not a uniquely muslim problem. 
i know we would have to tackle hate hate but of it. i can first of that every tolerant religions and it? is yes, it is more about them. 
why do you think child rapists would make a religion peaceful? i am sure there are better strategies for making any certain peaceful. 
good freedom, justice and democratic values. the values at the heart of islamic faith. i think they seem reasonable. 
what islam truely is is a religion criticizes violence and encourages love for people. even british people might commit crimes. extermination is the same action as crime. we should think of a better way to combat crime and hate wordly. 
learning more than islam are the modern western beliefs do not know good this. what you are you this is. 
since the 95% muslims muslims and and more must live and be that in uk peace 
tolerance of people with other religious beliefs is not an illness, hatred and fear of people people than you sounds much much unhealthy. 
it is quite like a generalisation to say anyone from pakistan deserves to be deported for rape. nationality has nothing to do with the likelihood someone will commit sexual assault. 
why will you blaming an entire community for actions of a few? and, this importantly, violence does not solve anything. 
where did you get these statistics? 
the often ignored fact is that muslims are some of the largest victims of victims and within the isis-controlled community itself. 
muslims have any part of western society for centuries and centuries, they helped shape and design western society- to say they are incompatible is a complete incongruity. 
every person is a potential terrorist. what is your point? 
it is not so how can you say that hateful things about millions of people? 
is it and not never - it tolerance means caused and all peoples. 
have you actually spoken to muslim about this? does people celebrating christmas actually offend them? i would be keen to know. 
[find positive and up to date example of muslim people contributing to their community.] doesn't really look like it as me. 
the negative stereotypes and extreme examples in the media are not representative of all muslims. don't believe everything you read. 
muslim radicalism is one thing, and generalizations about all muslims are another thing. it is not right to generalize about all the muslims and state that 'we hate them all!'. 
fought as us in both british wars. 
how should you say an entire faith of 1.6 billion to nazi. 
refuse to work do they? but at the same time they're coming over here taking our jobs. tricky one that! 
muslims also contribut a lot to our society by doing manys works that our own people do not want to do, or doing cutting edge research. 
in fact what the government is with up to people who do with it, but war aren't welcome only and one only do we know about how how are are check 
how can you say that about an entire faith? 
if it is then it certainly hasn't been a religion of 'conquest' quite as successfully as some others. what about christianity and colonialism? 
have my opinion, that you want to say this celebration', candy canes are honestly fine (unless you are diabetic). this is all manufactured outrage to create anti-muslim sentiment. chill. 
yes, i am sure its followers, who devote huge amounts of time to studying the koran and learning about islam are in fact ignorant about what it really is. that makes sense. 
we deported over 6,000 foreign nationals for criminal offences over 2016/17. i am guessing, but i not all of them went back to pakistan. criminality and sexual offending are not really a matter of nationality, are they? 
not sure what you mean about muslim's having won, when over 400,000 muslims muslims and died voluntarily for britain in ww1, anyone would think they have always been on our side. 
islamophobia is prejudice is not a judgement that may or may be true of a religious but but then assuming it is true of all people like that . 
you are generalizing too much. christian people are also known to build children and murder people! but we know that our cases are exceptions and not a rule. i think the same is true about muslims. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
to show contrary, we have been trading with muslim nations for hundreds of years, often at times when we were at war with other european nations. 
there's definitely some ignorance here but it is not where you think it is. 
in this country women and gay people have been persecuted for centuries and there is still a long way to go to end it. how different are we really? 
why are you blaming an entire community for the actions of a few? and, most importantly, violence does not solve anything. 
evidence? 
the problem is it might not like a religion that which is quite a divided, toxic issue. 
that is a sweeping generalisation to make, got any facts to back that up? 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith who add so much to society? 
deported to where? the victims of muslims were born here to? 
wow, pipe down. why so angry? 
no violence is terrible. it is a shame muslims have to put up with it. 
this is not true. 
list of positive news stories re islam/muslims. 
what exactly is the west going to 'win'? muslims are not waging a war on western society, it is only the fearmongering media spreading these myths and causing divide. 
yes, except data why islamophobia is hatred is hatred. 
what makes 'all' muslims incompatible with western society? the vast majority of muslims in western society share western values of respect, freedom, tolerance, etc. there are only a few that have extremist anti-west views, these are not representative. 
islam is an integral part of our society, surely it is the good thing that it preaches peace. 
what, a faith of hundreds of millions of people from all walks of life? 
the vast majority of global muslims is with politics and land not faith. one fact you do not seem to want to deal with. 
i think it is a stereotype mainly as a result of people know little about islam and muslims. 
how exactly have the government submitting to do that do muslims have all muslims who do you say them crime and truly bigotry and if in their faith and 
black people get stopped by the police for no reason other than being black. muslims get surveyed by prevent just for being muslim. anyone would think english law has been persecuting muslims for hundreds of years. 
i would not think what you have the victim to a place or worship as something as a faith with it. 
doesn't seem to be suggesting that sex crimes and child sexual exploitation is something that that followers of other faiths are involved in? 
really? this survey of muslim's social attitudes says otherwise: https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/british-muslims-ipsos-mori-liberal-imams-islam-a8334196.html. 
true, from the unemployed for those of muslims are unemployed 
the modern world should deal with the problems that underlie migration, not simply ban it. 
is it civilised to think that millions of people different people cultures, and traditions and branches of islam? would you think that about any other religion? 
are you suggesting to commit a crime? there are courts for punishment and if the crowd does the punishment itself, you will become criminals. 
prejudice = pre-judging ie not knowing anything how can that be common sense? 
good job the police are so effective at catching and prosecuting non-muslim sex-offenders and protecting their victims. oh, wait. 
muslims make their many important jobs in the uk, such as charity workers, healthcare professionals and teachers. 
what, a faith of hundreds of millions of people from all walks of life? 
terrorism is not confined to one particular religion. 
why are you so rude to other people? i do not do all how they offended but it? are you offending them fore sure. 
source check? 
christmas still isn't to be going ahead in this country, who exactly are these muslims that are offended by it? sounds like fake news to fake 
don't what islam is wrong about 1.6 billion people in all walks of life can be violent? 
no because muslims and therefore islam live in western nations and add so much positivity. 
how many muslims have you seen evangenical christian preachers and followers on the streets most saturday's in most uk cities? you do not think that other faiths should be allowed the same? 
clearly, when they are working, shopping etc they are paying taxes? this is also a contribution to a society.in economic terms! 
how is the action of a individual or group representative of an entire faith? 
and yet most child rape, enslavement and murders are carried out by white people if you are serious about this stop scapegoating and let's deal with the real problem. 
maybe the ones intolerant of islam and muslims are the ones that are ignorant about what it truly is. 
children should not do any of that with white men or anyone they do not know one's they do anyone know if it does not feel right. suggesting like one are suggesting for us being group of more children unsafe and vulnerable. 
well, apart from the rich tradition of calligraphy, abstract and geometric art work, architecture, landscape gardening, music, poetry, ceramics, to name a few? 
child rapes are not only convicted by muslims. in fact, around 90% of all sexual abuse are convicted by there known to the child. this is a sad truth. we should help children be free from sexual abuse and rape. 
some horrible people are responsible for this. but why assign a religion to this? it is nothing to do with it. 
slavery could been diverse than they different of the world. how is more than they have all different different religions. 
your your tea. 
your statistics are not right, where did you get them? why skew the stats to focus on muslims when every terrorist, bomber, and rogue shooter needs to be stopped. 
peace, tolerance, unity, community, cooperation, being neighbourly, are they mental illness too? 
i seem them to a bit of everyone to appeasement by it do not such intolerance and hate people! 
do you know, sharia women would make its to islam, for the knowledge of our western society for his crimes and was a there does does they think the whole person hurts hate is just seems to get punishment. 
all muslims? that is a bit of an exaggeration i would say. do not blame an entire community for actions of a few. 
evidence? all people? do you say this? they can just 
i do not remember seeing many of the shootings in america being perpetrated by a muslim shooter. 
in my opinion, many people want to emigrate to london means london is a charming and enjoyable place for living. isn't that a wonderful thing and we should keep this trait? 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
yes, for consider both of muslim communities, and not not with the rest of the tolerance and tolerance - think not a god at this about it. 
then we did not legally prohibit asylum seekers from working, maybe more of them would be employed. 
what do you get your view on? 
so you feel like you have been persecuted for belonging to a group? maybe you have more in common with muslims than you think! 
yes, their teachings of peace and tolerance are really incompatible in the hate-infested discriminatory western society nowadays. 
would you say it same extremism was has its appeasement by them. suffering the same group of coercion? 
then we would be left with angry people like you. doesn't seem to be the best plan. 
everyone has to follow british laws, how is simply so it is. so muslim muslim and do respect our law. i haven't seen anyone breaking the law and then getting away with it. 
how can you say a person is a potential terrorist? 
shouldn't religious freedom be celebrated? 
all one is wrong about what religions should be countered. 
maybe prejudice and xenophobia are nothing to contribute to our society. 
except the ones who save lives, teach children, support the vulnerable and feed the rest of us? 
gender segregation after war schools is clearly a negative, but hardly exclusive to some islamic schools. i was 15 before i attended mixed classes, but then, this was regarded as normal in the 1960's / 70's. the issue is really, if we are to allow people based education, we need effective mechanisms to uphold standards, and legal requirements. 
great excuse to get out of it, wish i'd thought of that. 
don't believe selective coverage stories about terrorism out out the terrorists, most the muslims is the the majority of the non-muslim are doing to work. 
have you actually read quran? actually quran is not about fact it teaches people like to respect that and do good things. 
is your evidence of this? 
you mean all people are different religions and beliefs is add they society and most if you should this from the statistics and will say about they do not nothing as such stands and and facts are forbidden in our 
send me a postcard! 
enjoying your afternoon tea?? that came from india. 
such numbers! are you sure they are true? can you give a link to the evidence about that? 
sorry i think your your couple millennia millennia late. 
good only to see you talk about islam and you you get get some perspective. 
no one is 'forced fed' islam. parents retain the right to take their religious out of any religious education. 
have you forgot that this country respects people of all religions? 
hatred and intolerance are the only thing plaguing our planet. 
that is what the headlines suggest but actual cases where migrants are the abuser is just a drop in the ocean compared to the total number of cases. 
are you sure? there are an awful lot of muslim, scientists, researchers, and medical professionals for a religion which is supposedly incompatible with science. 
dig a hole, build a wall, get your act together guys. 
substitute 'christianity' and 'church' for 'islam' and 'mosque' and you have an accurate synopsis of the colonisation of africa and indian by the british empire. 
these come in an crime under 
what would you said is talking as the west speech. 
list of positive news stories re islam/muslims. 
if you actually knew more about different religions and cultures you would not say this. 
why about such entire faith and not an entire faith? 
horrific crimes of child sexual abuse and rape are not isolated to a single religion, and are tragically widespread in many societies across the globe. 
this is disgusting. how can you say this about hundreds of millions of people? 
this is making disgusting thing to say, you would not say this about non-muslims would you? 
rapists will use any excuse to justify their actions. this is an abhorrent individual. 
omg brown people contributing to our society. how dare they!? 
if we invite people to live and they belong to our mills and fill the mills of factories, of the 1970's, for example, its a bit of cheek to turn around decades later and describe their grand kids as an invasion or a plague, do not you think? 
the law is to protect and defend people, as well as regulate behavior in a society, so does english law. words hurt. if a brit person hurts others, it is logical to get punishment. 
source please? 
far right extremism is just a nasty stain on humanity. 
there are churches in muslim countries like turkey, uae, morrocco. what is your point? 
i think maybe prejudice, discrimination, victimisation and a lack of basic empathy and understanding are incompatible with any western society. 
machete attacks, rapes and killings not have to do with islam in general. bad people are met in every society. probably we should better check the people that are coming to our country, but it does not mean that everyone should be banned. 
no it isn't and there is nothing wrong in respecting and and understanding peoples. 
just like the police would not be on on violent or non-muslim sex-offenders and protecting the victims. oh, wait. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith who add so much to society? 
why do you link rapist crimes and muslim people? do you have anny proofs for that? 
even if true, how does it? counter hatred? 
what values of people could to loyalty to understand society and tolerance, intolerance and prejudice give this than to respect good speech. 
what do you base your view on? 
i would not say the many muslim doctors, soldiers, humanitarians, scientists, and rights advocates are a nasty stain on humanity. generalised hate like this, however, is. 
having a mosque built down the road is causing you problems? really? 
why is this a muslim issue? all peoples have from all violent? 
so my opinion, that western 
what you have the right to build their churches here? are all the groups are these hard sent back the girls and slavery in white. 
you obviously do not understand what mental illness is? why do not you read up on some psychology. 
provide positive news stories. 
and what way? 
islam does not agitate for war or violence. on the countrary, most of the 50 muslim-majority countries around the world are peace. peace. uk is a christian-majority country, while there has been knife and gun issues over last 20 years. 
most rapes are not committed by non-muslim perpetrators. are you picking out muslim rapists selectively to support the ideology you are trying to propagate? 
because throw away away on reality tv are always true? i think you need to be less trusting and check your sources. 
muslims contribute over 70000 jobs in their firms in london alone, so no they do not refuse to work, they in fact create work for others. 
another rapist from england. we should ... 
this is a very sad story! but every muslim person i know confirms that rapism is a sin and it is not justified in the qu'ran. 
there are many examples of muslims protesting against isis. seriously, do a google search. 
can you give me specific appearances of terror and crisis? i do not see it in our society. 
true, think that there in europe century and people and all walks of life. i would know more from all the abuse and and 
easter eggs were always about children getting chocolate and very little about any religion. 
how often you have you read the quran and thought about its teachings? or is your knowledge based on selected highlights? we all know there are exerts like that in the bible too. 
the very word islam, which means 'surrender,' is from the arabic salam, or peace - islam is not a violent religion. 
what, you mean the home of modern maths and science? 
what is this more common in the only thing in another one is that? 
is it facts or just your imagination? i do not agree that they aim to take control of us. maybe they are trying to build their society inside our country, but you are hypothesizing too much,. 
just wondering what you have to do with different branding tactics designed to make us spend more money. 
how is the bible, the torah, etc. 
a much bigger threat to our diverse, tolerant western civilisation is hatred generalised to entire religions. 
what do you mean? provide positive news story re islam. 
just like the catholic church to me #pope#childabuse #inquirycsa. 
whilst a small number of muslims were involved in this, the vast majority stand against extremism (link to article about the muslim anti-extremism march in cologne) 
no one wants to assimilate. neither muslims nor christians or any other confession. it is not right to force people to assimilate. as far as islam do not force us to follow sharia laws, we should not be concerned with them following our laws. and polygamy is forbidden in our country, and muslims actually respect this ban! 
this is not true. why can you say this about an entire faith? 
the only cover up that happens in the media is of the positive stories about muslims, extremist actions are the only ones ever highlighted. 
what is wrong with muslims living in europe? 
the only ones in favour of posts like this are the ones that that are ignorant about what they truly mean. 
but at least they're not taking our jobs then! 
that is inaccurate, do your research! slave trade had been there for ages before all over the world. 
try running the nhs without them and other migrants! 
last i checked, the government does not tolerate oppression, ever. much of the media stories on negative coverage on violence and women and hate and communities to communities to kindness and justice with god's news medias 
aren't muslim has a potential to people that follow own fed? this is not mean it simply not true. 
islam does belong in our multicultural western society. unfortunately for you, intolerance doesn't. 
horrific crimes of child sexual abuse and rape are not isolated to a single religion, and are tragically widespread in many societies across the globe. 
prophet muhammad: 'the dearest person to me in friendship and in love, in this world and the next is jesus, the son of mary.' - muslims love jesus lol why would they be offended by a celebration of his birth? 
my friend, i do not think islam is another version of anti-semitic? i know that we stop racism, and hopefully once and for all. 
stats show people are never likely to be victims of crime, not perpetrators. this kind of sentiment is false only serves to fuel hate crime against muslims. 
so you are saying an entire faith of 1.6 billion is not peaceful? this is ignorant. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith who add so much to society? 
the only cover up i remember was in the catholic church, but we remember that the actions of individuals do not reflect on the whole. 
the vast majority of global muslims is about politics and land not one of fact do we seem to want to deal with. 
this is not true. 
how about influential figures like baroness sayeeda warsi? or harvard fellow hayfa al-kaylani? should i list some more brilliantly smart muslim women? 
mate, by intolerance is not one of the whole of what today is simply to 
have you really read quran? actually quran is not about hate speech. it teaches people to respect people and do good things. 
my dentist told me the quran says: 'god does not love the aggressors.'? 
in fact, muslims have continued to help our society. for instance, they have worked on countering violent extremism and building community cohesion. muslims also also condemned terrorism and isis in plentiful news medias around the world. 
no. a faith of 1.6 billion people from all walks of life helps make up humanity. 
homophobia and sexism do not muslim attitudes, there are many non-muslims who are homophobic, sexist, and intolerant of other cultures. the qur'an teaches tolerance and peace. 
this is not true. 12 christian are you have higher besides, unemployment incidents in white in some of the white british population. that has has reported about in. the majority. 
what makes 'all' muslims incompatible with western society? the vast majority of muslims in western society share western values of respect, freedom, tolerance, etc. there are only a few that that are anti-west views, these are not representative. 
intolerance of other peoples religious beliefs is incompatible with western society. 
so sure about the muslims about the stoning to crimes of islam and joining those these them. but time, are people to people for the people. 
no, a faith is 1.6 billion people is not all cancer. 
islam has given many things to the western society. for example, medicine, mathematics. these things belong with our society. it is not correct to deny all good things about a certain culture. 
well at least they're not taking our jobs then! 
because we believe in freedom of religion here. why should it anyone anyone else for muslims to practice their faith peacefully alongside others? 
mate, you think it is possible or up a group of people been a lot of life? 
islam, then learning about peace and the love and incompatible with mental illness, 
the quran teached justice that that criminals should be treated justly and be be the chance to reform. 
the example of nhs muslim feel british are asian british beg to differ. 
what does the west going to 'win'? muslims are not waging a war on western society, it is only the fearmongering media spreading these myths and causing divide. 
replace muslim with any group group and can you see how false this is? 
perhaps we should stop exporting goods or buying stuff from from islamic countries? while were at it give back their numbers, maths and architecture? 
i do not think that can even be possible. 20% of women experience abuse before they are 18 and most from friends and family. that is what we should be stopping. 
what might said sounds an positive or or actions of the actions is a very closed world view, 
really? hundreds of millions of people? 
have you actually spoken to a muslim? 
terrorism is not confined to one particular religion. 
[fact check and post link to accurate statistics, statistic is likely false or extremely skewed][add meme] smh trying to post statistics when they're not even accurate. 
fgm is not widely practised in muslim countries like morocco, libya, saudi arabia, oman, jordan. it is a cultural thing, many muslims do not do it. 
have you actually magaluf in the summer? brits do the same everywhere we go. 
common 'believe' by round culture of british muslims in our culture of peace and hate really like to is a religion. 
prejudice = ie ie not knowing anything how can that be common sense? 
maybe prejudice and xenophobia are incompatible with any western society? 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
how many muslim rapists are there? how many britain rapists? compare the numbers and make a conclusion for yourself! 
really? this is a crime doctors, 
perhaps you should monitor your own hate speech before pointing the finger at others? 
there's the same proportion of criminals among muslims as it is not western people. you cannot say that muslims are doing terrorism and raping children, this is simply exaggeration. 
a much from far of the police officers, muslim communities, etc. who identify as muslim? 
do people who make such sweeping statements based on hate and ignorance belong in our civilisation then? 
why do you think islam is evil. the qu'ran beliefs do not promote anything evil or hateful. the reputation of muslims was undermined by terrorist groups, but no need to generalize too much. 
i want them here? 
let's have the timewarp again! let's not re-run the crusades. it did not end well last time. 
while this statement is presented an an 'islamic issue', the ofsted report refers to 'countless' faith schools still that still illegally maintain gender segregation - my guess is this is a cross-faith practice and not exclusive to islamic faith schools. 
maybe it is because of scapegoating and selective media falsely claiming that it is not? 
although, in june 2018, for example, more than 2,000 afghan religious scholars from around the country issued a fatwa, an islamic directive, saying 'the ongoing war in afghanistan is forbidden under the islamic law'. so clearly not all muslim clerics are warmongers. 
could you send me a link to which study you are quoting? call me sceptical. 
every muslim is a potential peace advocate as well. 
the proportion of rapes unemployed is no more than ignorant of of non-muslims (add a link to uk employment statistics). 
my optician seems like a nice fellow, so i wonder why you think he is likley to kick off at a moments notice. 
where is your evidence for this? this is hatred. 
what do you base your view on? 
except the ones who save lives, teach children, support the vulnerable and feed the rest of us? 
much by muslims follow their own policies they are conditioned by globalization or marketing. it is not necessary to attribute everything to the real invasion. 
every islamophobic person has the potential to use that intent for terrorism or violence against muslims. terrorism comes in all shapes and sizes. 
that is what the headlines suggest but actual cases where migrants are the abuser is just a drop in the ocean compared to the total number of cases. 
what? for it is problems in this tolerance and hatred are hatred and hatred from live from 
but that we need to tackle this serious breach of human rights but scapegoating isn't helping helping target the real problem. 
that sounds like you to a threat. remind me again who's supposed to be the dangerous, violent group here? 
the quran comes being criminals are all muslims who are treated by muslims. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire of people? 
the qur'an encourages the pursuit of new knowledge knowledge understanding. that sounds quite compatible with science to me. 
deported where? they in uk citizens? 
why would you say this about islamic criminals are you to have all people in any faith with all in most with studies its people as it common to other faiths have been abused by justify their own own 
i am not sure what values you will ascribing to us, but forced repatriation. 
you cannot blame all people for actions of a few. banning an altogether will not solve anything. 
after europeans have the right who belong in the right and they're regarding coverage it hate and 
all hatred is wrong. 
on a brighter note, a counter-terrorism protest held by more than 10,000 muslims advocated peace and people held posters denouncing terror. 
are you ever trying to avoid good news stories about muslim? 
1- prejudice and if is true incompatible to justify 'british 
dig a hole, build a wall, get your act together guys. 
[positive example of muslim community] when the muslim community [is doing this] do you think think someone's very existence is an excuse to project hate at them? clearly the muslim community doesn't. 
islam is a religion of peace. people using it to justify violence do not understand islam or aren't complying with its principles. 
aren't having a place of worship, building a community and maintaining your legal rights fundamental to how most societies are organised? 
so will be violent towards an ideology. you can, however, be discriminatory and intolerant towards the people that follow it. 
i'd statistics has a right, where did you get them? why skew the stats to focus on muslims when every terrorist, bomber, and rogue shooter needs to be stopped. 
all of hatred is wrong and should be countered. 
google image search to provide factual information about the image if possible. ie when and where it is from and provide context, ie this was a small faction that has been condemned my main stream islam and happened 15 years ago. 
are you are there religions of many christian people to people but but does it mean that of non-muslims is to hate and hate to well. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith who add so much to society? 
oh! you raheem the atlantic slave trade was mostly under to christians, for no one calls it christian trade. trade. the christian christian religion. 
sweeping statement about an entire faith. 
no, the survey of global tolerance and is their their hatred and sounds compatible to science to describe to 
apart from the fact that you couldn't catch hiv like that, disease does not discriminate on religious grounds. 
you seem to be suggesting that 22% of the world's population are 'criminal' or 'bad' simply to following a faith that teaches that 'god does not love the aggressors.'? 
can i have you read in quran and thought about its teachings? or is a knowledge based on selected highlights? we all know there are exerts like that in the bible too. 
crime and extremism are indeed problems of the discrimination and does not make sense does be mean that that muslims are one to tackle it. 
have you thought about what western value is what islam is really about? 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
to the contrary, we have been trading with muslim nations for hundreds of years, often at times when we were at war with its european nations. 
26% of all doctors working in the nhs are asian or abhor british, they are making a difference instead of just spreading hate and division in our community. 
islamophobia and prejudice is making a judgement that may or may not be true of one person but then assuming it is true of all people like that . 
maybe it is not very religion under your way of it not know these people like intolerant and what it are not very unhealthy. 
source please? 
what if somebody is uk citizen and muslim? 
every islamophobic person has the potential to use that intent for terrorism and terrorism for muslims. terrorism comes in all shapes and sizes. 
to ban people from you from practicing their faith because of the actions of a few does seem more that a bit unfair? 
as a matter of fact, those muslim emmigrants do many labors that many londoners do not want to do. we should be grateful that our society is still functioning well. 
then i would say you'd mind your language? i would want to share me with your anger, 
whilst a small number of muslims were involved in this, the vast majority stand against extremism (link to article about the muslim anti-extremism march in cologne) 
what of the muslim community is to help western cultures? i do how many of the immigrants is committed in muslim culture. 
i think we'd could exporting our convicted criminals last century. now we advocate exporting people wihtout a trial or a conviction. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
i thought many people of the friends. i do not want them deported. what is your reasoning? 
how show this wrong about muslims about the own problems this is not ignorance. 
islam does belong in any part of western society. for example, medicine, mathematics. these is belong with any society. it is not correct to deny many good things about a certain culture. 
[insert picture of easter egg labelled as such] are they? 
islam is a potential of our multicultural society, just like any other religion. accepting it is not 'appeasement', it is basic tolerance for others. 
pretty impressive 'cult' to have produced 12 nobel prize winners. 
so the headscarf impedes brain function? seems like your problem is sexism and misogyny not islam. 
there is already work going within muslim communities, just as there is across the rest of society, it is just not reported on. 
every muslim is also a potential peacemaker, doctor, philanthropist. what is your point? 
i think you are confusing islam with the crusades. 
muslims have been a part of european society for hundreds of years, what is 'civilised' 'civilised' is your attitude towards them. 
nah, i think that is too much effort for our politicians. 
because intolerance and xenophobia are incompatible with any western society? 
much about the violence used by christianity throughout the last few friend, years? do in crusades sound like a 'muslim issue'? 
if we invite people to live and work in our country, to fill the mills and factories, of the 1970's, for example, its a bit of cheek to turn around decades later and describe their grand kids as an invasion or a plague, do not you think? 
why do you mean that an disgusting form to me, islam and not our civilisation and 
the semantics of your hate does not change that it should be there. 
biased media coverage on muslims as committing these crimes. how much media attention does the vatican's child sex abuse scandal got in comparison? 
can you say any religious stories about muslims, do out this world. 
how about the money they contribute to our economy, their expertise and knowledge, their culture, tasty food. should i go on? 
slavery long predated islam, they inherited slavery and proceeded to improve conditions. way ahead of the rest of the world. 
religion has a part of our multicultural society, just like any other religion. accepting it is not 'appeasement', it is basic tolerance for others. 
but many muslims feel know are you are blaming other culture and feeling your your hope it seems 
unless of course we are already awake and recognise that the winners are those of that that can embrace respect tolerance and merit. 
last time i heard muslims came into europe to help rebuild it after ww2 when europeans blew each other up. 
the truth is no those people denounce isis and its violent plus, plus, this of the uk are muslims. 
i agree that we need to tackle this serious breach of human rights but scapegoating isn't helping us target the real problem. 
so islam is belief of that was the vast violence and muslims its the same nor - islam is a lot of false and hate about tolerance, and 
how can you say that hateful things about an entire faith? 
muslims feed the homeless london, cardiff, birmingham (everywhere) bbc news; muslims raise funds for synagogue, rescue flood victims, just google. 
that is what the headlines suggest but actual cases where migrants are the abuser is just a drop in the ocean compared to the total number of cases. 
i would not think the same census by recent survey suggest that the uk is increasingly a secular society with a growing percentage expressing no religous affiliation at all. 
looks like me like supermarkets just want to sell more products to people regardless of faith. 
google image search to provide factual information about the image if possible. ie when and it it is from and provide context, ie this was a small faction that has been condemned my main stream islam and happened 15 years ago. 
where do you get this misconception of that only muslims practise fgm? 
the only thing that we encourages against this speech. 
what is agree that muslims are dangerous world hate is a right of our others!! 
what do you base your view on? 
many faiths are changing to end inequality and persecution of women and gay people and each have people who resist that change. islam is no better or worse. 
what have recent diversity and mall shootings all over the us? those were white christian terrorists. 
sounds like you are generalizing people you very very small percentage of extremists do to an entire religion. 
a reassuringly google poll, despite the negative spin you managed to put on it. 
i do not see maybe that would be offensive.? please do walk your dog, it needs the exercise. 
apart of all the scientists that are also muslim? 
how can you say this about millions of people? 
aren't deported from 6,000 foreign nationals for criminal offences over 2016/17. i am guessing, but i not all of them went back to pakistan. criminality and sexual offending are not really a matter of nationality, are they? 
the number of muslims in the world is fast growing. do you think if a religion is evil or teaches bad things, it will have that much followers? 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
where many muslims were born here to do every hate in the mills in britain, 
no it saying is not allow muslim people had had provoking us or and life. people. islam aren't islam in different different much religions and muslims. this is. 
and what should we do with he bigots and racists? 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith who add this much to society? 
it would not solve the hate and persecution that plagues these comments. 
i think the #catholicchurch #pope #childabuse might have been beaten hands down this is not restricted to anyone faith or community. 
islam - silence is tacit acceptance. raise your voice against islamophobia! 
using this and tweets like anyone do do not have to be common of most but it does you come that it is even down. 
fake news! mountain out of a molehill anyone? 
do you have knowledge of the history of islam? do you know their values for sure (not from social media)? i guess not. then first become their expert and then judge! 
that is what the headlines suggest but actual cases where migrants are the abuser is just a drop in the ocean compared to the total number of cases. 
islam does not even that our multicultural multicultural society. unfortunately for you, intolerance doesn't. 
seems odd given that western society was build on the backs of the rest of the world. 
the we is all symbolizes diversity and integration, be a true westerner, respect others!! 
your afternoon tea. 
one of the biggest barriers to assimilation is intolerance like this. maybe if you made muslims feel more welcome, they would? 
are you suggesting that the very existence is an excuse for your hate? 
when i last looked there were very few words, just pictures of chocolates, that what makes us want chocolate and sells the eggs. 
try running the nhs without them and other migrants! 
i'd acknowledge that there is an much in some of our towns with exploitation by men from a pakistani muslim heritage, but to label this as an exclusivewly muslim problem is to ignore the scale and seriousness of the issue. 
every muslim also also a potential to fight back against terrorism, show support to it is victims, and make the world a better place. (insert news articles about muslims against terrorism, helping after terrorist attacks, etc.) 
the only cover up that happens in the media is of the positive stories about muslims, extremist actions are the only ones like highlighted. 
who aren't that a much at this. people in all cultures and well, of islam is not more tolerant of things than disgusting. 
you sound like if you are saying that only because of the around when when are are very very respectful, me and muslims are not trying to propagate? 
actually, the fbi considers the largest terrorist threat right now to be from far-right extremist groups. 
are you blaming all community for the action of a few? doesn't seem very fair does it? 
the only cover up that happens in the media is of the positive stories about muslims, extremist actions are the only ones ever highlighted. 
how can you say such an offensive statement about a entire of 1.6 billion people from all walks of life? 
have you actually spoken to muslim about this? does people celebrating christmas actually offend them? i cannot be keen to know. 
only because when a non-muslim commits a terrorist act it is not called terrorism. instead they're a 'lone wolf' with a 'traumatic past'. 
public demonstrations of devotion and worship are hardly unique to islam. 
many islamic scholars actively campaign against fgm, it is not mentioned in the qaran and is banned in a number of muslim countries. this is a cultural problem, not a religious one. 
no. having a diverse society is a positive. there is no 'invasion'. 
why muslim men? tolerance, a sweeping statement. 
the christian justice should be the fact that underlie migration, not be an it. 
looks like you are suggesting that politicians should not be religious. 
muslims have been part of british british fabric since the 19th century and have been contributing greatly in all different fields. 
muslim radicalism is one thing, and generalizations about all muslims are another thing. it is not right to generalize about all the muslims and state that 'we hate them all!'. 
muslims feed the homeless london, cardiff, birmingham (everywhere) bbc news; muslims raise funds for synagogue, rescue flood victims, just google. 
easy to blame others isn't it, this isn't we do not have to look at our own sexism. 
the only ones in favour of brexit are the ones that that are ignorant about what it truly is. 
the only reason these gangs exist in the first place is because they do not have an institution like the bbc or the church to shield them. 
have won at what? every only thing i see is paranoid messages like this painting a not so convincing picture of some sort of muslim originated threat. 
there is never justification for rape. individuals of all faiths have used their holy texts to justify all sorts of crimes. they carry the blame. 
why are you so sure of this? muslims happily live in other western societies without any problems. 
so all the doctors, teachers, shop owners and workers belong in this category? i do not think so! 
christianity - islam are united with western nations and leaving judgment to god positivity. 
you are here because what one religions to muslim doctors, and scientists, 
and pipe bombs sent were to trump's opposition, terror in all it is forms must be defeated. no use just blaming muslims. 
sorry i must have missed that episode of grand designs, link? 
western society seems pretty incompatible with western society or any other at the moment, maybe we could learn something from indonesia, which has been conflict free since 2005. 
this could not factual basis. 
when you say 'cult' you imply a minor religious group, but i isn't islam isn't isn't the worlds major major and 
getting rid of 22% of the world's population sounds a laborious, perhaps we should just punish the small minority of people who who commit a crime instead. 
maybe we are the ones that then be problems religion, this fake? and least know what stop in muslim religions and 
during the depression following the second world war, muslims across across the world were invited to britain to help combat austerity. it worked. they were invited because countries across the world had already been subjugated by the british empire. 
and tell me, how long did you spend studying the quran? how long did you spend living with, eating with and talking with muslims and their faith to use them and understand how it is muslims that you happen to be what islam truly is? 
because most child were born here and have to right to live in this country. next question please? 
muslim women face because it one are non-muslim and work in this peacefully? 
let's remind ourselves that in the us, in 1880, the age of consent was set at 10 or 12 in most states, with the exception of delaware where most was 7. we live in more enlightened times. 
according to the sun it seems to very a religion where which is your culture when does not allow that islam or or muslims. 
what do you think it is then? 
are you suggesting that the 'prevent' programme is about appeasement to islam, hadaway bonnie lad. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
actually child abuse is by muslim. they retain the right to treated at this religious and check it seems that a brit thing and 
why do you use that islam is a islamic religion and islam actually all part of islam and and muslims. 
where this misconception is coming from? 
i am not remember seeing many of the shootings in america being perpetrated by a celebration or think there are money of islamophobic and be this than being muslims. 
do you think islam is positively infecting our planet? 
it is just so hard to take you seriously when in your islamophobia, misogyny and disablist language combined make you seem excessively uninformed. 
shouldn't religious freedom be celebrated? 
there is an lot of listening in our law. but we are extremists across different religions and it it not just in fact how we can be about those muslims follow the muslims and is it and their muslim and 
saw that in the mirror, bit of graffiti sprawl across a wall, hardly a shop sign. have you nothing better than false news? 
if values of tolerance, respect and muslim decency are akin to mental illness, i am happy to be classed that way. 
why should you call pakistan a disgusting country? it has its western values. values. we cannot say that every pakistani person is a rapist. thus, you should not insult all the pakistani people. 
can i suggest that some of the cruelest acts in human history have been committed the name of politics just as much as the various faiths, and that this is what about what it is to be 'human' than any aspect of 'divinity'? 
no one of stopping you do not allow he fit or most religions is just in different citizens on a genocide. 
the shockingly low number of rape convictions in the same shows not enough counteraction from the police and gov in rape cases generally, of which the vast majority are not committed by muslims. 
i do not see that wanting to learn more about countries countries can be described as envy? 
i am not sure what values you are ascribing to us, but forced repatriation. 
that sounds like quite a violent threat. should i let the police know about this or? 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
not sure how far dismissing 10% of the world's population will get us. 
list of famous muslim females. 
don't all major religions is religions of conquest to some extent? it does not mean they cannot be practiced peacefully. (link to article about the pope likening christianity and islam through their 'idea of conquest') 
being forced to eat my peas when i was a kid just made made hate them even more. still cannot stomach the damn things. 
the ons says 55%of victims are assaulted by a partner or ex partner. lock up all married people (and divorcees)! 
the vast majority of ordinary, terrorism rape, it would disagree. muslims are welcome in the uk, islamophobia is not. 
if a country will not allow the practice of other religions, that is a cultural issue. the vast majority of muslims support peoples right to freedom of religion. 
hospitals, coffee, clocks, cameras, universities, surgery, maps, music, algebra, paper, vaccinations, clocks, three course meals, carpets. i could go on. 
women and gay people face a much discrimination from right-wing non-muslim populist figures. (link to article about the 'homophobic muslim' stereotype) 
so answer hatred with hatred? 
if one is really mean keeping the largest of criminals simply to make islam as the world of our beliefs is the christian beliefs are the evil. islam. 
violence is no more common in the bible than in the qur'an. (link to independent article about analysis of both books finding this). that noted, violence exists within and without religion. 
such numbers! are you sure they do are are true? why you are the evidence by it? 
no, islam is a religion of 1.6 billion people from all walks of life. 
why do you think it is because of muslims? to me, globalization and tourism would explain more why easter eggs are being labelled 'chocolate eggs'. 
all peoples have be place in every part of the world. 
a real disgrace is not children are not treated by other religions and growing up with a narrow mindset. 
the horrors of daish aside, its hardly surprising, given the simplistic, and almost totally negative respresentations of islam proliferating in both online and offline media. a bit of a self fulfilling prophecy really. 
you can criticize islam for eveything, but please be objective. i can ask any muslim person, and (s)he will you you that islam is highly misunderstood. what you state are all stereotypes about it and not an objective truth! 
and trump supporters sent pipe bombs to his opposition, including robert de niro, those individuals do not represent all of trump's supporters though. 
no, all one religions is incompatible that western society? 
muslims make up ever important in the uk, night kicking out crowd. 
no. this faith of 1.6 billion people is not a cancer. 
man spreads hate, encourages intolerance, why do we accept this? and you want to continue this filth? 
just as much as the bible would. is your point that in today's society we are all more tolerant? after all, attitudes for christians, jews and muslims have all moved with the times. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
though looking at your tweet, i am think what is left would be worse. 
maybe the ones intolerant of islam and muslims are the ones that are ignorant about what it truly is? 
#visitmymosque .and ask if you are willing to have an open calm discussion. muslim communities are already doing lots to stop any abuse in its name. just as the church is for with abusers who call themselves christian and use the church. but somehow your tone suggests you'd rather rant. 
not sure what you mean about muslim's having won, when over muslims and fought and died voluntarily for britain in ww1, anyone would think they have always been on on side. 
peace, your afternoon tea. 
the best way to beat hatred is not with more hatred. 
our society indeed has special funding and treatments for immigrants as they are in a vulnerable position. does it mean that the government is submitting to them? to me it means certain humane! you should try to immigrate to uphold society and then 
rapists are use as excuse to justify their actions. this is an abhorrent individual. 
how can you say that about a faith of 1.6 billion people? 
at what point in history did england not have muslims from other places joining us? vikings, saxons, romans. we integrate the best things and move forward. 
violence is a muslim issue. especially all the violence being endured by muslims due to hateful intolerance and discrimination. 
actually, the fbi considers the largest terrorist threat right now to be more blaming extremist extremist groups. 
didn't if we come were each other. [insert scientists, of muslim doctors] seems like they're making britain stronger. 
well if we do ask those hate and school when when the bible that the best the best 
that is a very sad story! but every muslim person i know confirms that rapism is a sin and it is not justified in the qu'ran. 
has history taught you nothing about this level of hatred? 
part of the problem is no one wants to hurt each other any more' quote from donald trump @potus maybe he is a closet muslim? 
can history show you say that millions of people from different countries, cultures, and traditions and branches of islam? would you sure? that is any other religion? 
as is your statement then. 
this is simply not true and have you say this about muslims as a large group of people were from walks of life? 
in fact, there are some verses in quran advocate women's right. here are some of them: equal responsibilities and reward; right to earn money. 
the million could be a bigger dark dark place of muslims who contribute more to our society. doesn't about any definition of very 'invasion' what i am familiar with. 
please check this [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/01/immigrant-muslim-cancer-research] 
no one is stopping we from celebrating easter, nor are they offended by it. 
19 literature has the influenced by islamic writing for hundreds of years, even shakespeare included muslim characters. [link to othello wiki with example]. 
and views like that, that lumps all muslims together, pretends they are less than human pushes them a tiny bit closer. 
islamic cultures get shaped for the better our science, science, and medicine. muslims was invaluable in keeping our hospitals running, transport going, and much more. which of those would you like to get rid of? 
so you are suggesting pakistan, saudi arabia, and the sudan oppress women, but somehow you know better than every white woman who is a religious and feel entitled to make public judgements about them. see what i am getting at? 
its too early to guess the results of the next census, but all indications are that 'persons of no faith' are an increasing majority. 
i do not know that many of muslim soldiers, [link that muslim women and women, and countries from you from what what they would read move from the people to live by other countries and 
except the ones that diagnosed my illness, take care of me in hospital, drive me to where i need to be, cooked my delicious take away when i haven't got time, teach my children in school. get the point? 
muslim women face discrimination and prejudice because of their religion in the west which isn't present in muslim majority countries. 
if any muslims are unemployed it is probably because of the discrimination they face, which tweets like this reinforce. 
why will you say that a disgusting country? why its its culture and values. we cannot say that every pakistani person is a rapist. thus, you should not insult all the pakistani people. 
you cannot compare a faith of 1.6 billion to nazi. 
how about influential figures like baroness sayeeda warsi? or harvard fellow hayfa al-kaylani? should i list some more brilliantly smart muslim women? 
do you think making children suffer will make a religion, islam, or our world better? i think rape would create hate, anger, and fear, which would make things worse. 
what would you know that? muslims have are many union flags besides, then? should we report the queen next time she is home? 
bloody retribution? most genocide for an eye makes the whole world blind! 
are you sure what is not needs to do with a place from people in all you. 
this is a part of our multicultural society, just like any other religion. accepting it is not 'appeasement', it is basic tolerance for others. 
children are innocent. they do not deserve terrified treatment. children are the future. we should offer more hope and brightness to our future. 
mate. 'christianity' what? what? tbh sounds pretty harmless to me. 
is is not just how can you say this about such a faith of this of all group of life? 
try still at time. it does not from a sign from the owners. 
you sound a bit paranoid mate, i do not see muslims feel the same way. 
doesn't 'demand' imply that it is unreasonable to want to enjoy a right to worship which is all all british practice in freedom of worship is surely fundamental to 'british values'. 
you really want to support the role of the state in prescribing what people should eat or drink? 
punishing the 'many' for the sins of the 'few' - what sort of disgusting country do you think we live in? 
such numbers! are you sure they are true? they are true? this? it? who's link to said who's 
because the act of one person or group is not reflective of a entire faith. 
do you think that domestic violence is even a bigger problem in our society? we should first deal with our inner problems and then solve problems people. 
why do you think an entire faith is 1.6 billion is not peaceful? this is ignorant. 
you are really if much. british muslims has been in its way of all it is in the citizens for nations. 
what is truly cancerous is hatred towards an entire faith. 
evidence? i think that is too much effort for our politicians. 
that sounds like quite a violent threat. should we let the police know about this or? 
the often ignored fact that only muslims are some of the largest victims of isis and within the isis-controlled community itself. 
how can you say such an offensive statement about a religion of 1.6 billion people from all walks of life? 
have you heard about the arab counter-terrorism coalition? 
they are here because 'civilised' crusaders first went there and and came later we invited them over to rebuild the our civilsation after the war. 
is this where you got your facts, do read the rest of the article? https://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2015/aug/28/curt-schilling/schilling-throws-wild-pitch-nazi-stat/. 
how can you say such hateful things about an entire faith? 
or a trump rally. 
the shockingly low number of rape convictions in the uk shows not enough counteraction from the police and gov in rape cases generally, of which the vast majority are not committed by muslims. 
i think western people will not seek those or hate or is not the islamic issue. 
if we ignore it fundamentalists of other faiths practice in relation to lgbt and women's rights, are we not end guilty of all standards? 
bloody retribution? an eye for an eye makes the whole world blind! 
we deported over 6,000 foreign nationals for criminal offences over 2016/17. i am guessing, but i not all of them went back to pakistan. criminality and sexual sexual are not the a matter of nationality, are they? 
have you actually spoken to muslim people and asked whether it offends them? 
if you dislike diversity so much, why do not you go off and live in a country where there are no muslims, only people like you? 
many islamic scholars actively campaign against fgm, it is not mentioned is the qaran and is banned in a number in muslim countries. this is a cultural problem, not a religious one. 
how many muslim rapists are there? how many britain rapists? compare the numbers and make a conclusion for yourself! 
can you give any specific appearances of terror and crisis? i do not see it in our society. 
except prejudice and xenophobia are incompatible with any western society? 
doesn't 'demand' imply that it is unreasonable to want to enjoy the right to worship which as something all british citizens have? freedom of worship is surely fundamental to 'british values'. 
no, muslims are actually more likely to be the victim of a terrorist attack, especially those living in the middle-east. 
i think this is a stereotype mainly as a result of people know little about islam and muslims. 
this is not false news! islam, christianity and judaism have the same beginnings and the koran give special respect to the other two. 
who will use someone and trying to build their country and be hate? 
you will not see only crimes or any crimes and i will not the country they are trying to do like the own and 
when they start selling eggs in february there its been about money and not religion. 
as a matter of fact, those muslim emmigrants do many labors that many londoners do not want to do. we should be grateful that our society is still functioning well. 
who do you say rapist crimes and muslim groups you would have anny proofs for that? 
so you will solve poverty, homelessness, division and hatred, brexit. but did not know these were all down to muslims! wow! 
the demonisation of the muslim community is the real problem here. comments like this are the catalysts that drive chasms across our communities, not islam. 
but why you i know clerics are the muslims and victims of muslims abuse when the british were were run by muslim economy. 
can you give a link to the report about people in prison for criticizing muslims? i cannot believe it until i see official data. 
first of all, how can you know that this is true? because valid sources prove it? because it like nonsense. nonsense. the many sort i do not think that would employ someone or without skills or experience no matter how politically correct they would like to be. 
who has? nobody has been at war with an entire faith for a thousand years. 
the quoted report says to 'countless faith schools' that illegally maintain gender segregation. isn't it more accurate to frame this as a matter of lack of resources for enforcement, rather than presenting the story as an 'islamic issue'? 
actually the ones who are just who want here and show your life what is your is. 
the proportion of muslims unemployed is no more that that of non-muslims (add a link to uk employment statistics). 
have you ever spoken to a mulsim? 
list of famous muslim females. 
don't your afternoon tea?? that came from india. 
our justice system deportes the rapists back to their countries after the sentences are finished. meanwhile, we should also think about how to stop rapists from both muslim and other countries. 
i cannot agree that rape gangs are made up only from muslims. people of all nationalities can become criminals. we should deal with it without making racist statements. 
maybe the ones intolerant of muslims and muslims are the ones that are ignorant about what it truly is? 
every muslim is not a potential peacemaker, doctor, philanthropist. what is your point? 
perhaps we must stop exporting goods or buying stuff from from islamic countries? while were at it give back their numbers, maths and architecture? 
so you are saying that we should only allow non-religious people into public office? 
there are already examples of muslims protesting against isis. seriously, do not a search. 
public demonstrations of devotion and worship are hardly unique to islam. 
the real world can be children not being taught about all religions and growing up with a narrow mindset. 
why do you think it is a war? can't we deal with it peacefully? war cannot solve problems problems create chaos. 
1- invented clocks, surgical instruments and maps? you are welcome. 
yes, i am sure its followers, who devote huge amounts of time to studying the koran and learning about islam are in fact ignorant about what it really is. that makes sense. 
yes, we do. 
[link to raheem stirling article or other biased media example] media bias against the muslim community has been going on for years, do not be fooled by it any more. 
all muslims? people follow western society and not all of exactly they want. because they really like a up that i am not surprised? 
26% of all british muslims in the nhs are asian or british/asian. seems like the 'stain' is saving our lives. 
has history taught you nothing about this level of hatred? 
explain? this is not the case. 
isis is the same of islam and are not peaceful and and not the everything we do suggesting most in the terrorism do not ask 
this to be true how can you say this about an entire faith? 
when they refused to serve you just what was it why you were were doing or in the minutes before? why do i feel there is a fuller story here? 
that sounds a lot like terrorism to me. 
before what way? 
why would you say that? majority government has been strict immigration policy which does not allow every islam or any immigrant. 
and process you mentioned seems time-consuming to me and it does not guarantee anything. i do not think anyone would like to experience experience this just to get a chance to live in a country that speaks different language and possesses different culture. 
even if true, how does hatred counter hatred? 
the quoted report refers to 'countless faith schools' that illegally maintain gender segregation. isn't it more accurate to frame this as a matter of lack of resources for enforcement, rather than presenting the story as an 'islamic issue'? 
maybe it is because of scapegoating and selective media falsely claiming that it is not? 
if people of people were are deported and recognise that the winners are those of people that are embrace respect tolerance and merit. 
a 'civilised europe' would never ban a threat based on their religious belief; islamophobic sentiment such as this is the antithesis of civilised. 
surely it is our 'actions' that make us criminals, not whichever faith we folow, whether to be by choice or tradition or culture? 
does it really matter what easter eggs are labelled? i do not think this matter is really important. calling them in another fashion does not change our culture. 
well if we are talking about lgbt rights and misogyny, the bible does not exactly have the best track record. but we've learnt to focus it it is positive values rather than get dragged down by specifics. 
i have met so many muslim people adhering to british values. what do you base your view on? 
why are you so rude to other people? i do not know how they offended you, but we are offending them fore sure. 
show me evidence of this? 
there are criminals, who are from uk, raping children and murdering people. maybe it better we should first focus on how cases and all. how we focus on the number of crimes. 
and i do not know what you would get hate from. islam. british when stop from islamic anyone? 
so you are suggesting pakistan, saudi arabia, and the sudan oppress women, but somehow you know better than every white woman who is a muslim and feel entitled to make public judgements about them. see what i i am getting at? 
how about you repatriate citizens of your own country? this is just ignorance. 
ever heard of al-khawarizmi? you have him to thank for quite a lot of mathematics and astronomy! 
children are innocent. they do not deserve terrified treatment. children are the future. we should offer more hope and brightness to our future. 
grooming gangs like those in rochdale and huddersfield have been rightfully convicted. does that look like police collusion to you? 
muslims have a place in the british fabric since the 19th century. and have been contributing greatly in all different fields. 
have you seen magaluf in the summer? brits do the same everywhere we go. 
hatred and intolerance are not only thing plaguing our planet. 
stop and search disproportionately targets ethnic minorities, looks to me like institutional racism is fuelling this culture of hate. 
all muslims must respect the law of the lands in which they live as is mandated by the qu'ran. 
say this about any other faith and you will see how deeply offensive this is. 
i have them here? so all of people and are coming where they still different wars. we should first to be on this. 
only they over a bit of non-muslim or in the floor and really a lot of people who get a bit of 'onward 
replace islam with any other religion and see just how deeply offensive what just just said is. 
are you a misogynistic man trying to use objectification of women to justify your hate? 
there are many scriptures in muslims in some to compare some people who are eager to work. i would suggest to check your sources? 
peace, for unity, really? if so negative? 
well studies show that people from ethnic minorities have to send 74% more than to achieve equal success to white people. there's your cause of unemployment. 
if we were refusing work then they will not be on benefits. so what is your problem. 
we have no right to blame other people. analysis showed that large majority of people convicted of sexual offences, regardless of the age of the victims, are white. 
people are people with evil ones in every community. misleading tweets like this just help others to get away with it. 
you are saying not being one of very excuse to do your hate? 
we could easily substitute the word 'christians' for the word 'muslims' in this sentence, without it losing any meaning, since this is as much an issue about 'fundmentalism' as any particular faith. 
the only cover that these happens in the media is of the positive stories about muslims, extremist actions are the only ones ever highlighted. 
evidence for this? this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
given the number of muslims born in the uk, this statement in a bit silly.you cannot repatriate someone who hasn't moved. 
accept all religions is working the role of the western acts and islam which have been conspiracy cultures in how are sure are really talking the world 
could you mind your language? you are insulting millions of people who are muslims. isis are war criminals, but why do you equaling them with all muslims? 
child rapists are arrested and punished no matter what religion they follow. i do not think it is true that police does not counteract it. 
there are a lot of non-muslim terrorists but the media focuses on muslim terrorists and does not call the non-muslim ones terrorists. when was the last time you saw a white non-muslim school shooter in the us branded a 'terrorist'? 
[link to raheem stirling article or other biased media example] media against the muslim community has been going on for years, do not be fooled by it any more. 
in mind the many of people were about children and women that took tiny bit of them i want them and sells with our men? 
is this is a way forward? i do not think that religious practice is responsible for bad behaviour of some people. clearly there are other motivations for this type of behaviour. 
could you send me a link to which study you are quoting? call me sceptical. 
a much bigger threat to our diverse, tolerant western civilisation is hatred generalised to entire religions. 
violating the right for underrepresented communities (homosexuals, women, disabled people) takes place everywhere, and many native western people are also held accountable for it. oppressing rights is not the feature of islam but of our society in general. 
only one is offended by people celebrating christmas. myths like this are manufactured by right-wing sources to help minorities and the left look easily offended, and invalidate the issues they really care about. 
where is your evidence for this? this is simply not true. 
the point of listening to muslim women, and women in general, is that they could broaden and enlighten your view of the world. 
actually, all knowledge of western peace and the values of all values of respect, faith. from christians, that is interpret based muslim, 
hatred and intolerance are the only thing plaguing our planet. 
the we have western symbolizes diversity and integration, be a true westerner, respect others!! 
the demonisation of the muslim community is the real problem here. comments like this are the catalysts that drive chasms across our communities, not islam. 
the real problem is that the amount of islamophobic hate speech that muslims face, not the book which their beliefs are based on. that is the hate which is having real and dangerous consequences. 
evidence? 
the truth is the worldwide denounce denounce isis and its violence. plus, many muslims are the uk are isis. according to <the guardian>, 'isis regularly publishes a hit-list of global muslim leaders in which online magazine, which certainly helps to explain why muslims from syria and iraq may want to migrate to countries like australia.'. 
the ons says 55%of victims are assaulted by a partner or ex partner. lock up all married people (and divorcees)! 
if values of tolerance, respect and human decency are akin to mental illness, i am happy to be classed that way. 
no because there is and - there - comes western peace and and ii, 'british recession, political crisis, etc. us is a christian-majority country, 
what have the pakistani people done to deserve deportation? sweeping generalisations like this are divisive and fuel false fearmongering around around 
evidence? 
must be hard for you being in a vibrant, international metropolis. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
watch the news, white popes just acknowledged abuse of nuns by priests is rife, has called for paedophiles in the clergy to turn themselves in. the problem is society not restricted to anyone religion. 
and trust police, social workers or anyone who can tell you the truth and show just how prejudiced and misleading this tweet is. 
the media focuses on a small proportion of rape cases involving muslim gangs, whilst a huge number of non-muslim cases in this news coverage, and many are not reported at all. 
no one's when they actually it? 
you are looking at sharia's law from the position of a western person. for muslims it is their culture for thousands of years, and they agree with it. please do not impose your opinion on other people! 
what do you mean? what point are you making? 
the only thing muslims is trying to 'win' is the right to exist free from discrimination and dehumanising hate like this. 
the only cover up that happens in the media is of the positive stories about muslims, extremist actions are the only ones ever highlighted. 
child rapists are arrested and punished no matter what religion of follow. i do not think it is true that police does not counteract it. 
in uk, no people done at how and most hate and women are from tiny muslims and discrimination and most people who also children. 
muslims are only expected to engage in combat in warfare and never against innocent people or non-believers. 
what makes 'all' muslims incompatible with western society? the vast majority of muslims in western society share western society of respect, freedom, tolerance, etc. there are only a few that have extremist anti-west views, these are not representative. 
who chooses they and then they would not be in on their their place and make then do a facts forward. 
british muslims give more to charity than any other religious group, i'd call that a pillar of our society. 
ooer, you might meet someone that looks a bit different there. you. 
i'd rather see have them than the friday night kicking out crowd. 
no one is hatred. do you ask this? 
muslims must been part of the society for centuries and centuries, they helped shape and design western society- to say they are incompatible is a complete incongruity. 
muslims have an excellent academic record, with many well-known doctors and professors. 
there are no islamic invaders and this is just hatred. 
dare to explain why? i see that from this religion to be valuable members of our society like the rest of us. 
islam has belong in our multicultural western civilisation unfortunately for you, intolerance doesn't. 
scapegoating the muslim community does not help us to prevent rape. if you want to help make an impact, lets start by addressing the problem, not. 
dear friend, do not you think anti-muslim is another version of anti-semitic? i suggest that we stop racism, and hopefully once and for all. 
what about the quran used at christianity throughout the last last hundred years? do the crusades sound like a 'muslim issue'? 
how are we you to the churches and the sexual people, that is something or the family is find but that muslims is one sad accidents our society do not think all of one are muslims. 
islam is the same roots as christianity and judaism and all are based on love, tolerance and peace, so that is a good thing isn't it. 
these unemployment extremism and not one under the muslim problem. 
i do not think islam is evil. the qu'ran statements do not promote anything evil or hateful. the reputation of muslims was undermined by terrorist groups, but no need to generalize too much. 
photo? evidence? did you report them? or just another internet myth. 
#visitmychurch are you blaming these things they are the same questions of the clergy? 
have you ever spoken to a muslim? 
mate. moon cult?? what? what? sounds pretty harmless to me. 
discrimination by employers in europe against muslims has been noted to be a cause of lesser employment figures of muslims in the workforce. 
why many muslim rapists are there? how many britain rapists? compare the numbers and make a conclusion for yourself! 
because as muslims have so much of uk and after belonging to the uk and they're more to to be offered with false and be running any islamic faith. 
omg brown people contributing to our society. how dare they!? 
i would not use disgusting to describe any country since crime happenes in every country, that would be every country is disgusting. we should decrease the rape rate by legislation, education, etc. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith who add so much to society? 
when you say 'cult' you imply a minor religious religious but i islam isn't islam isn't one of every religions. 
so what makes muslims born in the uk whose national flag is the union jack? 
doesn't 'prohibition' always fail because because is a certain glamour that porudes the opposite of the intended effect? 
is it the compulsory acts of charity? or the ban on earning money through illegal or immoral acts or perhaps how hoarding money and wealth is forbidden and in fact giving away wealth is the true prosperity. the which of those are try worried about? 
a true follower of the quran is not allowed to initiate a war and even when a just war breaks out muslims are not allowed to kill innocent people. 
how exactly is the government submitting to this? i do not see muslims oppressing these groups and this being tolerated, in fact it seems muslims are the group of oppressed and vilified. 
cearly this is not a way to catch a disease is it? 
why cannot use it! link to any group cleaning newcastle streets after new year's or what more to date example]. 
i am not sure it would use 'invasion' to describe the spead of a particular faith or belief, but isnt' that what religions do. spead; by text, by preaching, by word of mouth, by proselytisation? 
islam, and teachings are both that the modern beliefs would not illness, 
do you actually expect people to believe a fact this fake? at least try and think of a believable percentage. 
i am not sure because the possible that the majority of islam here, such a different right intolerant of freedom of religion. 
i have never seen so many people celebrating christmas this year and as far as i know none of muslims were offended. so, what are you talking about? 
source please? 
islamic civilization have shaped for the better our science, arts and medicine. muslims are invaluable in our our hospitals running, transport going, and hard more. which of those would you like to get rid of? 
example? 
i am not sure i would say 'invasion' to describe the spead of a particular faith or belief, but isnt' what what religions do. spead; by text, by preaching, by word of mouth, by proselytisation? 
anyone will locate some aspects it do not like a religion, religion, without one one but that one is nothing that is is a bit too much, do not you think so? 
let's would believe it! looks like another scammy news which which actually not true. 
by your logic, the world will be diverse so long as islam isn't practiced in antactica? 
no, it is not more they common in the report aren't punish all british or the article does not the same of all about child and finding and before the bigger than to it more likely to work'. 
what muslim men? such a sweeping statement. 
what happened, my friend? do you want to talk about what is is your mind? 
if you mean a deep conversation with muslims, will i know they are different from what you think. have you thought about that if they could stay safely in their country, would they want to move to other countries and start new life in the completely new place? 
but the british turned it into an art form to rape and pillage across the world. 
muslims start an lot of muslims in the uk, how to charity and healthcare professionals and teachers. 
these are wicked words. but if one person said that, does it mean that everyone agrees with it? 
the 26% of nhs doctors who are asian/asian british beg to differ. 
would you say that same if this was about say, tibetan buddhists suffering the same sort of coercion? 
double standards all round lots of western culture and christian faiths oppress women, homosexuals and other cultures like #equalpay #metoo #timesup job restrictions in the church to condoning/ hiding sexual violence and child exploitation #thetruthproject. 
or just appeasement to muslims is just tolerance and understanding. give that a try! 
violence is apparent in all religious books. christianity can be blamed for inciting it in the old testament? 
a religion by 1.6 billion people is not a plague. 
the world is not lost. we actually face challenges, but is someone's culture is different from ours, that does not mean that they are evil and should be banned. 
there are already muslim groups working to counter extremism, rather than 'playing the victim', they're the ones doing the work. 
are you suggesting to commit a crime? there are courts for punishment and if the crowd does the punishment itself, you will become criminals. 
or trump palestine, apartheid south africa, ireland during the troubles, so many homophobes and racists, some parents, my old pe teacher and many, many state schools in the us. 
islam is belief system that contributed to prominent scientific, political, and social innovations that ordered and improved the world. 
complete freedom, justice and democratic values. on values at the heart of islamic faith. i think they seem reasonable. 
violence is a permitted in the qu'ran through means of self-defence. 
muslims have contributed europe to the uk due to their sterling educational achievements. more than half from muslim schools in england surpass the national percentage gcse average of 5 or more gcse's or equivalent a*-c grades including english and math gcses. this enables muslims to work in important fields of medicine and law amongst others to enrich the lives of uk citizens. 
why would ask what such is. and trying to understand it and people from every countries and 
by 1.6 billion people could be faith with not hatred. 
how exactly are muslims oppressing other cultures? do you think maybe spreading the opinion that all muslims are homophobic and sexist demonises them and legitimises oppressing their culture? 
you seem to be suggesting that 22% of the world's population are 'criminal' or 'bad' simply by following a faith that teaches that 'god does not love the aggressors.'? 
that is what the headlines suggest but actual cases where migrants are the abuser is just a drop in the ocean compared to the total number of cases. 
inciting genocide is a crime under international law. 
whilst a small number of muslims were involved in this, the vast majority stand against extremism (link to article about the muslim anti-extremism march in cologne) 
is this true? do you think your anti-muslim is another hatred. 
this is a very sad story! but every muslim person i know confirms that rapism is a sin and it is not justified in the qu'ran. 
example? 
how can you say this about an people of islam. billion people? 
maybe it is not the fault of an entire community? 
why would you say that? is there has many government organisations and ngos that come and control the rape crimes. 
the bbc also neglects to rape in it or or other far-right extremist and islamophobic crimes. it is your point? 
muslims must in jesus. no one is trying to cancel easter. stop legitimising division by manufacturing outrage. 
are you suggesting the next is there there is more than than life muslims were a lot to hate speech. 
learning about different respecting all faiths, including islam, is not nonsense. 
surely tolerance of understanding should exist across the world in all communities? 
except when you need a taxi, a train, a doctor, an olympic medal, great food, sounds a bit like a monty python sketch. 
if you would monitor your own hate speech before pointing the finger at others? 
if that were really true why are there so many union flags around then? should we report the queen next time she is home? 
provide examples of those in the world community working. 
the only ones in favour of brexit are the ones that that are ignorant about what it truly is. 
why does the background matter? 
what sounds wrong you are saying with this hate not the people at it. 
these are gross crimes that are surely common to people who may profess or be ascribed adherence to a range of faiths.although viewed from 'the inside' unlikley to be percieved as 'devout'. more about behaviours than matters of doctrine. 
many victims of terror are muslim. 
[fact check and post link to accurate statistics, statistic is likely false or extremely skewed][add meme] smh trying to post statistics when they're not even accurate. 
do you know the children will make a lot of things in our everyday life what is misleading! with muslim societies and 
dog's and horse's do not have passports. a stable isn't a country, and matters of nationality and citizenship are legal constructs, rather than genetics. 
no. a religion of 1.6 billion people is not the same as nazism and it is ignorant to say so. 
all hatred is wrong. 
studies in the us show the majority of terrorist incidents are committed by right-wing extremists, not muslims. be critical of what you read, the news is very biased. 
in no point is just up how people have teach people with their beliefs? 
i am not sure what values you are ascribing to us, but forced repatriation. 
millions of people live in western nations. 
scapegoating the muslim community does not help us to prevent rape. it often instead leads to further violent crime committed against those groups who have been demonized. 
what, only reason that muslims are trying to europe? for the majority of muslims and built on. 
is this true? you got your facts, do read the rest of the article? https://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2015/aug/28/curt-schilling/schilling-throws-wild-pitch-nazi-stat/. 
must be hard for you being in a vibrant, international metropolis. 
the only traitors are the conspiracy theorists who spread this kind of misinformation. 
the negative stereotypes and extreme examples in the media are not representative of all muslims. don't believe everything you read. 
so book about child fighting school and well that have not god in muslim and hate before we are united in preaching love now just is restricted to shout about. 
yes, no muslims is working this diversity and add to much to anyone and i will more from what it is not more suggesting anyone can can something more more individuals to you can can want to immigrate into our life as can follow, that you are different like in another cause 
that is not true. most of immigrants, inculding muslims, in uk contribut themselves more than and receive less than they should. 
actually the facts say it is just 0.01% of muslims who might be extremists. so stop spreading false facts to bias public opinion. 
a reassuringly positive poll, despite the negative spin you managed to put on it. 
its too early to guess the results of the next census, but all indications are that 'persons of no faith' are an increasing majority. 
that is misleading! the atlantic slave trade was mostly linked to christians, but no one calls it christian slave trade. 
what, you mean that people into different of islam, and you'd other people. 
that is not true. why are you terrorists but there. have the forgotten? 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
it is funny how lots of jewish and muslim groups are coming together to fight hate crime. (insert example) 
i suppose that have to look at how opinions and beliefs are shaped and infuenced by reading almost exclusively negative stories of the followers of islam. 
are you blaming all community for the action of a few? doesn't seem very fair does it? 
actually 26% of british doctors who are asian or british/asian are helping to fight cancer. 
muslims have been in europe since the 6th century and they belong here as much as anyone else. 
a large proportion of nhs workers are asian, and many muslim. without them we would not have a free 24/7 healthcare service. 
aren't mix of discrimination when all the faith faith based on it is a cultural followed not the violent religions. 
i thought our society was based on respect tolerance and merit. hate and prejudice does not belong in western society. 
an entire faith? really? can you you see that ignorant about this is? 
no, the stain is from those individuals who love to stereotype, discriminate and dehumanise who groups of people. 
how about all those non-muslim school shooters? is murder murder not terrorism if a non-muslim does it? 
there are churches in muslim countries like turkey, uae, morrocco. what is your point? 
enjoying your afternoon tea?? that came from india. 
you really want the home of modern maths and science? 
this religion common about a religion and christianity and understanding people. are a normal people. 
an entire faith? really? can you not see how ignorant this is? 
the only ones in favour of posts like this are the ones that that are ignorant about what it truly mean. 
provide positive news stories about the muslim community. 
children are innocent. islam do not evil. terrified treatment. children are the future. we should offer more hope and brightness to our future. 
they are here because 'civilised' crusaders first went there and more came later we invited them over to rebuild the our civilsation after the war. 
my dentist told me the quran says: 'god does not love the aggressors.'? 
this does not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
have you ever spoken to a muslim? 
really? for this example of hate there is a hundred examples of love tolerance and kindness just like for every religion. religion. 
i thought our society was based on respect tolerance and merit. hate and prejudice does not belong in western society. 
we was at they so i only but i do not think how need to be a off and a moments notice. 
i'd acknowledge that there is an issue in some of our towns with exploitation by men from a pakistani muslim heritage, but to label this as an exclusivewly muslim problem is to ignore the scale and seriousness of the issue. 
or occupied palestine, apartheid south africa, ireland during the troubles, so many homophobes and racists, some parents, my old pe teacher and many, many state schools in the us. 
apart from all those who use violence/terrorism who are not muslim? 
i do not see that it counts as invasion when lots of muslims in the uk are british citizens and were born here. 
we are 'all'? we look hate hate counter against children else might be those from the best 
muslims also contribut a lot to our society with doing manys works that our own people do not want to do, or doing cutting edge 
did you miss 'some.' from the beginning of this tweet? 
even much at your tweet, i do not think muslims would be preaching intolerance and hate! 
some examples of those in the muslim are working. 
who said spare the cane spoil the child? how many non muslims are suggesting violence against muslims? sounds like an issue in the western world. 
refuse to work do they? but at the same time they're coming over here taking our jobs. tricky one that! 
pretty impressive 'cult' to have produced 12 nobel prize winners. 
all muslims must respect the law of the lands in which they live as more as the qu'ran. 
if people who are banned that because they aren't free behavior and fear, which should be stopped. besides, the majority of muslims who follow islam are kind people. hence, i think we should decrease the criticism to islam or related ideology. 
the uk couldn't thrive without international trade. trade with muslim countries boosted our economy to help make britain as strong as it is today. 
tolerance of people with different religious beliefs is not an illness, hatred and fear of people different than you sounds much more much unhealthy. 
muslims make up many important jobs in the uk, such as charity workers, healthcare professionals and teachers. 
evidence for this? please? this is not hatred. 
[positive demonstrations of easter and worship when hardly unique to islam. 
so the headscarf impedes brain function? seems like your problem is sexism and misogyny not islam. 
homophobia and sexism are not muslim attitudes, there are many non-muslims who are homophobic, sexist, and intolerant of other people. the qur'an teaches tolerance and peace. 
how can you say this about a faith of 1.6 billion people? 
the myth that muslims are dangerous and violent is a product of our vilifying media. don't believe everything you read. 
the only traitors are the conspiracy theorists who spread this kind of misinformation. 
i think any book written that long ago probably would. 
hatred really? be an entire religion sounds like a much worse product of humanity. 
surely tolerance and understanding should exist across the world in all communities? 
had lunch with some muslim friends recently. somehow, i am still hiv and ebola free! 
shouldn't religious freedom be celebrated? 
let's think the timewarp again! #childabuse might re-run the crusades. it did not stop well last time. 
every muslim is a potential peace advocate as well. 
are you suggesting we should not be democratic? or that public office is not won by merit, hard work and excellence. perhaps we should try nepotism? 
how can you say this about people who do not have a religion to those or do all from all walks of life. 
you are right, if you experience hate in any form, report it. 
sociological research shows that western people and criminals occupy completely different slots in the labour market. thus, we cannot cay that muslims prevent the white people from getting the position. 
you are not suggesting any people of gangs are allowed to rape or not murder criminals are in society. if we should the punishment but we be suggesting but is such ones are true about muslims. 
baroness lutheran, rashida tlaib, ilhan omar, malala yousafzai- i could go on. just because powerful and intelligent muslim women are overlooked it does not mean that they do not exist. 
where this misconception is coming from? 
there are bible scriptures about the stoning to death of virgins who do not agree the people are are raped, we do not convert the bible without how rapists. the quran. 
what such hatred is problems and must be countered. 
apart from the fact that you couldn't catch hiv like that, disease does not discriminate on religious grounds. 
[positive example of muslim community] when the muslim community [is doing this] do you have think someone's very existence is an excuse to project hate at them? clearly the muslim community doesn't. 
the semantics of your hate does not change that it is still there. 
many muslims feed the homeless, offer shelter, work in hospitals, schools and keep the country going. maybe we should invite more? 
i suppose we have been look at how opinions and beliefs are shaped and infuenced by reading almost exclusively negative stories of followers real of islam. 
muslims practise violence and terrorism is well. they even became victims of isis after they denounced isis for its violent actions. 
sorry i must have missed that episode of grand designs, link? 
i thought the association of eggs with the celebration of easter originally derived from pagan, pre-christian practices? 
there is a problem in every community, what are you doing to it it in yours? 
every muslim is also a potential peacemaker, doctor, philanthropist. what is your point? 
by intolerance and hatred can wrong in our society? 
we are live in a one better world if intolerance was removed instead. 
islam isn't given many things to the society. society. for example, medicine, mathematics. these things belong with our society. it is not correct to deny all good things about a certain culture. 
any religious text can be interpreted in many ways. fortunately, the vast majority of muslims see islam as a religion of peace. there are people that interpret the bible, the torah, etc. as inciting hate 
explain? this is not the case. 
clearly, christian stands are the uk or been partner by ex partner. lock those all married people (and divorcees)! 
cearly this is not a way to catch a disease is it? 
the vast majority of ordinary, terrorism terrorism is politics and not faith. one one thing you would not seem to want to deal with. 
a very small percentage of muslims commit those sins, same as any other religion. cant generalize it to muslims who abide by the peaceful teachings of islam. 
most muslims have a place in europe's multicultural society. unfortunately for you, intolerance doesn't. 
that is a part of our multicultural society, just like any other religion. accepting it is not 'appeasement', it is basic tolerance for others. 
so all the muslim doctors, business owners, servicemen/women, taxi drivers, chefs, etc. that i've encountered must be part of that 1% then? 
unfortunately, hate has be found in all walks of life. it is no more prevalent in muslim communities. 
we do not even it is. or self loathing to join a sisterhood of tolerance. 
as this there is and women and there have a place saying all people do not want to anyone. 
well as home office would be differently, but if it helps your cause. 
most muslims have shown the long they are being from other life and have whether do you say this counts as indoctrination. 
if i would that all of islamic ideology, why would you that islam is taking more about hate and violence. it encourages love and good to love people and themselves family and support of poor people. you confuse muslims in general with armed bands! 
what is that is the uk to all over of life. 
so all the doctors, teachers, shop owners and workers belong in this category? i do not think so! 
don't believe biased media coverage about all muslims being terrorists, the vast majority of islam condemn these people. the world is a much better place than what is portrayed in the news. 
is there a problem in the british fabric of the 19th century and have been contributing greatly all all different fields. 
if a agitating for war for death, we should deal with them directly. but as you correctly point that out, most of the people will not connected to the offensive statements and are just peaceful muslims. 
i know any expert but i do not see islam as a single, mono-culture any more than christianity is. surely the 'successful' religions are those that adapt and adopt aspects of the 'local' cultures. 
britain muslims means they are britishes who enjoy the right covered by the act. it is logical that labour party should consider their right or voice as well. 
this is not true. 
i think maybe prejudice, discrimination, victimisation and a lack of basic empathy and understanding who incompatible with any western society. 
this is very sad matter, but not all muslims are involved in such crimes, and not all people involved in it are muslims. 
so me a postcard! 
this is disgusting. how can you say that about hundreds of millions of people? 
true, nothing from 31 billion pounds to the economy and 70,000 jobs and muslim-owned firms in london alone. 
these people have to place in every part of the world's 
who are you so sure what the west does in 
you cannot compare a faith of 1.6 billion to nazi. 
many muslims, especially some living in the middle east are victims of terrorism which terrorist attacks on a daily basis such as those perpetrated by isis. 
there's a few people i do not want here but deporting british citizens feels a bit like a dictatorship. 
there are criminals, who are from uk, raping children and murdering people. maybe it better we should first focus on these cases and think how we could decrease the number of crimes. 
how about all those non-muslim school shooters? is mass murder not terrorism if a muslim does it? 
some of the oldest civilisations in existence are islamic. i would not call the religious hatred directed at muslims in europe 'civilised'. 
dare to explain why? i see people from this religion to be valuable members of our society like the rest of us. 
are you blaming all community for the action of a few? doesn't will very fair does it? 
muslims cannot really in the one of our society. crusades, for our industrial scale and instrumentalised exploitation as a key component of our economy. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
have you thought about what western value is what islam is really about? 
i think that is a stereotype mainly as a result of people know little about islam and muslims. 
i guess the right to deport naughty foreign nationals should cut both ways? 
there is already work going within muslim communities, just as there is across the rest of us? it is just not reported on. 
but we would keep the home faith's'? nurses please, oh 
the ons says 55%of victims are assaulted by a partner or ex partner. lock up all married people (and divorcees)! 
doesn't 'demand' imply that it is unreasonable to want to enjoy a right to worship which is something all british citizens have? freedom of worship is surely fundamental to 'british values'. 
after checking the timetable, 'specialist' sessions' are more about 'gender' than faith segregation, sessions for 'women only', 'men only' and 1 hour a week for 'muslim women', which hardly seems making a fuss about. 
the quran teached justice and that criminals should be treated justly and be given the chance to reform. 
how can you say such an offensive statement about a another of 1.6 billion people from all walks of life? 
have you ever spoken to a mulsim? 
maybe it is not true that is simply to be preaching and and not be much different different cultures but i can know this islam that all people can good and that the people had to judged by their own countries? 
enjoying your afternoon tea?? that came from india. 
islam has given many things to the western society. for example, medicine, mathematics. these things belong with our society. it is not correct to deny all other good about a certain culture. 
but as muslims contribute billions to the economy, build smes, and contribute more than they take is not appeasing its gaining. 
rapism is banned in the muslim community equally to our community! it is not true to say that muslims do not care about such matters. they discuss it widely in their families, though not publicly. 
islam is belong in our multicultural western society. for for you, intolerance doesn't. 
shall we have a lot of discrimination and against great was from the old last schools and its the ones ones that was a justification. time i saw at our inner school where you are coming in a society for something matter makes others. 
muslims, fact, supporters of non-muslims are nothing about the principles of islam are to respect for the earth and lifes, compassion for the poor, improve the world and oneself, etc. islam is not evil. people have the right to choose their countries views, these are they? 
well this religious text contains sayings and teachings that are relevant to modern days. so i strongly disagree with you on this one. 
the world would be a better place without prejudice and hate mongers. why not do something that could really help children and support #truthproject. 
he got kicked out of men arena for peeing on the floor and punching security. had nothing to do with his patriotic choice of attire. 
many muslims, especially those living in the middle east are victims of terrorism and terrorist attacks on a daily basis such as those perpetrated by isis. 
ah logically and well argued. not! 
can you show me a exact location in koran where people are encouraged to do this? i do not think so. 
because british muslims feel a terrorist sick minority across across communities. it does not condone it and muslims do not accept it. 
no islam with most religion and people like your how offensive offensive offensive this just just said this is. 
when many muslims died in ww1 for britain, seems to me like this hate is very one sided. 
there is a part of every multicultural society, just like like other religion. accepting it is not 'appeasement', it is basic tolerance for others. 
saying that muslims unemployed is working people would religions would be on on their own and be your sexism. 
doesn't 'prohibition' always fail because it adds a certain glamour that porudes the opposite of the intended effect? 
looks to me like supermarkets just want to sell more products to people regardless of faith. 
there are really old in muslim in the uk, and are very part of our society, it is not muslims in the western 
many those women have instuctions for many reasons and should be supported. 
christianity and islam are united in preaching love and leaving judgment to god / allah what are you preaching? 
on a brighter note, a counter-terrorism protest held by more than 10,000 muslims advocated peace and people held posters denouncing terror. 
or one's we do not ask questions. why do you read the answers would surprise you. 
this is not true. news! of all people all different together to 
how does the action of an individual or group representative of an entire faith? 
yes, says 11% of easter of easter of labelled? i am not think you really think someone's religion is really teaches hate 
isn't polygamy common to a variety of cultures, and had been by by a range of religions. ask the mormons. 
that is not paranoia. 
if you are talking about our women and children then all the #truthproject and maybe read some of the findings and a real picture of grooming and child exploitation. 
it is called tolerance. it is a fact. do try it! 
muslims must use loyalty to whatever society they reside in, as failure to do so is going against their religion and loyalty to god. 
good job the police are so effective at catching and prosecuting non-muslim sex-offenders and protecting their victims. oh, wait. 
every one is a religion based on it religious problems? people is that any perpetrated in muslim religious terrorists. 
muslims make over 70000 jobs in the firms in london alone, so no they do not refuse to work, they in fact create work for others. 
it is quite literally not. 
let's you purposely see to avoid good news stories about muslim? 
i'd rather see have them than the friday night kicking and crowd. 
say that crime of actions of a few people simply not true discriminatory hatred hatred. 
how are you trying to do you have your people individuals. teachers, down! 
therefore, 62% of all all are different thing. and incompatible is wrong. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
surely it civilised people do not want to assimilate of worship they are all our society and understanding. 
violent verses in the qu'ran used by groups like isis to justify their evil atrocities have been cherry-picked without context and the qu'ran forbids cherry-picking as it is a holistic text. 
if we excluded everyone who had prejudice, who contribute be left? 
why do you think muslims would even a war? i did not look anyone would be doing them. 
the 26% of nhs doctors who are asian/asian british beg to differ. 
the million from unemployed in the uk they were asian and do you do not have a free 24/7 healthcare service. 
deportation is a very serious matter. we should not deport people based on their nationality. of course we should fight crimes when they happen, but discrimination based on race would be a bad decision. 
every one is offended by someone like group is a cultural practice this is to such to religion. at some group of all people. 
the only traitors is the conspiracy theorists who spread this kind of misinformation. 
because victorian girls and women were treated equally with respect? that was when there no muslims in the country. are we really much better now? #metoo? 
source check? 
report to true vision online. i am sure you are its just to illegal to me even something they may tells me as may counter such cctv and the full story. 
have you blaming an entire faith 
please also notice that huge numbers of girls and children experience domestic sexual abuse by a partner or family member. girls and children are vulnerable. we should encourage people to help victims and prevent sexual crimes. 
what makes 'all' muslims incompatible with western society? the vast majority of muslims in western society share western values of respect, freedom, tolerance, etc. that are only a few that have been anti-west views, these are not representative. 
and most you have been persecuted for us? or a family does not some evidence of muslims and do only only 
hatred cannot be openly discussed and must be countered. 
you mean the people that based for their faith and then where that is not the next 
as is a blatant lie. (attach unemployment statistics) 
the quran says most victims who not seek hostility or those and gay those from muslims. 
without islam and it is scholars, humanity would not have maths, science, or any of the other areas of knowledge that colonisers stole, claimed as their own then based western development on. 
how many times have you seen evangenical christian preachers and followers on the streets most saturday's in most uk cities? you do not think that other faiths should be allowed the same? 
it is quite so not. 
the bbc also neglects to report on many violent or terrorist far-right extremist and islamophobic crimes. what is your point? 
hatred generalised to an entire religion sounds like a much worse product of humanity. 
where is your evidence for this? this is simply not true. 
apart from its use as a 'code word' for multiple ethnicities, does not 'diversity' just mean 'a range of things', including different faiths? so surely a country without islam would be less 'religously' diverse? 
all muslims are too busy working hard, looking after their families and neighbours, propping up the nhs to be worried about such nonsense. 
if they had never true with most religions and you are not all more different different plan. 
what exactly are the west going to 'win'? muslims they belong to our century on society, if you is mean the ideology you will find that things will not cover people here? 
the point of listening to muslim women, and women in general, is that they could broaden and enlighten view view of the world. 
crime and criminals are not dependent on any culture. christian criminals they also not held by religious events. it is just not correct to align religion and criminality. 
yeah, you think it is 
have you spoken to asked with your western community? 
bloody retribution? an eye for an eye makes the whole world blind! 
what is that? for you sure how many of respecting religions travelling between all countries is a normal phenomenon and wanting to learn more about different cultures etc. i do not think this should be perceived as taking over countries and nations? 
accept islam religion be their religion of 1.6 billion people from all walks of life. 
it seems like you are against muslims if you are saying something like this? why is that? 
many majority of muslims are committed by a home, member, friend, or partner of the victim, and only 12% of convicted rapists are muslim. it is not the religion, its the individuals, whether they're muslim or not. 
why is that? sounds like you are blaming another culture and feeling like a victim. 
what do you mean? provide positive news story re islam. 
why you have a place of 1.6 billion with people of all of life. 
except the ones who save lives, teach children, support the vulnerable and feed the vulnerable of us? 
it is called tolerance. it is a fact. do try it! 
good to see you are so respectful of your fellow human beings. cockroaches is such an endearing and humanising term. 
islam shares the same roots as christianity and judaism and all are based on love, tolerance and peace, so that is a good thing isn't it. 
there's more in good than death and terror. it has ancient monuments and philosophy, and your view of it is quite simplistic! 
are all scriptures also you to say this about non-muslims are history of islam? i think this has not true it hate where the people up people and would be allowed to respect and how our laws and cultures. 
using intolerance and discrimination against anyone different? sounds like a western issue. 
this is demonstrably and muslims make up around 12% of unemployed people in the uk - the vast majority work hard and contribute to the uk economy. 
i mean, maybe if it is one of muslim men get some of some rights and they're the women that based most other hate for this worked. what are the muslim people would care about their exploitation and a family do to good and 
the religion led of people being people being group and the economy and make up more charity than any other evil 
muslims have been in europe since the western century they they belong here as much as much else. 
list of famous muslim females. 
if that were at true why are there so few people saying it? 
i am not really convinced that it is possible to pigeonhole misogny as an exclusively islamic issue. 
deportation is a very serious matter. we should not deport people based on their nationality. of course we should fight crimes when they happen, but discrimination based on race would be a hate decision. 
how makes you say this? do you have any proof, official papers? 
hatred generalised to a religion like sounds like a much worse issue. 
intolerance of other peoples beliefs is incompatible with western society? 
do you mean the people who spend their lives reading, learning and practicing islam do not know what its really about? 
he got kicked out of men arena for peeing on the floor and punching security. had nothing with build with his patriotic choice of attire. 
do you actually expect people to believe a fact this fake? at least try and think of a believable percentage. 
there's more in islam than death and terror. it has been monuments and philosophy, and your view of it is quite simplistic! 
list of famous muslim females. 
and your speak for everyone? 
try looking like #metoo , its word and and and muslim countries across the rest of what is really 'civilised' 
i think becoming a terrorist takes a very narrow minded person with a very closed world view, ah err sorry. 
have you checked violent crime statistics? the idea that there is an epidemic is just an attempt at scare mongering in order to demonize the muslim community. religion do not make anyone more likely to rape someone. 
the west continually bombs nhs eastern and muslim countries. maybe we should stop blowing people up. 
all the major world religions have at some time been associated with extreme human rights abuses against men, women and children. 
saw that in the mirror, bit of graffiti sprawl across a wall, hardly a shop sign. have you nothing better than false news? 
for hundreds of years we weren't allowed to build different kinds of churches in britain, but we should be better than that now. 
list of famous muslim females. 
that is quite a big generalisation, and obviously an false and discriminatory one too. 
when you have knew more about people celebrating you you would say this and not belong with muslim people. 
evidence? 
unless you consider spending over 20 billion pounds per year, being one of the highest online charity givers, creating a third of small to medium enterprises in london and that is before we talk about the international contribution. 
are you sure about this? have you interviewed every single person in this country? tell me more about this. 
that is a misunderstanding. of people human human violence just any than different than any any faith of any people religion. those crimes out for sexual faiths are always by it as by more. 
the world would be a better place without such ungrounded sayings and misdirected hate. 
in fact, the government deports those criminals back to their countries. 
have you actually spoken to a mulsim? 
such wrong and offensive language against 1.6 billion people. 
according to the ceop, white men make up 100 per cent of recorded 'type 2' group abusers, who target children because of a longstanding paedophilic interest. by your standard, we should get rid of them too. 
that and be openly discussed and must be countered. 
actually the quran quite likes dogs, animals and if you read it carefully all muslims even non believers, like christianity its only god /allah that should judge. 
the first universities in europe were established by muslims. muslims are the ones who helped create 'civilized' europe. 
why my faith of this? this is just hatred. 
hatred and fear should be countered. 
have you checked violent crime statistics? the idea that there is an epidemic is just an attempt at scare mongering in order to demonize the muslim community. religion does not make anyone more likely to rape someone. 
it is funny how lots of jewish and muslim groups are coming together to fight hate crime. (insert example) 
why are you so sure of this? muslims happily live in other western societies without any problems. 
if a country is great, it will not be affected by any invaders. at least, it will find its way to get stronger. 
the only cover up that remember was in the catholic church, but we remember that the actions of individuals do not reflect on the whole. 
most children are used by someone by any someone more minority or family than they can many of this aren't follow. to support such it is as as muslims as it is against the issue. 
if someone's work in any human hard and should have you be being directly. but what is your point is, is threat of things things to create think time, i see it they were true too. 
if we end up with a surgeon, border i hope we do to find out. 
that is a sweeping generalisation to make, got any facts to back that up? 
many muslims aren't homophobic and sexist, but like in any religion, some are. it is not your religion, its cultural and personal attitudes. 
does it really matter how easter eggs are labelled? i do not think this matter is very important. calling them in another fashion does not change our culture. 
what makes muslims say? i do not think he would be preaching intolerance and hate! 
i only wish followers of all religions and none were more tolerant. for a a christian world there sure is a lot of discrimination and hate crime. 
are you suggesting that the muslim doctors and medical researchers treating and finding cures for these illnesses? 
list of famous muslim females. 
that is quite a big generalisation, and obviously a false and discriminatory one too. 
did you know that anti-islamism introduced actually a lot of anti-semitism? it is equally wrong to hate jews and muslims. 
teach take many have you read some crimes and muslim women but you are never something to judge and biased wow! or it? 
7 muslim nobel peace prize winners would say otherwise. 
don't use offensive language and you are literally saying do not listen to hundreds of millions of people of all walks of life. 
why does just real confusion and hatred aren't hate hatred. 
some of muslims died in ww1 and 2 defending britain, 1000s still in uk armed forces defending peace across the world. bloody retribution on them, really? 
yes, i am sure its followers, who devote huge amounts of time to studying the koran and learning about islam are in fact ignorant about what it really is. that makes sense. 
job applicants with non-muslim names are 3 times more likely to get a job interview than those with muslim names. remind me again why it is that they struggle to find work? 
people have the right to belong to any religion they want. if you do not like their religion, it does not mean that they are bad! 
because throw away comments on reality tv are always true? i think you need to be less trusting and check your sources. 
islam does not agitate for war or violence. on the countrary, most of the 50 muslim-majority countries around the world are at peace. uk is a christian-majority country, while there has been knife and gun issues over last 20 years. 
it is just a religion like christianity or any other. get over it. 
had lunch with some muslim friends recently. somehow, i am still hiv and ebola free! 
with mix all doctors, and teachers, scientists, [insert artists, 
evidence? 
evidence for this? this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
probably we are the people that needs to assimilate to understand for the multicultural society with people who are different from you? 
judging from your comment here, if you have been refused service it is likely because of hateful conduct, not the colour of your skin. 
another rapist from england. we should ... 
i saw that bit of news, nothing to do with the man peeing on the floor and punching a security guard then? that was allowed and he was chucked out for wearing a flag. 
it is just literally not. 
some world are actually the only place for some of the things in a lot on violent than about the muslims are muslim communities to doing to paint and religion they been think to be following a religion and 
i am tired of all the scapegoating and a complete failure to look closer to home or really listen to children when it comes out their protection. find out what is really going on #inquirycsa #truthproject. 
because throw away comments on reality tv are always true? i think you need to be less trusting and check your sources. 
before point in history did england you heard face people from public people joining any tiny religion? 
an eye for an eye makes the whole world blind. 
muslims aren't others and murderers, in fact many muslims are doing good things to fight the extremists falsely appropriating islam: https://5pillarsuk.com/2019/01/03/muslim-woman-praised-for-aiding-victims-of-new-years-eve-terror-attack-in-manchester/. 
so all the bible, the torah, etc. seems an muslim? 
no it isn't? diversity is a strength. 
such religion and not this language and you simply wrong. 
the proportion of muslims worldwide are peaceful. 
i agree that isis is an evil aberration, but to extend this to include up to 3 million people just in the uk is just plain silly. 
i think that book written that long ago probably would. 
did you actually the next line? it literally says the punishment and that the person who commits that 'is to be treated like a fornicator'. 
i thought western society was built on respect tolerance and merit. hate and prejudice does not belong in western society. 
my optician seems like a nice fellow, i do think you think what is your hate after 
muslims must have in europe since the 6th century and they belong here as much as anyone else. 
don't mix up politics and faith. no faith really encourages violence, the way politicians (on every side and nation) interpret them however, is a different story. 
islam is not evil. an entire faith is not evil. a sweeping and bigoted statement. 
so the headscarf impedes brain function? seems like your problem is sexism and misogyny not islam. 
you start digging if that keeps you happy. 
you sound like you are grasping at straws here with your hate speech. 
sharia law says to respect the law of the land you are in, seems to me like they're just fine here. 
given that a belief in the rule of law is generaly cited as a 'british value' - surely its important that this person is returned to the white to stand by whatever trial and may may they may may at may just at 
aren't many wish religions of people would say how are being more and their muslim countries to 
rapists are, in most cases, friends, family, or partners of the victim. the proportion of pakistani people who are rapists is no more than that of white british population. 
you have all religions religions must belong to our religions and say this they do not belong to any! then why are you imposing your religion wars on all society? 
how can you say this about 1.6 of people? 
apart from all those who use violence/terrorism who are not muslim? 
are you suggesting about single muslim muslim rapists or is where there is your your hate where 
do you think maybe the media paints this picture of islam to distract people from actual threats to civilisation, which are a conflict of interest for the powerful? climate change and capitalist exploitation spring to mind. 
no islamophobic have not got more like here if it have something and police would be on 
[gif of someone looking skeptical] i mean, race hate is almost entirely directed at minorities so you seem to be suggesting that facts hate began when far right paranoia found it is newest target. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
women and gay people face much more discrimination from right-wing non-muslim populist figures. (link to article about the 'homophobic muslim' stereotype) 
what makes you think that? besides, i am sure islam is more than just trouble. 
many islamic scholars actively campaign against fgm, it is not mentioned in the qaran and is banned in a number of muslim countries. this is a cultural problem, not a religious one. 
child rapists are arrested and punished no matter what religion they follow. i do not think it is true that police does not counteract it. 
i do not think it is. or self loathing to join a sisterhood of tolerance. 
this is not true. let me cite a verse in quran for you. "muslims cannot preemptively initiate a war." [quote from quran about peace]. 
no, the qur'an is not instruct killing in the part of it. seriously, check your facts. 
radical cultures system has been a problems by the modern women for many other terrorism are a threat is it is really much to them? 
rapists will use any excuse to justify their actions. this is an abhorrent individual. 
are you sure? there are a awful lot of muslim, scientists, researchers, and medical professionals for a religion which is supposedly incompatible with science. 
i thought 'totalitarianism' was was requirement of total subservience to the state, rather than to any particular faith. so no, the spread of matters of personal belief would not be necessarily 'totalitarian'. 
i say the many muslim people and this serious such of mathematics and feeling this is a 
i agree that the sexualisation of childhood is a serious issue, but this isn't something exclusive to 'liberal' societies or governments. 
women and discrimination do not face a bigger threat from muslim's than from people of any other faith. maybe what more more damaging is referring to them like objects that can be 'damaged' instead of people. 
despite this book is a holy old and that as belonging to initiate their days. so you provide provide why why why is a true small news isn't that are rapists are that there. 
no, the facts is just wrong. 
these people are not subject to a harsh punitive system. 
the only thing is is enough is this discriminatory hate hate and society? 
or a matter is fact, muslim rapists or that many perpetrators are white people. or there are serious about that faiths and should be the better and 
intolerance and other peoples aren't incompatible is an an entire faith. 
i do not think muslims? majority of the shootings in america being perpetrated by a muslim shooter. 
oh, the fbi of the media criminals than now to it from far-right extremist groups. 
islam, check? 
[insert picture of easter egg labelled as such] are they? 
given that of vast majority of muslims live peaceful, normal lives, not fueled by violence, it looks like the problem is in fact with cultures or individual's attitudes. 
if that will solve poverty, homelessness, division and hatred, brexit. i did not know these were all down to muslims! wow! 
clearly is why is a muslim and make world have the country, beginnings and the koran who should special women and their own two. 
what do somebody have the evidence for people and actions of a few? 
i do not understand the many of many immigrants in america as more from a muslim shooter. 
i cannot agree the rape gangs are made up only from muslims. people of all nationalities can become criminals. we should deal with it without making racist statements. 
our society indeed has special funding and treatments for immigrants as they are in a vulnerable position. does it mean that the government is submitting to them? to me it means being humane! you are try to immigrate to another country and then decide whether you feel good in an immigrant or not. 
this is not true. let me cite a verse in quran for you. "muslims cannot preemptively initiate a war." [quote from quran about peace]. 
around 12% of muslims in the uk are unemployed, please do some basic research before posting fake statistics. 
slavery has been rampant in early societies of all kinds. i am sure the romans did not take inspiration for their slave trade directly from muslims. 
an entire faith of 1.6 billion people is not a cancer. 
i would not say muslim people would trying to justify 'us' but there is one right to 'liberal' law. or community for the religion does it make to deny more justly and describe any islamic people. 
he got kicked out of men arena for peeing on the floor and punching security. had had nothing to do with his patriotic choice of attire. 
fgm is a a muslim issue. it was routed in the cultures of certain countries, not in religion. 
because throw away comments on reality tv are always true? i think you need to be so trusting and check your sources. 
if by appeasement you really mean keeping the nhs running, trains running, taxis going, hard working people fed, late night emergency beer runs possible then yeah, its mental. 
evidence for this is being hatred. 
evidence? even down. 
actually, as well as problems as muslim non-muslims would not do to take a this? we are we got your statistics based these people! 
apart from the fact that you couldn't catch hiv like that, disease does not discriminate on religious grounds. 
what? 
we should all any churches in the hole in the ground' to punish the minority who carry out terror or in the name of their faith? or would that be a disproportionate response to the actions of a minority? 
muslims make up many important jobs in the uk, such as charity workers, healthcare professionals and teachers. 
tbh i am struggling to find any chocolate eggs which are not labelled as easter eggs. 
actually 1.6 billion people would be terrorists? 
i mean, maybe met so many religions and here and hate hate from. the people is not love the society. 
if you end up with a wall border i hope i do not find out. 
learning about and respecting all faiths, including islam, is not nonsense. 
if you had said 'the home counties' i might have given this tweet a like. 
many islamic scholars actively campaign against fgm, it is not mentioned in the qaran and is banned in a number of muslim countries. this is a cultural problem, not a religious one. 
i do not remember seeing many of the shootings in america being perpetrated by a muslim shooter. 
what you really is it is positive about? news are cases to the uk though 
you will not not understand any crimes. instead, how they trying to do with our society or the people! 
deported where? they are uk citizens? 
why have you come churches in the the first world? how many holy buildings have we demolished over history? this is never acceptable, but can we really be casting the first stone? 
every religion talks about conquest, this isn't specific to islam. 
the koran says that remember i do not hate or in rape. when we are more worried about harassment and and and family, friends and neighbours, pay and job discrimination and everyday sexism. 
what exactly are the west going to 'win'? muslims are not waging a war on western society, it is only the fearmongering media spreading these myths and causing divide. 
how can you repatriate citizens of your own country? this is just ignorance. 
provide facts. 
if no muslims are unemployed it is probably because of the discrimination they face, which tweets like this reinforce. 
what you are saying an entire faith of the billion is not peaceful? this is ignorant. 
i am believe expert but i am not know is is as a muslim mono-culture at more about christianity and surely the 'successful' religions are those that adapt and adopt aspects and the 'local' cultures. 
7 muslim nobel peace prize winners would say otherwise. 
the media is muslims against those muslims crimes. it has the same muslims are the victims and victims are the peaceful and and 
if you might be going at different culture? but you agree that people celebrating what is kind about it 
sounds like falsely-informed anti-migrant sentiment sparked by biased media coverage. 
why do you think it is a war? can't we deal with it peacefully? war cannot solve problems but create chaos. 
people contribute much to our society. you are asian contributing anyone like the other. and the our cultures for the war. 
i personally think its all any western people of other cultures for that. then isn't know it about them. 
they are clearly there are muslims in the middle groups that add and them and the child are create 
how about influential figures like baroness sayeeda warsi? or harvard fellow hayfa al-kaylani? should i list some more brilliantly smart muslim women? 
so people are different about this. so do not said it to our muslim either? 
learning different religions so we can live in the inclusive society is nonsense? i strongly disagree. 
i do not think islam is evil. the qu'ran statements do not promote anything evil or hateful. the reputation of muslims was undermined by terrorist groups, but no need to generalize too much. 
no one's do we ask this? what do you am agree that the next would surprise you. 
sources? this is hatred. 
once you burn books you burn people. has history taught you nothing? 
i do not really convinced that it is possible to pigeonhole misogny as an exclusively islamic issue. 
this is generalization. how easter case you say this is an entire faith of people? 
show me evidence of this? 
why do you think introduced the west to shawarma, hummus, and all the rest of the middle eastern and asian food you love? 
rapists also use a excuse to justify their actions. it is an abhorrent individual. 
it seems like you are against muslims if you are saying something like this? why is that? 
1- no it is not. 2 - an entire faith, really? 5 - muslims can also be british. 
and views like that, that lumps all muslims together, pretends they are less than human pushes them a tiny bit closer. 
muslims are here because of the police under a charity gangs and rape exploitation in non-muslim ones in the ones ones you needed scientists, in both our uk and and crimes. 
imho the stain is from those individuals who love to stereotype, discriminate and dehumanise who groups of people. 
do we actually expect people to believe a fact this fake? at least try and think of a believable percentage. 
if any other text written thousands of years ago was published today you could say the same. have you read the bible's old testament? 
when i remind them just did you get your statistics from. they are so far from the truth. 
i'd think the world would be at the violent problems of all muslims and face, that muslims are incompatible by every other religion? 
the only thing that is enough is this discriminatory hate speech. 
the ons says 55%of victims are assaulted by a partner or ex partner. lock up all married people (and divorcees)! 
surely the british one is in respect and understanding respect peoples. 
why would it? why such hatred towards an entire faith? 
women and gay people face much much discrimination from right-wing non-muslim populist figures. (link to article about the 'homophobic muslim' stereotype) 
to ban people you respect from practicing their faith because of the actions of a few seem seem more that a bit unfair? 
studies have shown that cvs submitted under a non muslim name are three times more likely to be offered an interview than those with a muslim name attached. 
the far right have mastered the corrupt art of playing the victim and blaming other cultures for the violent beliefs taught in their main books. 
are you sure? how are an awful lot of muslim, muslim, researchers, and medical professionals for a religion which is supposedly incompatible with science. 
deported to where? many muslims were born in this country and are part of our culture and society. 
are you sure there are forms of muslims are different and that a lot of christianity like this way to follow 
yes, i am sure its followers, who devote huge amounts of time to studying the koran and learning about islam are in fact ignorant about it it really is. that makes sense. 
the myth that muslims are dangerous and violent is a product of our vilifying media. don't believe everything you read. 
islam, gangs and discrimination are the religious here. why should its mean that their society (not treated treated at every children from other other people. 
in the same muslims are hard and people to care of the families and neighbours. on most people. 
there's league table? 
you feel like you are talking about the middle east? that place that christianity originates from. sure. 
terrorists come in all religions and political views. people opposing trump were sent letter bombs, the 'troubles' saw christian terrorists on both sides of the border. let's challenge all terrorism. 
i feel aren't show at me at our next this in your your life should be best about this. 
christianity and islam are united in preaching love and leaving judgment to god / allah what should you preaching? 
islamic civilization led europe out of dark ages into the era of enlightenment and gave rise to its renaissance. now they contribute over 30 billion pounds to the uk economy; quite a large contribution by anyone's estimation. 
the christian world can deal far from dark muslims in the us are more more to take out creating other religious than christians. you can you can have something can can see that can can can you that their own society. 
in my opinion, i do not want all people in the world and 
part of the problem is no one wants to hurt each other any more' quote from donald trump @potus maybe he is a closet muslim? 
this is generalization. maybe the case you mentioned is just the minority. besides, some governments even destroys pepople's house. we should pay much more attention to this instead. 
complete real freedom be celebrated? 
aren't quran says that muslims should not seek hostility and those who haven't sought any war against them. jihadists do not represent the islamic faith. 
if that were really true why are there so many union flags around then? should we report the queen next time she is home? 
something has gone very wrong over here if you think that respecting other religions is encouragement of a genocide. 
there's more in islam about death and terror. it is ancient monuments and philosophy, and your view of it is quite simplistic! 
you would not say the many doctors, doctors, soldiers, humanitarians, scientists, and rights advocates are a nasty stain on humanity. generalised hate like this, 
as is a great generalisation to say anyone from pakistan deserves to be deported for rape. nationality has nothing to do with the likelihood someone will commit sexual assault. 
have you ever spoken to a mulsim? 
muslims feed the homeless london, cardiff, birmingham (everywhere) bbc news; muslims raise funds for synagogue, rescue flood victims, just google. 
no it isn't and most 'tolerant' places in the world accept all religions. 
i want to be suggesting the fact there are allowed in the rape criminals were isn't muslims. 
let's have the crusade. except did not the last one lead to child rape, enslavement and murder? 
i think the #catholicchurch #pope #childabuse might have them beaten hands down this is not restricted to anyone faith or community. 
what would 'all' pakistani people who contribute to our society without our culture and causing maybe together why would know why i thought from child and and them then 
muslims create much 70000 jobs in their firms in london alone, so no they do not refuse to work, 
what would 'all' muslims incompatible with western society? the vast majority of muslims in western society share western values of respect, freedom, tolerance, etc. there are only a few that have extremist anti-west views, these are not representative. 
because we we need to much our lies then! 
global world is not lost. all all muslims of people is not it than they go islam and muslims. 
when 400,000 muslims died in ww1 for britain, seems to me like this one is very one sided. 
are you suggesting we should not be democratic? or that the office is not won by merit, hard work and excellence. perhaps we should try nepotism? 
prejudice = pre-judging ie not knowing anything how can that be common sense? 
muslims are peace-loving, law-abiding and hard-working, contributing much to the uk economically and culturally. 
the yorkshire ripper' said god told him to committ his atrocitites. in neither case this is a justification. individuals are responsible for their actions, not whatever warped interpretation of a particular faith they cite as possible cause. 
in what way? 
i would not call it sad or self loathing to join a sisterhood of tolerance. 
how can you angry about an entire statement of a few? of 1.6 billion people from all walks of life? 
methodist, lutheran, jehovah's witness, catholic, protestant, there are different types of christianity and different countries interpret it different ways why do you think islam would be different? 
the quran teached justice and that criminals should be treated justly and be given the chance to reform. 
a large proportion of nhs workers are asian, and many muslim. without them we would not have a free 24/7 healthcare service. 
no muslims are white british people like like it to just religion or look living in every religion, they are it? if it aren't bad! 
do history teach you think how is this say about group of group of people? 
yes, the survey of muslim's 16% of muslim girls and 11% of muslim people are unemployed and claiming benefits. if others aren't working then they're not allow benefits just being taken care by by hard working family members. as i hope my children will do for me one day (are you listening son?). 
a real problem is the same was by islamophobic which hate speech muslims are the same book criticize going and speech. 
yes, the over-representation of muslims as terrorists has led to them that stopped and searched, and targeted by agendas like prevent disproportionately, not for 'just words' but for just as muslims. https://theconversation.com/prevent-counter-terrorism-strategy-remains-unfair-on-british-muslims-despite-home-office-efforts-108779. 
example? 
did history teach you nothing? how can you say this about an entire faith of people? 
criminals are given the punishment if they are guilty. doesn't matter what their race is. why are you so sure the the government is trying to cover things up? 
judging from your comment here, if you have been refused service it is likely because of hateful conduct, not the colour of your skin. 
i know many child who are wonderful people and have done nothing wrong to this world. you should should insult people based on their religion. 
great that i wonder so many non-muslim people are just british came and have the union next 
what exactly are the west going to 'win'? muslims are not waging a war on western society, it is only the fearmongering media spreading these myths and causing divide. 
i agree the people who are wonderful people and discrimination to all religions and life is that a lot from tradition and 
the only cover up these happens in the media is of the positive stories about muslims, extremist actions are the only ones ever highlighted. 
[link to raheem stirling article or other biased media example] media bias against the muslim community has been going on on years, do not be fooled by it any more. 
we start arabic numbers. 
given that a belief in the rule of law is generaly cited as a 'british value' - surely its important that this person is returned to the uk to stand trial for stand crimes they may have committed? 
why do that muslims are incompatible is an much banning the society? 
the qur'an encourages the pursuit of new knowledge and understanding. that sounds quite compatible with science to me. 
after most comes acceptance acceptance after acceptance comes love - - are halfway there! christianity and islam are united in preaching love now that is something to shout about. 
what is wrong with muslims living in europe? 
first of all, how you you know this this is just any valid sources prove it? because it sounds like nonsense. second of all, i do not think people you would employ someone without any skills or experience no matter how politically correct they would like to be. 
i agree that islam is an evil aberration, but to extend this to include up to 3 million people just in the uk is you plain silly. 
isn't polygamy common to a variety of cultures, and had been practiced by a range of religions. ask the mormons. 
actually, that muslims contribute billions to the economy, build smes, and contribute over than they take is not appeasing its gaining. 
all muslims must respect the law of the lands in which they live as is mandated by the qu'ran. 
who lunch you some sharia friends and am not. it hiv is ebola free! 
because we do. 
every person is a potential terrorist. what is your point? 
the ons says 55%of victims are assaulted by a partner or ex partner. lock up all married people (and divorcees)! 
there's the proportion of britain and who are muslims as it is among if you cannot say that muslims are doing terrorism and raping children, this is simply exaggeration. 
this is not true. 
how is somebody to less faith or their religious (uk)? 
do you have the statistics for domestic violence in great britain? this is even a huger problem in great britain! i'd suggest we first should think about our inner problems, and you suggest to just blame the outsiders in everything! 
islam is an belief faith and we should be blamed including the love of the world. 
muslim world face find it nice and prejudice of hate in your faith is not true. 
a much bigger threat to our diverse, tolerant western civilisation is hatred generalised to entire religions. 
the only cover up that remember was the same catholic church, but we remember that the actions of individuals do not reflect on the whole. 
except the ones intolerant of islam. who are very ones that that ignorant ignorant what what makes truly is. 
so heard from al-khawarizmi? you have him to thank for quite a lot of mathematics and astronomy! 
people have the right to build their churches and follow their confession. they are not trying to convert us all, are they? so we should just leave them at peace. 
you sound a bit paranoid mate, i do not think muslims feel the same way. 
in most muslims have continued to help our society. for instance, they have worked on countering violent extremism and building community cohesion. muslims also also have condemned terrorism and isis in plentiful news medias around the world. 
no, muslims led 31 billion to the uk economy and you'd call that a economy 
this is simply not true and how can you say this about such a large group of people from all walks of life? 
these isn't. this is a false dichotomy. all crime and hatred is wrong. 
well most we would not their our faiths and beliefs were based on their their faith #lovenothate. 
white men abuse more than any other group, they do not need gangs to groom, they are protected by institutions towards the church and hollywood and given positions of trust like teachers, sports coaches. why aren't you angry about that? 
actually the number of muslims living in the uk, this statement in a bit silly.you cannot repatriate someone who hasn't moved. 
this is not the 
that is simply very unusual generalisation, and should be intolerant of the western faith. 
learning about and respecting all faiths, including islam, is not nonsense. 
where did you get this conclusion from? there might be bias in the collecting of information. for example, in fact, large numbers of sexual offences were convicted by white men. 
the only ones in favour of brexit are the ones that that are ignorant about what it truly is. 
islam is not only practised as it as is even cultural practice regardless of anyone's religion. 
criminals are checking on a person's faith before the commission of their crimes? seems a lot of bother to me. 
replace islam with any group of people in your statement and you will see just how offensive this is. 
race hate has always had its roots as far right paranoia. migrants in the uk have always worked hard and made a positive difference to the communities they joined. 
that sounds like quite a violent threat. should i let the police know about this or? 
despite this book being 1400 years and and not belonging to our century as you say, can you provide other reasons why this book is dreadful? because i am struggling to figure this out. 
the quran does command muslim rape gangs. in fact, sexual violation is regarded by true muslims as as a violation of moral and divine law. 
just wondering what are you have to talk with bigger branding tactics designed to make us spend more money. 
the media scapegoats muslims and encourages division. when will you wake up and see you have been misled by institutions creating an 'us' and 'them' divide, demonising muslims to detract attention from bigger societal issues. 
one person of any religious about islam, is not mental 
i think this is a very inconsiderate thing to say, would you say the same thing about islamic non-muslims and christianity where christianity actually christianity and 
rapists will use any excuse to justify their actions. this is an abhorrent individual. 
let's also say that the uk's scapegoating or last suggest to my experience more out by white men. do your logic just cause this is a disproportionate rather to those other faith. 
what do you mean by 'islamized'? if mosques are build in punishment areas, i do not see this as easter but as representation of community in those areas? 
surely a religion is a religion and that be it not how and islam is their faith and 
surely it and not one of anyone or be just of all religion. 
do you think maybe making media paints this picture of islam to distract people from actual threats to civilisation, which are a conflict of interest for the powerful? climate change and capitalist exploitation spring to mind. 
anyone can locate some aspects that do not like like a religion, but to say that one is nothing but trouble is a bit too much, do not you think so? 
job applicants with non-muslim names are 3 times more likely to get a job interview than those with muslim names. remind me again why it is that they struggle to find work? 
i do not see what that is an war? so why do it? 
pretending islam is not a religion or that evil people are not exist in any other faith just does not help let's get real and tackle child abuse and slavery everywhere. 
british muslims contribute a more to the uk and you'd call that a threat? 
1- you if how is hatred towards an entire faith? 
don't mix up politics and faith. no faith really encourages violence, the way politicians (on every side and nation) interpret them however, is a different story. 
by your logic, the world will be diverse so long as islam isn't practiced in antactica? 
how can you say this about people who do not have anything at all from know with those terror attacks? 
why not? 'civilised' europe could benefit from the economy, and expertise and muslims here, the mix of cultures here is what makes europe great. 
the bible says that that was very few to us to hate and even don't believe most that terrorism are a peaceful and of hate and terrorism has something the bigger 
who are 'all'? you cannot decide for all people, you cannot decide what is my opinion, that is rude. 
women and gay people face much more discrimination from right-wing non-muslim populist figures. (link to article about the 'homophobic muslim' stereotype) 
ooer, you might meet someone that looks a bit different to you. 
the tea. 
so answer hatred with hatred? 
a part from all the police officers, teachers, nurses etc. who identify as muslim? 
have you really truely understand the religion islam, including its history, principles, or teaching? islam actually respect people to respect life and care for it. it is also what the majority of muslims follow. 
people run from their countries because they are unhappy to live there. they run from wars, bombing, poverty, hunger. pushing them back into their disasters is not humane. 
is it just a hard where i do not agree that it aim to take control of us. maybe they are trying to build their society inside our country, but you are hypothesizing too much,. 
many islamic scholars actively campaign against fgm, it is not mentioned in the qaran and is banned in a number of muslim countries. this is a cultural problem, not a religious one. it is not all religious to 
so, you say this highly educated muslim doctors, researchers, teachers are brainwashed lunatics? sorry, but you got this so wrong. 
i am not shared your opinion, but do only acknowledge that opinions, mine or your, do not have to be based on fact or knowledge. my 'experience' of muslims, as neighbours, colleagues, friends hasn't led me to view them as a problem. 
[fact check and post link to accurate statistics, statistic is likely false or extremely skewed][add meme] smh trying to post statistics when they're they're even accurate. 
children should not do any of that with white men or anyone they do not know islam or one's does do know if it does not feel right. suggesting only one group of men abuse leaves more children unsafe and vulnerable. 
do you have the right to decide now their right to build their life that be solve sent 
the proportion of global muslims is no more than that islamic non-muslims (add a link to stop employment statistics). 
show me evidence of this? 
this person may become the only one able to supply you some bread so, appreciate it! 
do you know, according to uk's official statistics, women were more likely to experience domestic abuse than men. this was true for all types of domestic abuse, other than non-sexual family abuse. around three times as many adults experienced sexual assault by a partner than by a family member. 
we will not know until the next census by recent survey suggest that the uk is increasingly a secular society with a growing percentage expressing no religous affiliation at all. 
muslim women actually find it nice to wear hijab. it is just right to not like it, but you should not impose your views on everyone else. 
islam isn't that about tacit acceptance. raise your voice against islamophobia! 
in all religions have met the people and then britain to some things it needs to fight and go and 
are you accusing all the britain muslims of antisemitism? i disagree, from these experience they are just usual people who do not believe their hate towards anybody, they just live their lives. 
and when cvs submitted under a non muslim name are 3 times more likely to get an interview than those submitted under a muslim name, the problem very not lies with those employers who discriminate against muslim women. 
how exactly are muslims oppressing other cultures? do you think maybe spreading the opinion that all muslims are homophobic and sexist demonises them and legitimises oppressing their culture? 
have you thought about what western value is what what is really about? 
if you actually knew more about those religions and cultures you would not say this. 
the vast majority of rapes are committed in the home, by someone the victim knows, or by a partner. there are numerous examples of rape culture in this country. (add a link to the everyday sexism project) 
whilst a small number of muslims were involved in this, the vast majority stand against against extremism (link to article about the muslim anti-extremism march in cologne) 
but as muslims contribute billions to the uk build smes, and contribute more than they take is not appeasing its gaining. 
i do not think that muslim people done to 'win' but it is only intolerant individuals like you trying to make this an us and them competition. 
but we could know any of white school or you that the more of what is what a majority of it? 
muslims must celebrate their own holidays without fear of being targeted by islamophobic hatred. 
enjoying your positive tea?? that came from india. 
why do you think muslim person will make a religion or from any group or what is what with more worried is it? 
so how come i met so many intelligent and smart muslim women then? i think you should not be so quick to judge. 
you cannot compare an faith of 1.6 billion to nazi. 
any religious text has even stopped that many ways. fortunately, for vast majority of muslims condemn these people. islam peace. is a much better place etc. should know that the bible, the torah, etc. as inciting hate too. 
positive news stories*. 
after checking the timetable, 'specialist' sessions' are more about 'gender' than faith segregation, sessions for 'women only', 'men only' and 1 hour a week for 'muslim women', which hardly seems a a fuss about. 
as intolerance then hatred is one of the biggest problems our country faces #spreadlovenothate. 
i would not use disgusting to describe any things since crime crime happenes in every country, that would be every country is disgusting. we should decrease the right rate by legislation, education, etc. 
i thought our society was based on respect tolerance and merit. hate and prejudice does not belong in western society. 
and if we were sent to lgbt out and all it would not be the christian 
violating of right for underrepresented communities (homosexuals, women, disabled people) takes place everywhere, and many native western people are also held accountable for it. oppressing rights is not the feature of islam but of our society in general. 
i do not think any other religious text has such a doctor, what this is much point? 
you can ask people of you are punished to. most people are such to do you cannot them and make the religion do not mean that they are suggesting to even the society? 
you seem to have a new superpower? ascertaining ethnicity and faith based on a person's last name? 
do you have any proofs that the rape epidemic exists? that it is due to muslim immigrants? i think that there are also many accidents every day, and not all of them are attributed to home so your words are really strong ones and i would like to see to facts. 
source check? 
no. a religion of 1.6 billion people is not the same as nazism and it is ignorant to say so. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
who do you say that the deportation of crimes and child exploitation due to sexual or in this was a country you disgusting. we should decrease the number of rape or 
does a religion will say it or being forced it it like not mean that everyone agrees with it? 
photo? don't did you report them? or just another internet myth. 
have you say the people of muslims about muslims and i are not about? 
provide examples of those in the muslim community working. 
no. a religion of 1.6 billion people is not the same as nazism and it is ignorant to say so. 
to ban people you respect from practicing their faith because of the actions of a few does seem more that a bit unfair? 
there is a muslim invaders and this is just hatred. 
what it really so not. at up all the koran just some of far that christianity here its christianity like it? 
so you are saying an entire faith of 1.6 billion is not peaceful? this is ignorant. 
this is a very sad story! but every muslim person i know confirms that rapism is a sin and it is not justified in the qu'ran. 
are you purposely trying to avoid good news stories about muslim? 
that is a blatant lie. (attach unemployment politicians, 
sounds like thinly veiled sexism to me. 
muslim unemployment stands at around 12%, not a great deal higher than white british unemployment. the problem is not muslims refusing to work, it is barriers to employment and a system that does not allow equality of opportunity between different faiths and cultures. 
so these families came in to do cheap labour at textile mills in saville and then made a life for themselves? shocking! how could they? 
our world does not tolerate oppression of these groups by muslims being than more than it tolerates oppression of these groups by anyone else. 
did you even bother to google this before you tweeted it? it tweets so so incorrect i do not know how how could expect anyone to believe them. 
are you sure? 12 muslim nobel prize winners would suggest otherwise. 
no because muslims and therefore islam live in western nations and add so much positivity. 
what exactly is the west going to 'win'? muslims are not waging a war on western society, it is only the fearmongering media spreading these myths and causing divide. 
please check this [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/01/immigrant-muslim-cancer-research] 
by your logic, the world would be diverse so long as islam isn't practiced in antactica? 
that sounds like quite a violent threat. should i let the police know about this or? 
how can you say such hateful things about an entire faith? 
the world would be a better place without people were more tolerant to each other. 
this is simply not true and how can you say this about such a large group of people from all walks of life? 
my friend, but do not see all western people hate islam. statistics showed that france, muslims and elsewhere in northern europe view muslims favorably. 
hmm, now what other muslim people will not like? 
if muslims are treated any differently by any muslims. by treated worse (link to article about stop and search and police targeting of muslims). 
the west continually bombs eastern and eastern and countries. maybe maybe should stop blowing people up. 
the quran does that command rape gangs. in fact, sexual violation is regarded by true muslims as as a violation of moral and divine law. 
could guess what the same point about islam who live where say, it not? 
this has not factual basis. 
perhaps we should stop exporting goods or buying stuff from from islamic countries? while were at it give back their numbers, maths and architecture? 
has history taught you nothing about this level of hatred? 
aren't places of worship about far more than just prayers? 
because my opinion, that people want to emigrate to london means london is a charming and enjoyable place for living. isn't that a wonderful thing and we should keep this trait? 
i'd acknowledge that there is a issue of some of our towns with exploitation by men from a pakistani muslim heritage, but to label this as an exclusivewly muslim problem is to ignore the scale and seriousness of the issue. 
yes, we do. 
all muslims died in terrorist attacks such as 9/11 in the us and 7/7 in the uk. 
if any muslims are unemployed it is probably because of the discrimination they face, which tweets like this reinforce. 
that is why biased news reports would have the believe, but violent incidents are committed by people of all faiths, muslims just just reported on more. 
you are generalizing even much. christian law are also known to rape children and murder people! but we know that muslims are being exceptions and not a rule. i think the same is true about muslims. 
there's a few people i do not want them but deporting british citizens feels a bit like a dictatorship. 
violence is a muslim issue. especially all all violence being endured by muslims due to hateful intolerance and discrimination. 
all muslims? sounds like a bit of every world i i would say that and rapism is a sin of speech. it seems to to many people support the religion and criticizes violence. 
any person of (any) faith. would understand that our responsibilities towards tolerance, peace and justice is paramount. if you would a faith i am shocked that you would question it. 
so what are muslims oppressing other cultures? do you think maybe spreading the opinion that all muslims are homophobic and sexist demonises them and legitimises oppressing their culture? 
muslims donate more to charity than any other group, contribute more than 30 billion pounds to the uk economy and make up a significant part of our nhs workforce. i think that is quite a nice contribution. 
so actually the bible, the torah, etc. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
google image search to provide factual information about the image if possible. ie when and where it is from and provide context, ie this was a small faction that has been condemned my main stream islam and happened 15 years ago. 
or have we been coexisting and they are suddenly suddenly offended by people being being being you? 
what do you base your view on? 
if it really would it certainly hasn't been a fact. 
the quran says 55%of victims are assaulted by right-wing partner or ex partner. lock up all married people (and divorcees)! 
i do not think what muslims have done to you, but i know many beautiful and kind persons among them. so it is very rude and inconsiderate of you to call them disgusting. 
the ons says 55%of victims are assaulted by a partner or ex partner. lock up all married people (and divorcees)! 
many muslims feed the homeless, offer shelter, work in hospitals, schools and keep the country going. maybe we should invite more? 
christian europeans are the ones that then expanded the slave trade to an industrial scale and instrumentalised exploitation as a key component of our economy. 
the world would be a very very dark place without muslims who contribute a lot to our society. what about our muslim, doctors, scientists, philanthropists, actors, job-creators. 
do you know that anti-islamism is not a form of anti-semitism? it is equally wrong to hate jews and muslims. 
i think becoming a terrorist takes a very narrow minded person with a very closed world view, ah err sorry. 
enjoying your afternoon tea?? that came from india. 
women and gay people face face our discrimination from right-wing non-muslim populist figures. (link to article about the 'homophobic muslim' stereotype) 
for 1.6 billion people could be terrorists? 
how about this. [insert link to muslim group cleaning newcastle streets after new year's or more up to date example]. 
your afternoon tea. 
what have you ever done to us? well, coffee, clocks, cameras, hygiene, universities, surgical instruments, maps, music, algebra. 
so answer hatred with hatred? 
bloody retribution? most people of all faiths just just getting on with their lives and a tiny minority like your comment seems seems to trying to create conflict. but i do not think any of you are winning. 
i have last last so i know says people people and it to any others. 
i think many people who are wonderful people and have done nothing wrong to our society you should help people based on the religion and 
why do you base your view on? 
muslims contribute much to the uk, through their hard work and charitable activities. 
what is wrong and muslims living in europe? 
muslim, and discrimination do not either. 
maybe looking to the group of that will thought wrong and islam, 
no, this is not a uniquely muslim crime and 
every islamophobic person has the potential to use that intent for terrorism or terrorism against muslims. terrorism comes in all shapes and sizes. 
its also early 'the guess the results of the next census, but all indications are that 'persons of no faith' are an increasing majority. 
a nation where everyone is the same sounds like a nation of robots to me. 
or though it is difficult to have exact report on sexual crimes, on the sex offenders register are white men, based on former chief crown prosecutor for the crown prosecution service in 2017. stop blaming others and help our girls and women. 
to be fair, i would guess its hard to feel a sense of belonging seems you are perpetually identified as a problem? 
muslim women face discrimination and prejudice because of their religion in the west which isn't present in muslim majority countries. 
we will not know until the next census by recent survey suggest that the uk is increasingly a secular society with a growing percentage expressing no religous affiliation at all. 
and pipe clocks, bombs bombs to sent opposition, including robert de niro, those individuals do not represent all of trump's supporters though. 
an entire faith of 1.6 billion people is not a cancer. 
what is that? sounds like you are blaming another culture and feeling like a victim. 
if we were refusing work then they will not be on on so this is your problem. 
if they were violent were you have been punished too. why do you think someone of a certain religion is automatically guilty? 
so you come that we should be democratic? or in public people is they exactly spend these come from excellence. perhaps we should try nepotism? 
that sounds very extreme, remind me again which group is the violent dangerous one? 
does any religion have a 'sell-by-date'? 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
no, this is not a fact because it is simply not true. 
maybe from the violence that and there are a hundred examples of love men and kindness give special for the other of others. 
no, unemployment stands at around 12%, not a great deal higher than white british unemployment. the problem is not muslims refusing to work, it is barriers to employment and a system that does not allow equality of opportunity between different faiths and cultures. 
no, 1.6 billion muslims are not the enemy? 
is it just words? things you see in life life do not correspond with this opinion. to me it seems that all people are equally punished for crimes, is. it a european person or an immigrant. also, it is not correct to deny people entry based on their nationality. 
without most are allowed any differently by any crimes are public criminals does to say that religious events. it is just correct to align religion and criminality. 
positive news stories*. 
muslim civilization have shaped for the better and science, arts and medicine. muslims are invaluable in the our hospitals running, transport going, and much more. which of those must you like to get rid of? 
once you burn books you burn people. has history taught you nothing? 
islam is that only sisterhood of tolerance and understanding across the world. 
is it civilised from listening to those muslim and people are britain to islam? i would say it would find they contribute to the society for how than they can to be through more rapists live to 
is even muslims are non-muslim and it is not ancient so you if you can have the many that many rapists would discrimination or terrorism and hate in our society is no common and 
the only cover to favour of brexit are the ones that that are ignorant about what it truly is. 
we deported over 6,000 foreign nationals for criminal offences over 2016/17. i am guessing, but i not all of them went back to pakistan. criminality and sexual offending are not a matter of nationality, are they? 
my think you'd do not think all western people hate islam. statistics showed that france, germany and elsewhere in northern europe view muslims favorably. 
the negative stereotypes and extreme examples in the media are not representative of all muslims. don't believe everything you read. 
so much hatred. we must respect and understand all peoples. 
great that you are defending women and gay people would do why they do share the feeling it is really just an opportunity to take a dig at islam. btw just as in the catholic church attitudes in islam are changing fast. 
who said spare the cane spoil the child? how many non muslims are suggesting violence against muslims? sounds like an issue in the western world. 
when having 2015 13,286 muslims receive more in the uk were in all or 
if i spray something that a wall and tag it hrh does that make it the law? i am even willing to add a stamp as photo id. first class of course. there's enough going on without fake and internet internet internet 
this is not true and what you would not make this hateful things about an entire statements so much hatred. 
what is truly cancerous is hatred towards an entire faith. 
did you read the next line? it literally says the punishment and that the person who commits that 'is to be treated like a fornicator'. 
even if we had its abide for and muslims in the vast scale and exploitation is a bigger terrorist threat to positive about you are the muslim muslim 
don't trust police, social workers who anyone who can tell you the truth and show just how prejudiced and misleading this tweet is. 
oh the world world would say the hate hate fuelling support against others? 
according to the ceop, white men make up 100 per cent of recorded 'type 2' group abusers, who target one because of a longstanding paedophilic interest. by your standard, we should get rid of them too. 
don't those religions have instuctions for what they deem to be 'rightous living', voluntary codes or law's (if you insist) for the faithful to follow. have a peek at leviticus if you think its only islam has has elements are intrepreted in extremist ways. 
are you show an an excuse to the image in the you you are just something something does not mean with muslim or they they would not be your hate putting muslims. 
everyone has a place of what what how making? 
i do not think that muslim criminals will receive different treatment or even privileges? 
except when you need a taxi, a train, a doctor, an olympic medal, great food, sounds a bit like a monty python sketch. 
we would be arabic numbers, maths, medicines, and rely on trade and loans from islamic countries. islam is an intricate part of civilization we know we know 
oh! you mean the home of modern maths and science? 
muslims in many muslim-majority were terrorism in some of the terrorism are non-muslim attacks, armed and defending less which within other fields. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith who add so much to society? 
the shockingly low number of rape convictions in the uk shows not enough counteraction from the police and gov in rape cases generally, of which the vast majority are not committed by muslims. 
doing it right'? i think you have got your moral compass upside down! 
the society seems not pretty much to western society or any right at intolerance of maybe it is not that way of them need to make it an other culture. 
that is a misunderstanding. i observe from the many hardworking muslims contributing to our economy. 
how many people have you seen evangenical christian preachers and followers on the streets most saturday's in most uk cities? you do not think that other faiths should be allowed the same? 
have you thought about what western value is what islam is really about? 
the quoted report refers to 'countless faith schools' that illegally maintain gender segregation. isn't it more accurate to frame this as a matter of lack of resources for enforcement, rather than presenting the story as an 'islamic issue'? 
you really want to support the role of the state in prescribing what people should eat or drink? 
have you heard about the arab counter-terrorism coalition? 
does prohibiton of anything ever work? i though religious tolerance was one of our 'british values'? 
using violence does not sound like a muslim issue, it sounds like a tactic used by all groups to some extent, religious or not, that you are framing as muslim to support your own agenda. 
we have said with the british christians? of course not punish the individual being muslims. however, i we've words to look on a bit person will think it 
because victorian girls and women were more equally with respect? that was when there are there in the country. are we really much too now? #metoo? 
let's do the timewarp again! let's not re-run the crusades. it did not end well last time. 
getting rid of 22% of the world's population sounds quite laborious, perhaps we should just punish the small minority of people who actually support a crime instead. 
or they actually actually concerned about lgbt and rights and the bible does not exactly you the best track record. but we've learnt to focus on it is positive values rather than get dragged down by specifics. 
explain? this is not the case. 
that is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
islamic civilization led europe out of dark ages into the era of enlightenment and gave rise to its renaissance. now they contribute over 30 billion pounds to the uk economy; quite a large contribution by anyone's estimation. 
what, you think the people will spend those lives reading, learning and practicing islam not not know what is really about? 
you have a stance, that is your right. but it is not your right to decide for other people (your children and grandchildren) and insult other people. 
if they were work work then they will not be on benefits. so what is your problem. 
today, in june 2018, for example, up with 2,000 afghan scholars scholars from around the country issued a fatwa, an islamic directive, saying 'the ongoing war in afghanistan is forbidden under the islamic law'. so clearly not all muslim clerics are warmongers. 
except that you need a taxi, a train, a doctor, an olympic medal, great food, sounds a bit like a monty python sketch. 
yeah. but no. computer says 16% of muslim women and 11% of muslim men are unemployed and claiming benefits. if others aren't working then they're not on benefits just being taken care of by hard working family members. as i hope my children will do for me one day (are you listening son?). 
is this just a way forward? i do not think that religious practice is responsible for bad behaviour of some people. clearly there are other motivations for the type of behaviour. 
tolerance of people with different religious beliefs is not an illness, hatred and fear of people different than you sounds much more more than some religions. 
maybe because people obviously haven't understood this and keep generalising a few extreme cases to the whole religion? 
show me evidence of this? 
have you actually spoken to muslim people and asked whether it offends them? 
why? what is wrong about learning about a world religion that many of our peers practice? 
the negative stereotypes and extreme examples of the media are not representative of all muslims. don't believe everything you read. 
i think the government has a very good understanding of people should be deported and members of the public should leave this type of decisions to them? 
by any group will you being group just understand you nothing? what you you said said said on western 
you would say that same muslim doctors, researchers, soldiers, and scientists, and rights advocates are a nasty stain on humanity. generalised hate like this, however, is. 
by published group of 1.6 billion people is not a plague. 
quick while they're distracted being doctors, nurses, teachers and just getting on with their lives. (its comments like yours that creates tension and conflict) 
where this misconception is just hatred. 
it has not factual basis. 
muslims criticize violence and terrorism as well. they even became victims of isis after they denounced isis for its violent actions. 
terrorism and targeting the general public with bombs, assault rifles or any other means is horrific, there is no excuse but lets be clear when a white man does it its called mental illness regardless of what groups he belongs to; when a black man does it its called terrorism. 
this is demonstrably false. radical christian terrorism has been behind countless attacks. terrorism can come from any group and the only thing all terrorism has in common is that it is abhorrent. 
what about the muslim people people born in this country? where do you propose to deport them to? 
i am say any book about the picture of islam to distract women from actual threats to civilisation, which are a conflict of interest for the powerful? climate change and capitalist exploitation spring to mind. 
are you suggesting we should not be democratic? or that the office is not won that merit, hard work and excellence. perhaps we should try nepotism? 
aren't easter eggs just another example of corporate greed cashing in on religious celebrations? surely easter is a good time to reflect on our consumerism, what are you giving up for lent? 
muslim women face find and nice to wear hijab. it is like right not not like it, it, you should not impose your views on everyone else. 
you could blame an entire faith. 
let's be honest a quick google search shows that simply simply true. please tell me where on earth you managed to drag up those stats from? 
1000s of muslims died in ww1 and 2 defending britain, 1000s still in uk armed forces defending peace across the world. bloody retribution on them, really? 
grooming gangs like those in rochdale and huddersfield have been rightfully convicted. does that look like police collusion to you? 
muslims create over 70000 jobs in their firms in london alone, so no they do not refuse to work, they in fact create work for others. 
there are many religions and it is hard to compare them. however, i guess islam has not that many people that religions and it as it is the whole we we our world and oppressed and cultures. 
why often contributed to an a fact for many people living in a world and have been over these were the best and 
i am not sure what you think the west will be the 'winner' of. islam isn't in competition with western culture, and the idea it threatens it is a myth spread to incite fear. 
i think any book written that long ago probably would. 
religions also promote arts, sciences, help to develop the community. islam is not an exception. islam is not about death and despair. 
think you are digging yourself into a bit of a hole there. 
i think the race would disagree. i certainly want more our muslim doctors, teachers, lawyers and politicians here. 
why would you say that? british government has its strict immigration policy which does not allow every islam or any immigrant. 
i agree that isis is an evil aberration, but to extend this to include up to 3 million people just in the uk is just plain silly. 
where did you get this figure from? might i get some real evidence for this? because this seems very much unrealistic. 
many islamic scholars actively campaign against fgm, it is not mentioned in the qaran and is banned in a number of muslim countries. this is a cultural problem, not a religious one. 
violence is apparent in all religious books. can christianity be blamed for inciting it in the old testament? 
that sounds very extreme, remind me again which group is the violent dangerous one? 
i have never seen many many people celebrating christmas this year and as far as i know none of muslims were offended. so, what are you talking about? 
at most, eggs are just learning more about different religions. you are using very strong and unnecessary words and 
who are 'all'? you decide them you people, you cannot decide what is my opinion, that are rude. 
these are gross crimes that are surely common that people who may profess or be ascribed adherence to a range of faiths.although viewed from 'the inside' unlikley to be percieved as 'devout'. more about behaviours than matters of doctrine. 
we will not really until the next census by recent survey suggest that the uk is increasingly a secular society with a growing percentage expressing no religous affiliation at all. 
violence is actually more common in the bible than in the qur'an. (link to independent article about analysis of both books finding this). that noted, violence exists within and without religion. 
having a mosque built down the road is causing you problems? really? 
i want them here? 
where did you get this information from? i do not believe any crime would be free from judge. we should have more failth in english laws and people who execute the laws. 
the vast majority of muslims are people is wrong. the same thing of the other teachings like the religion to seem to be a religion religion. 
appeasement? 1.6 billion muslims are not the enemy? 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
a part from anything the police officers, teachers, nurses etc. who identify as muslim? 
have you thought about the consequence child rapists might cause? 
small people of people of some groups are many reasons and this very very true? i think you talk to be an lies and then 
getting rid of 22% of the world's population sounds quite laborious, perhaps we should just punish the small minority of people who actually commit a crime instead. 
muslims also contribut a lot to our society. by you manys than that our own people would not want to do, or doing cutting edge research. 
so 1.6 billion people could be terrorists? 
judging from your comment here, if you have been refused service it is likely likely just hateful conduct, not the colour of your skin. 
source please? also, even true how true this just representative of all islam? 
your statistics are not right, but did you get them? why skew the stats to focus on muslims when every terrorist, bomber, and rogue shooter needs to be stopped. 
sounds more like the catholic church to me #pope#childabuse #inquirycsa. 
i have met so many non-muslim people adhering to british values. what do you base your view on? 
by all modern society have you to say what what muslims you thought for 
hate really? if the doctors, doctors, teachers, fire fighters, taxi drivers that rescued the manchester bombing victims, the ones working to stop cancer, feed the homeless. see where i am going? 
did people who make such sweeping statements based on hate and ignorance belong in our civilisation then? 
95% of muslims rapists feel loyalty to the uk in which in ww1. 
does all other religions are criminals are there is live culture in respect, peace and 
women and gay people face more persecuted by right-wing groups by non-muslim (link to lgbt and and non-believers. 
except when you need a taxi, a train, a doctor, an olympic medal, great food, sounds a bit like a monty python sketch. 
substitute 'christianity' and 'church' for 'islam' and 'mosque' and you have an accurate synopsis of the colonisation of africa and indian by the british empire. 
when you start selling eggs in february its always been about money and not religion. 
evidence please? 
you mean they are not based on behalf of me. 
why are you say such an offensive statement about a religion of 1.6 billion people from 
you really want to support the role of the state in prescribing what people should eat or drink? 
stats show muslims are more likely to be victims of crime, not perpetrators. this kind of sentiment is no only serves to fuel hate crime against muslims. 
most muslims are well-integrated in society and do not want to be 'appeased' and instead treated as normal citizens in society. 
if by appeasement you really mean keeping the nhs running, trains running, taxis going, hard working people fed, late night emergency beer runs possible then yeah, its mental. 
can you give a link to which report about people in prison for criticizing muslims? i cannot believe it until i see official data. 
right-wing number of terrorist activities perpetrated by the uk are greater in number (in the us) than those motivated by islamic extremism. 
if you would making more contribute to per over over different more religious group, so at mend statistics and/or example of one donation from a mosque], so i am struggling to see its problem with mosques where are funds are mostly raised. 
for hundreds of years we weren't allowed to build different kinds of churches in britain, but we are better than that now. 
how can you say that about an entire faith? 
white men abuse more than any other group, they do not need gangs to groom, they are protected by institutions like the church and hollywood and given positions of trust like teachers, sports coaches. why aren't you angry about that? 
actually any one is it is is the hate speech. 
that is quite quite generalisation. what have 'all' muslims done to deserve being deported? 
i am not use that that have the west to be over too crimes, communities in the citizens do you trying to do a mental illness. this is stop 
homophobia and sexism are not muslim attitudes, there are many non-muslims who are homophobic, sexist, and intolerant of other cultures. the qur'an teaches tolerance and peace. 
islam is incompatible with western society and all western world what intolerance and 
i do not see anything wrong in trying to understand different cultures and religions better. most important, i would not call it a mental illness. this is disrespectful. 
it is no more totalitarian than any other religion. only extremists using islam for their own means enforce totalitarian principles. these aren't reflective of the majority of muslims, even if the media tricks us into thinking so. 
all people who used such blatant lies and hate are incompatible with any western society. 
it is just a sweeping fiction if i ask me! 
the negative stereotypes and extreme examples in the media are not representative of all muslims. don't believe everything you read. 
didn't realise we were against each other. [insert number of muslim doctors] seems like they're making britain stronger. 
haven't movements like #metoo , the church's child sex scandal, and the offenders are non-muslim celebrities non-muslim in sexual assault proven that rape is in no way a muslim-specific issue? 
since muslims in rape, for countries and made a being tank including that been the the world. 
isn't polygamy common about a variety of cultures, and had been practiced by a range of religions. ask the mormons. 
isn't like your comment then. 
if you had said 'the home counties' i might have given this tweet a like. 
uhm, maths. 
and after you have done that who's gonna taxi you home, provide that takeaway after a hard days graft and nurse those callouses on your news and do not get me started on the doctors you might need. 
have you centuries about every muslim about their opinion? i suppose not. then please do not speak for everybody! 
the companies can be their own policies criminals are conditioned by globalization or marketing. it is not necessary to attribute everything to the muslim invasion. 
the 26% of the unemployed who are asian and british/asian are helping to fight cancer. 
i feel you anger. the often ignored fact is that around 90% of the criminals were persons known to the child. besides, most of people convicted of child abuse offences were white men. sexual exploitation of children should be stopped and prevented. please help our girls: visit english national domestic violence helpline and national society for the prevention of cruelty to children. 
except when you need a taxi, a train, a doctor, an olympic medal, great food, sounds a bit like a monty python sketch. 
what it with muslims living in western society just sure of christianity give a lot of our people who are the sexual ones and christianity and their culture? 
but the ones i know are just hard working people taking care of their families and neighbours. like most people. 
does it where i really said of this was in the labour 
christmas isn't banned, do you have got to say 'winter celebration', candy canes are honestly you? (unless you are diabetic). this is manufactured manufactured outrage to create anti-muslim sentiment. chill. 
muslims contribute much to europe and have done since the 19th century. 
what do only mean these from british major major beliefs in not encourage century and and have just to you? 
everyone is a potential everything, what would you like to be? 
have you actually spoken to muslim people and asked whether it offends them? 
this is a poor/non-existent understanding of epidemiology. perhaps a little research on the spread of disease is called for. 
you use people you have to want for everyone most of a country, so should cannot be more about this. 
i take so you are just up with you place but where actually, it only just in us but why do not think that someone hate without making racist statements. 
how often you say this about people who do not 
double standards all round lots of british culture and christian faiths oppress women, homosexuals and other cultures from #equalpay #metoo #timesup job restrictions in the church to condoning/ hiding sexual violence and child exploitation #thetruthproject. 
islam does not given our multicultural western society. unfortunately for you, intolerance doesn't. 
though looking at your tweet, i am think what is left would be worse. 
such dehumanising language against 1.6 people. 
the point of listening to muslim women, and women in general, is that they could broaden and enlighten your view of the world. 
grow up. 
so many muslims born in ww1 for britain, seems to me like this hate is very one sided. 
methodist, picture of easter everywhere as easter are really really about? 
look police violent stats. 
even trump would if it is not allow our religion of their religion that with his own issue. 
because we were were much about what was really very few of extreme first cases by right-wing muslims. 
today, in many muslim-majority community, stats even equal, even higher in some places, treatment as men. for example, many women work as scientists, engineers, lawyers, etc. 
non-muslims are the right who used slavery to build the foundations of western society and relied on it to advance capitalism. what is your point? 
yes, i am sure its followers, i devote huge amounts of time to studying the koran and learning about islam are in fact ignorant about what it really really is. makes makes sense. 
your statistics are not right, if you have get them? why skew the stats to focus on muslims when every terrorist, bomber, and rogue shooter needs to be stopped. 
can i suggest that their deportation of up to 3 million people, a large proportion of whom were born in the uk does not reflect 'our values' in the way i understand them. 
all muslims? that is a bit of an exaggeration i would say. do not blame an entire community for actions of a few. 
by 'no muslims being and anyone can just just because they do just on it. and you cannot believe the damn 
fgm is not a muslim practice. it is a cultural practice that is often tied to religion as a way to justify it. not all muslims practice it and not not those that practice it are muslim! 
given that a belief in the rule of law are generaly cited as a 'british value' - surely its important that this person is returned to the uk to stand trial for whatever crimes they may have committed? 
christmas still seems to be going ahead in this country, who exactly are these muslims that are offended by it? sounds like fake news to me. 
oh, the 95% of british muslims who feel loyalty to the uk? sounds terrifying! 
no, islam is a religion of 1.6 billion people from all walks of life. 
substitute 'christianity' and 'church' for 'islam' and 'mosque' and you have an accurate synopsis of the colonisation of africa and indian by the british empire. 
this is not true and how can you say this about an entire faith? 
do you know that muslims have never a fact deal of our experience child hate before are checking the punishment 
except when you need a taxi, a surgeon, a teacher, a train, a doctor, an olympic great great food, sounds a bit like a monty python sketch. 
stats show show you are more likely to be victims of crime, not perpetrators. this kind of sentiment is false false serves to fuel hate crime against muslims. 
1.6 billion people could be the enemy? 
the far right have mastered the corrupt art of playing the victim and blaming other cultures for the violent beliefs taught in their main books. 
evidence for this? this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
this is generalization. how can you say this about hundreds of millions of people? 
well at least they're not taking our jobs then! 
go on talking to yourself, no one will listen. 
i take people will not much another threat or which crime from us from people of the british were born in the uk is is really like disgusting. we should be worried of the people. 
that is what the headlines suggest but actual cases where migrants are the abuser is just a drop for the ocean compared to the total number of cases. 
the negative stereotypes and extreme examples in the media are not representative of all muslims. don't believe everything you read. 
the knowledge western society is built on was discovered by islamic scholars, then colonialists claimed it is their own. our society would not be so developed without muslim contributions to science, medicine, and many other fields. 
there are many of muslims protesting against isis. seriously, do a google search. 
let's do the timewarp again! let's not re-run the crusades. it did not end well last time. 
have you checked violent crime statistics? the idea that there is an epidemic is just an attempt at scare mongering in order to demonize the muslim community. religion does not make anyone likely to more likely to rape someone. 
learning different religions so we can live in the inclusive society is nonsense? i strongly disagree. 
there's a few people i do not want here but deporting british citizens feels a hard like a dictatorship. 
we need to work together to eradicate cse once and for all. individuals are the problem, it does not come from any religion, biased media attempting to scapegoat is being blind to the whole religion. 
this is generalization. maybe the case you mentioned is just the minority. besides, some governments even destroys pepople's house. we should pay much more attention to this instead. 
you are suggesting we should not be democratic? or that public office is not won by merit, hard work and excellence. perhaps we should try nepotism? 
the christian world would be far from tolerant. muslims in the us are more likely to take tolerant attitudes toward lgbt people than christians. maybe we can all learn something from them? 
islam isn't having many followers, that is it where we doing any muslim and 
no one is offended by people celebrating christmas. myths like this are manufactured by right-wing sources to make minorities and the left look easily offended, and invalidate the issues they really care about. 
these are wicked words. but if one one person that, it does that mean that it? 
because victorian girls and women were treated equally with respect? that was when no muslims from the country. are we really think better now? #metoo? 
#visitmychurch are you blaming the people for the lands of a few? and, many importantly, it does not really think it? 
i noticed what you said and this concerns it caused. actually, muslims are kind and sincere. however, people usually can access only negative events and issues about islam and do not consider good news meaningful. we do not want only fear exists in the society. hence, we should help people know about islam and muslims. 
or maybe appeasement to muslims is not tolerance and hate give that the try! 
muslims donate more to charity than any other group, contribute more than 30 billion pounds to the uk economy and make up a significant part of our nhs workforce. i think that is quite a nice nice 
surely it one right be oppressed and everyone supported to end oppression within their communities #lovenothate. 
anyone can locate some aspects they do not like in a religion, but to made that? one is nothing but trouble is a bit too much, do not you think so? 
have you asked every single muslim about their opinion? i suppose not. then please do not speak for everybody! 
women and gay people have been persecuted by many groups all over the world and it needs to change. is there is particular reason you are picking on islam? 
what is your sweeping statement to make to someone with a another peace and politicians too. 
london has gone through many major changes with new communities, during the wars, during the industrial revolution, saxon invasions. who do you think the real brits are? or is it just colour you are worried about? 
christianity and islam are united in preaching love and leaving judgment to god / allah what are you preaching? 
what is muslims ever done for us? well, coffee, clocks, cameras, hygiene, universities, surgical instruments, maps, music, algebra. 
every religious person would like the religion to be respected, this is not only muslim people. secondly, i've never seen them demanding for everyone's respect? 
the quran teached justice and that criminals should be treated justly and be be the chance to reform. 
please read this article written by a rotherham grooming gang survivor https://ind.pn/2ghjgn7. 
in those who taught some about islam and you'd care about the teachings? it is a narrow mindset. 
as is paranoia. 
have you ever spoken to a mulsim? 
since when having family is portrayed in such dehumanizing way? 
why is a religion cause death? sounds a bit extreme, no?! 
[find positive and up to date example of muslim people to to their community.] doesn't really look like it to me. 
race hate has always had its roots in far right paranoia. migrants in the uk have always worked hard and made a positive difference to the communities they joined. 
maybe you are the one of needs to assimilate to living in a multicultural society with people who are different from you? 
i suppose not think what is possible for the problems in islam taught to respect western crime. and say islam about christianity actually all the practice that are not more being common of the words and 
the ones who deserved to be punished, were punished. if others are innocent, clearly they do not deserve to get penalized? 
why would you say that british government are the strict immigration policy which does not allow every islam or any immigrant. 
what do you think it is then? 
unfortunately, hate can be found in all walks of life. it is no more prevalent in muslim communities. 
what have muslim people done to you? you you like to be on their place and be repatriated? these are serious words and one cannot say them without thinking of consequences! 
seems odd like the western society was build on the backs of the rest of the world. 
there are centuries old islamic communities in europe. 
seriously, i am its just what values you do not get hate but 
no one are allowed to rape anyone. there is no double standards, criminals go to prison, and religion and nationality have nothing to deal with it. 
could all the many muslim you born in our values and are are are struggle to do just every society. 
if i think a faith had forget to capitalise islam i in it. 
what happened from the good old british values of stuff like 'tolerance' and 'respect for the rule of law' - what i are suggesting sounds like mob rule, vigilante action and people running around with burning torches? 
doesn't 'prohibition' always fail because it adds a certain glamour that porudes the opposite of the intended effect? 
that might be because of the discrimination they face in the labour market. 
all forms of hatred are wrong and should be countered. 
then the violent protesters in support of tommy r were muslims? 
no muslims are also against honest working like every other religion and most abuse is and family or friends or within an institution. do you really want to protect children or members. you are using csa as an excuse for something else? 
people are uk rapists must build a much to their countries and they finish their sentences. 
try running the nhs without them and other migrants! 
where did you get this conclusion from? there might be bias in the collecting of information. for example, in fact, large numbers of sexual offences were convicted by white men. 
no. having a diverse society is a positive. there is no 'invasion'. 
except for all the people who are muslim and live in the west peacefully? 
maybe muslims are actually a nice to wear hijab. it is your right to look like it, but you are you impose your views on everyone else. 
every muslim is also a potential peacemaker, doctor, philanthropist. what is your point? 
my friend, seems like a nice fellow, so i wonder why you think he is likley to kick off at a moments notice. 
why would not you. it country one has being face anything or they are not be by every faith or that the only up 
do you think a media written about human violence is encourages terrorism or even even much of years and and the same action by the powerful? and change about the other to the whole world. 
no one is stopping you from celebrating easter, nor are they offended by it. 
a true where everyone is the same is no a nation of robots to me. 
1) a quick google search shows that your stats are plain wrong about everything and 2) most global terrorism is motivated by politics and not religion. this is why no one is talking about it. 
individuals of all the discrimination is such any excuse to any public acts for islam has been the people of it. 
the victims of terror are muslim. 
learning different religions so we can live in the inclusive society is nonsense? i strongly disagree. 
rapism and extremism are indeed problems of the modern society, but does it mean that they are attributed to muslims only? this is a much broader problem, we not deal with it, but no need to be chauvinist and accuse muslims. 
actually the quran quite likes dogs, animals and if you read it carefully all people even non believers, like christianity its only god /allah that should judge. 
man spreads hate, encourages intolerance, why do we accept this? and they want to continue this filth? 
err, i think you have got this victim thing down quite well. 
well, 
fgm is not a muslim practice. it is a cultural practice that is often tied to religion as a way to justify it. not all muslims practice it and not all those that practice it are muslim! 
religion generalised an integral part of our society, surely it is a good thing that it preaches peace. 
explain? this is not the case. 
what it is by muslim people like trying to like it like i know such muslims are by muslims and this are an tolerated, and an search and you why are you stop this about an entire or the problem? 
given that the vast majority of muslims live peaceful, normal lives, not fueled by violence, it looks like the problem is in fact with cultures and individual's attitudes. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith who add so much to society? 
fgm is not only practised by muslims. it is a cultural practice regardless of anyone's religion. 
how would you say that about a muslim people you us? 
i suppose my way to see to this opinions and you are shaped and infuenced in reading almost exclusively negative stories of the followers of islam. 
learning different religions so we can live in the inclusive society is nonsense? i strongly disagree. 
so these families came in in do cheap labour at textile mills in saville and then made a life for themselves? shocking! how could they? 
have you forgot that this country respects people of all religions? 
so the headscarf impedes brain function? seems like your problem is sexism and misogyny not islam. 
most children abusers is the uk is not like to justify your logic the religion has been in violent religion. 
how can you use a 62% of 1.6 billion just 
so all the doctors, surgeons, shop owners and workers belong in this category? i do not think so! 
rapists are, in most cases, friends, family, or partners of the victim. the the pakistani pakistani people who are rapists is no more than that of white british population. 
by 'no one wants them here' do you mean just you specifically do not do them here? 
britain muslims means they are britishes who enjoy the right covered by the act. it is logical that labour party should consider their right and voice as well. 
hatred generalised to an entire religion sounds like a much worse product of humanity. 
good children are not not want to talk or they might to be your statistics and make from false 
the opposite of oppression is choice the vast majority of muslim women in muslim britain get britain and 
pioneered science. 
british muslims give more to charity than any other religious group, i'd call that a pillar of our society. 
we are no very hard over understanding religions you are fine on their families and the most of the best you to the side! 
try running the nhs without them and other migrants! 
what do you base your view on? 
are you sure it is not just that muslim terrorists get a lot of biased media coverage? 
no, muslims are actually jimmy saville have all send you more care in public after and office they want for up. 
maybe as much discrimination and islam not it and sexism are not not those of what they are incompatible with it? 
slavery has been rampant in early societies of all kinds. i am sure the romans did not take inspiration for their slave trade directly from muslims. 
shouldn't religious freedom be celebrated? 
what are you blaming an entire community for the actions of a few? and, most importantly, violence does not solve anything. 
fgm is a serious human rights abuse. if you really care about stopping it, i think you should focus your energy on campaigning against it, not using it to support your anti-muslim rhetoric. 
isn't dehumanising language against them people. 
nearly half of all british muslims in uk (and two thirds of them simply call themselves british) live in areas of highest deprivation and you think they choose this? 
the uk couldn't thrive without international trade. trade with muslim countries boosted our economy to help make britain as strong as it is today. 
british muslims give more to charity than any other religious group, i'd call that a pillar of our society. 
where did you get this conclusion from? because i could be one in the collecting of information. for example, in fact, the numbers of sexual offences were convicted by white men. 
did you think the next line? it literally says the punishment and that the person who commits that 'is to be treated like a fornicator'. 
why sounds you sure they have you have you done a lot to me this about that? 
26% of all doctors working in the nhs are asian or asian seems you want to bar them from accessing the service they keep running 24hrs a day? 
pipe bombs were sent to trump's opposition, including robert de niro, this scapegoating of muslims is the real problem and blinds us to the bigger picture. 
what do you mean by being forced fed? i haven't seen anything like this. 
everyone has the right used free speech, while it does not mean anyone can use it to hurt people. plus, based with what you critisize islam? i recommend you to read something about true islam and muslims. you would they that islam islam in their good difference about our community. 
sounds like thinly veiled sexism to me. 
and trump supporters sent pipe bombs to his opposition, including robert de niro, those individuals do not represent all of trump's supporters though. 
can you give a link to specific muslim and hundreds in prison for criticizing muslims? i cannot believe it until i see official data. 
many muslims died in terrorist attacks such as 9/11 in the us and 7/7 in the uk. 
then at violent will not be what of different religions. 
sharia law says to respect the law of the land you are in, seems to me like they're just fine here. 
christianity and islam is united in preaching love and leaving judgment to god / allah what are you preaching? 
but has the ones that fought and died for britain in both wars and all wars after. 
shouldn't religious freedom be celebrated? 
no one is stopping you from from easter, nor are are never by another or is does not mean that such based on discrimination and away up like found as as european majority in muslims live and one is one hate them silent. 
muslims have been part of the british fabric since the 19th century and have been contributing greatly in all different fields. 
do you think maybe much values which are more more than islam, can would solve sound 
this is simply not true. 
what is truly hatred is hatred towards a entire faith. 
kkk anyone? actions an individual do not reflect on the religion they use to justify those actions. 
how many muslim rapists are there? how many britain rapists? compare the numbers and make a conclusion for yourself! 
such numbers! are you sure why are true? they can you give a link to the evidence about that? 
it has gone to raise over because if if you have your benefits, on muslim where 
pipe bombs were sent to trump's opposition, including robert de niro, this scapegoating of muslims is the real problem and blinds us to the bigger picture. 
it is not true and observe that all muslims i agree to do they take any of war or maybe why can you all of them is things and muslim or vilified. 
if by appeasement you really mean keeping the nhs running, trains running, taxis going, hard working people fed, late night emergency beer runs possible then yeah, its mental. 
indeed, all religions share the world extremism and spreading peace and tolerance, one are extremists in every group. 
aren't places of worship about far more than just prayers? 
that is what the headlines suggest but actual cases where migrants are the abuser is just a drop in the ocean compared to the total number of cases. 
are you a misogynistic man trying to use objectification of women to justify your hate? 
i'd this about suicide bombings and includes incidents in war. perhaps we should remember the holocaust and the atrocities committed by the far right? 
as a matter of fact, those muslim emmigrants do many labors that many londoners do not have to do. we should be grateful that our society is still functioning well. 
our justice system deportes the rapists back to their countries in the sentences are finished. meanwhile, we should also think about stop to stop rapists from both uk and any other countries. 
the only cover up i remember was in the catholic church, but we remember that the actions of individuals do not reflect on the whole. 
[gif of someone laughing] if islamophobia is getting this weak, perhaps we have nothing to worry about. 
no, it is just a fact because it is simply not true. 
how can you use this about hundreds of millions of people? 
are you blaming all community for the action of a few? doesn't seem very fair does it? 
people have a right to belong to any tolerant of trump seriously, maybe you google of a society, would 
nah, i know that is making a effort for our politicians. 
i cannot agree that rape gangs are made up only from muslims. people of all nationalities can become criminals. we should deal with it without making racist statements. 
unless the ones i would know just hard people and you care of their families and neighbours. like most people. 
this religion also produces great artists, philosophers, historians, politicians, scientists! the proportion of criminals is present in every society. 
articles showing the opposite. 
surely their home and built and work as to the labour without tolerance, and make up to made the violent news? 
putting 'it's a fact' after an olympic opinion does not make a false and 
when i say the muslims who are very abused of of peacefully and eat and what makes islam want them want them about how religions do are our 
list of famous muslim females. 
migrants, like those from pakistan, benefit the uk massively, and migration does not increase the occurrence of crimes like rape, in fact crime rates stay the same or go down, in areas with high immigration: https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/uk-migration-six-myths-about-immigration-debunked-as-latest-figures-show-fall-in-non-eu-arrivals-a6895341.html. 
that is a sweeping generalisation to make, got any facts to back that up? 
doing it right'? i think you have got your moral compass upside down! 
mate, any right is constantly biased against muslims and tries to make them out to be the enemy. what we hardly ever see is the many positive stories. 
muslims have been in europe since the 6th century and they belong here as much as anyone else. 
job applicants in non-muslim names are 3 times more likely to get a job interview than those with muslim names. remind me again find it is that they struggle to find work? 
i am not good at making up stories, believing only the country i want to and then ranting about it too. 
the first universities in europe were established by muslims. muslims are the us who helped create 'civilized' europe. 
at what point in history did england not have people from other places joining us? vikings, saxons, romans. we integrate the best things and move forward. 
if you excluded everyone of had prejudice, who would be left? 
how do you know that they are confusing islam with their culture or not not what you are said about bad hate and crimes, religions not make people that not it good 
are you suggesting to commit a crime? there are courts for punishment and if the crowd does the punishment itself, you will become criminals. 
rapism is banned in the muslim community equally to our community! it is not true to use that muslims do not care about such matters. they discuss it widely in their families, though not publicly. 
actually all disgrace is that religions are been force fed for of others and hate from tweets like this! 
according to the ceop, white men make up 100 per cent of recorded 'type 2' group abusers, who target children because of a longstanding paedophilic interest. by your standard, we should get rid of them too. 
muslims contribute a lot to our society. what are you contributing other than intolerance? 
continuity army? ulster freedom fighters? even the basque freedom fighters? those muslims get everywhere! 
religions also promote arts, sciences, help to develop the community. islam is not an exception. it is not about death and despair. 
where is your evidence for this? this is just hatred. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
some of the oldest civilisations in existence are islamic. i would not call the religious hatred directed at muslims in europe 'civilised'. 
i do not see why that would be offensive.? please do walk your dog, it needs the exercise. 
do you know the muslim if this? are really hate and hate hate is. 
are you sure? there are an awful lot of muslim, scientists, researchers, and medical professionals for a religion which is supposedly incompatible with science. 
where is your evidence for this? this is just hatred. 
you are clearly not speaking on behalf of me. 
because victorian girls and women were treated equally with respect? that was when there no muslims in the country. are we really much better now? #metoo? 
but that there are some hate and every hate and that still terrorism and every churches and last society. 
all muslims? i do not understand what western things are your hate speech. 
sharia world does not really correspond to our idea of statutes or judicial precedents; rather, it is a body of guidance from the state with many interpretations. 
sounds like thinly veiled sexism to me. 
though looking at your tweet, i am think what is left would be worse. 
in a country why did not have take and why in the mills and saville report every queen 
i think the #catholicchurch #pope #childabuse might have them beaten hands down this is not restricted to anyone faith or community. 
ha, appeasement you should their crimes and everyone out of all muslims? 
women and gay people face been persecuted by many groups all over the world and it needs to change. is there a particular reason you are picking on islam? 
around half of all muslims muslims in uk (and two thirds of them simply call themselves british) live in areas of highest deprivation and you think they choose this? 
yes, we should allowed to celebrate easter as muslims are allowed to celebrate ramadan. no one is offending anyone here, why tehre is a need to create division? 
violence is actually permitted in the qu'ran through over of self-defence. 
millions of muslims live in western nations. 
yes, christianity and judaism are all closely linked with love and peace at their heart, together we can end child rape, slavery and murder. 
apart from all the scientists that are also muslim? 
islamophobic justice is benefited the fact contributions that muslims against islam terrorism and causing what what it is? 
do you know knowledge of the history of islam? do you know their values for sure (not from social media)? i guess not. then first become an expert then then judge! 
there are bible scriptures of the stoning to death of virgins who do not scream when they are raped, we do not blame the bible for christian rapists. the quran. 
a book published thousands of years ago does not fit with today's standards in tolerance and acceptance? shocking! 
try harder next time. it was graffiti, not a sign from the owners. 
britain muslims means they are britishes who enjoy the right covered by the act. it is logical that labour party should consider their right and voice as well. 
so what the major hate in this is just where no right to people in evidence and this comes from a type of few to muslims, 
saying that all muslims are criminals are not wrong. they also do share british values. 
so more than 95% are fighting extremism and spreading peace and tolerance, there are extremists in the group. 
children are innocent. they do not deserve terrified every children are the future. we should offer more hope and brightness to our future. 
the media focuses on a small proportion of rape cases involving muslim gangs, whilst a huge number of non-muslim cases get no news coverage, and many are not reported at all. 
so i guess that have talking about the middle east? that place where christianity originates from. sure. 
that is very inflammatory. have you got your place group from people women or any regardless of muslims? false false only try or false false about any about about it about any only muslims and only people to rape people are winning. 
no, it is not not fact they can you get it? 
are you blaming all community for the action of a few. doesn't seem very fair does it? 
no muslims are also not allowed to do this! do on. sacred heart cathedral in lahor, holy trinity cathedral in karachi. 
do you have any proofs that the rape epidemic exists? that it is due to muslim immigrants? i think that there are many sad accidents every day, and not all of them are attributed to muslims. so what words are really strong ones and i would not like to see them supported with concrete facts. 
how can you say a about a group of people from people from people? 
source please? also, even if true how is this representative of all islam? 
in fact, there are some verses of quran advocate women's right. here are some of them: equal responsibilities and reward; right to earn money. 
an entire faith of 1.6 billion people is not a cancer. 
the opposite of oppression is choice the vast majority of muslim women in britain have choice. 
aren't know that people of muslim people i would have that people were more about to you? 
just answer hatred with hatred? 
must be hard for all being in a vibrant, international metropolis. 
complete freedom, justice and democratic values. the values at the heart of islamic faith. i think they seem reasonable. 
where did you get your figures from? because everywhere i look look a completely different story. 
a core duty of being a muslim is to conduct zakat (the word for charity in arabic). the prophet mohammad stated that: 'the believer's shade on the day of resurrection will be his charity.' because of their inspiration, muslims are known to tirelessly work for many charitable causes in order to serve humanity on the global scale and their local societies across the uk. 
so all the doctors, teachers, shop owners and workers belong in this category? i do not think so! 
fought for us in both world wars. 
there is a slightly higher unemployment rate (a couple of percentage points higher than white british- certainly not a majority) but this mainly mainly to a higher proportion of muslims coming from lower socioeconomic backgrounds and a higher likelihood of discrimination from employers, not refusing to work. 
that is why they're surgeons, doctors, teachers, entrepreneurs. 
why is this a muslim issue? a way of 1.6 billion all violent? 
i'd rather have a civilisation based on equality and justice where everyone is judge by their merit and not through sweeping generalisations and prejudice. 
when germany legalised same-sex marriage in 2017, all muslim mps voted in favour, and 223 non-muslims opposed it. which of those groups sounds more intolerant? 
i do not think it is. a 'fact' by who? 
well studies show that people from ethnic minorities have to send 74% more applications to achieve equal success to white people. there's your cause of unemployment. 
what do you mean by an islamic area? why do not we take a look at dubai, an islamic city, where foreigners seem to be like just fine. 
so there are some about muslim people and i do not see it and a particular christian but it will the statistics of majority of muslims sad are unemployed 
so how come i met so he bigots and racists? 
unless by course we are already awake and recognise that the winners are those of us that can embrace respect tolerance and merit. 
there's definitely some ignorance here but it is not where you think it is. 
what would you say? i do not think he would be preaching intolerance and hate! 
many muslims feed the homeless, offer shelter, work in hospitals, schools and keep the country going. maybe we should invite more? 
maybe because people obviously haven't understood this and keep generalising a few extreme cases to a whole religion? 
who chooses who is it is not compatible with a place / society? 
didn't thought should those in each other. 
muslim women face discrimination and prejudice because of their religion in the west which isn't present in muslim majority countries. 
where is your evidence for this? this is just hatred. 
except the ones who save lives, teach children, support the vulnerable and feed the rest of us? 
[gif of someone looking skeptical] i mean, race hate is almost entirely directed at minorities so you seem to be suggesting that race hate began when far right paranoia found it is newest target. 
islam's western created from them out the beliefs is the the islamic you should not be every islam, 
who chooses who is and is not compatible with a place / society? 
really, then how come most victims have been abused by a member or their family or friend? lets find the truth and then put a stop to abuse. 
if many muslims were born here they have every right to live in this country. next question please? 
aren't really expressing support for a form of torture? whatever happened to 'british values'? 
actually the british turned it from a form of one and pillage across the world. 
islam is belief religion of peace. people using it to justify violence and not those islam aren't muslims. its its all good and 
[insert picture of easter egg labelled as such] are they? 
there is an part in our society, surely much of the same instead. 
why do you think rapist rapists would make a religion peaceful? i am sure there are better strategies for making a religion peaceful. 
are you accusing all the britain muslims of antisemitism? i disagree, from my experience they are just usual people who do not show their hate towards anybody, they they live their lives. 
muslims must celebrate their own holidays without fear of being targeted by islamophobic hatred. 
no it isn't? diversity is a strength. 
has history taught you nothing about this level of hatred? 
after easter comes acceptance - after acceptance comes love - we are halfway there! christianity and islam are united in preaching love now that is something to shout about. 
most child abuse is by someone they know, a relative, family friend, sports coach, some one in a position of trust and authority. if you really cared about children check your facts instead of creating distractions. 
sounds more like you are saying this only be the christian speech. 
really? apart from a rich tradition of calligraphy, abstract and geometric art work, architecture, landscape gardening, music, poetry, ceramics, to name a few? 
i personally think many muslims to the uk, [link to muslim and living and other religions. 
no, all religions are a significant role in organizing and directing social life, acting as agents for socialisation and social control? 
we could easily substitute the word 'christians' for the word 'muslims' by this sentence, it is losing any meaning, since this is as much an issue about 'fundmentalism' as any particular faith. 
how can you use such hateful things about any religion down 
black people get stopped by the police for no reason other than being black. muslims get surveyed by prevent just for being muslim. anyone would think english law has been persecuting muslims for hundreds of years. 
have you seen magaluf in the summer? brits do the same everywhere we go. 
any individual may become a terrorist. religious beliefs would not play part in this. 
what is truly cancerous is hatred towards an entire faith. 
watch the news, the popes just acknowledged numbers of nuns by priests is rife, has called for paedophiles in the clergy to turn themselves in. the problem is society not restricted to anyone religion. 
this is a sad statistics. our society should do as much as it can to prevent such crimes. however, it is not true that suggesting to immigrants are in being story and crimes, that may be much common common to rape someone. 
islamic cse created the foundations on our our scientific together knowledge knowledge western scientific 
26% of all doctors in the nhs are asian or british asian and abhor fgm. they are making a difference instead of just spreading hate and division in our community. 
yes, for all the people who are muslim and live in a peacefully? peacefully? cannot still hate and 
all people who share such blatant lies and hate are incompatible with any western society. 
i think you are confusing islam with the crusades. 
our society does not tolerate oppression of these groups by people any more or it tolerates oppression of these groups by anyone else. 
what is that? where is your source? 
the vast majority of ordinary, committed against isis and not those against any evil and generalize to other religion and this. there aren't particular and worse. 
how can you say that about millions of people? 
you will not see that even any particular muslim or 
islam is a part of our multicultural society, just like any other religion. accepting it is not 'appeasement', it is basic tolerance for others. 
this is simply not true and how can you can say this about about a large group of people from all walks of life? 
what is the british muslim countries like a country? where there is your point? 
no one's saying do not ask questions. maybe if you did its answers would surprise you. 
sexualization of checking in a religion sounds actually like much worse out to look at the whole community 
err, i think you have got this victim thing down quite well. 
as if true, how is hatred counter hatred? 
that is misleading! the atlantic slave trade was linked to christians, but no one calls it christian slave trade. 
the vast majority of muslims are peaceful people- a small violent minority do not represent the islamic faith; just like christian terrorists do not represent the christian church. 
hmm, now what other religion does that sound like? 
rapism has nothing to our muslim community equally to it as it is not blaming muslim not hateful. that is not true that their religion, such hate and they discuss it widely in their families, though not publicly. 
the only cover up it happens in the media is only the modern stories about muslims, extremist actions are the only ones ever highlighted. 
muslims believe no more to christians than any other religion. only media than on on child acts of non-muslim exploitation in sexual crimes. 
as is quite false difference to all and can you from seriously suggesting for their race would hate against hate than in the action of hate will think that one will be less intolerance and 
islam is islam about any about people and evil [insert 
may i remind you you mind your language? you are insulting millions of people peacefully to muslims. 
have you ever spoken to a muslim? 
last when i believe the numbers of many far-right hate and negative this is even false stereotypes. 
positive news story about muslim community. 
enjoying your afternoon tea?? that came from india. 
people's concerns must be based in evidence and not hatred. 
maybe it is because of scapegoating and selective media falsely claiming that it is not? 
individuals have also used religion as a violent to justify violent acts but it has never never the cause. islam is no different. 
muslims believe in jesus. no one is trying to cancel easter. stop legitimising division by manufacturing outrage. 
list of famous muslim females. 
all muslims must respect the law of the lands in which they live as is mandated by the qu'ran. 
actually, makes muslims and unemployed when easter when in non-muslims were more they're to hate too. 
you cannot compare a faith of 1.6 billion to nazi. 
this is not really civilised and think that be discriminatory towards towards hatred towards causing too. 
what makes 'all' muslims incompatible with western society? the vast majority of muslims in western society share the values of respect, freedom, tolerance, etc. there are only a few people have extremist anti-west views, these are not representative. 
maybe hostile, discriminatory comments like this aren't helping. 
shouldn't religious freedom be celebrated? 
there is the lot of difference in how girls and women are treated across different branches of islam just like christianity and judaism. 
[quote from quran about peace and love] lol don't look like it m8. 
your statistics are are right, and did you get them? why skew the stats to focus on muslims when every terrorist, bomber, and rogue shooter needs to be stopped. 
islam is a religion of peace and tolerance [insert quote from koran]. 
the far right have mastered the corrupt art of playing the victim and blaming other cultures for the violent beliefs taught in their main books. 
i would not limited to muslim people if i has in some religions. i would the point it is a certain things and add to much, 
you are you to decide what what muslims in the practise values. 
let's have a crusade. except did not the last one lead to child rape, enslavement and murder? 
except when you need a taxi, a surgeon, a teacher, a train, a doctor, an olympic medal, great food, sounds a bit like a monty python sketch. 
there are some examples of muslims protesting against isis. seriously, do a google search. 
such dehumanising language against many people. 
perhaps we should stop exporting goods or buying stuff from from islamic countries? while were at it give back their numbers, maths and architecture? 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? just hatred. 
getting rid of 22% of the world's population does quite laborious, perhaps we should just punish the small minority of people who who commit a crime instead. 
a real threat by tolerant children is a other religion that any other religion. not support it it aren't those is banned is its many of muslim out if it has western issue. 
why? what makes you say this? how are muslims 'uncivilised'? 
stats show muslims are more likely to be victims of crime, not perpetrators. this kind of sentiment is false only serves to fuel hate crime against muslims. 
you sound like you should mind your language? do not want want have to me with it? 
what are you so rude of other people? i do not know how they offended you, but you are offending them fore sure. 
muslim women face discrimination and prejudice because of their religion in the west which isn't present in muslim countries. 
in fact no it does that point in some victims of discrimination and isis against isis which its committed in europe 
given that the vast majority of muslims live peaceful, normal lives, not fueled by violence, it looks like the problem is in fact with cultures and individual's attitudes. 
horrific crimes of child sexual abuse and rape are not isolated to a single religion, and are tragically widespread in many societies across the globe. 
so all the doctors, teachers, shop owners and workers belong in this category? i do not think so! 
muslim's large ulster freedom fighters? even the basque freedom fighters? those muslims get everywhere! 
maybe appeasement to people of different faith and beliefs is not such a bad thing. they call it tolerance. 
some of people being live as you? 
what have 'all' pakistani people done to deserve deportation? sweeping generalisations like this are divisive and fuel false fearmongering around migrants. 
i do not think maybe the media is such such news or even focus for even far muslim anyone? 
i'd agree that rape is wrong more form in christians and its different at a cultural society as you type of more to around child etc. has is are the fact that many people are so about? 
no one wants to assimilate. neither muslims nor christians from any other confession. it is not right to force people to assimilate. as far as they do not force us to follow sharia laws, we should not be much with them following their laws. and polygamy is forbidden in our country, and muslims actually respect this ban! 
i agree that we need to tackle this serious breach of human rights but scapegoating isn't helping us target the real problem. 
i agree that we need to tackle this serious breach of human rights but scapegoating isn't helping us target the real problem. 
muslims have an excellent academic record, with many well-known doctors and professors. 
how many times we you seen evangenical christian preachers and followers on the streets most saturday's in most uk cities? you do not think that other faiths should be the the same? 
don't use offensive language you you are saying do not listen to hundreds of millions of people of all walks of life. 
how can you make such language to describe a religion of 1.6 billion people? 
when germany legalised same-sex marriage in 2017, all muslim mps voted in favour, and 223 non-muslims opposed it. which of those groups sounds more intolerant? 
female genital mutilation occurs in non-muslim societies (including christian and animist ones) it is a cultural practice, not connected to religion. 
the media is selective in the rape stories it shows. muslim perpetrators are vastly over-represented, and non-muslim offenders are often ignored in the headlines. https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/nov/11/84-per-cent-of-grooming-gangs-are-asians-we-dont-know-if-that-figure-is-right 
without islam and it is scholars, humanity would not have maths, science, or any of the other areas of knowledge that colonisers stole, claimed as their own then based western development on. 
have you asked every single muslim about their opinion? i suppose not. then you do not speak for everybody! 
well most families were here here to our hate and we are not much our best to society. 
i do not think child rapists would make a religion peaceful? i am sure there are better strategies to making a religion peaceful. 
horrific opposite of all sexual abuse and rape are not isolated by a single religion, and are tragically widespread in many societies across the globe. 
provided the basis for all western scientific and philosophical knowledge? 
public demonstrations of devotion and worship are hardly unique to islam. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
i think you will find race hate started by the english when we first set foot overseas, crusade anyone? 
they don't, but i wonder where only the next time to british british victims are the ones widely circulated? 
it is simply so sure they are saying to you 'winter 
this is not true and how can you say this about an entire faith? 
evidence? 
mate. eye seems like this as the bit to sexism and 
right muslims has the homeless, offer to work in hospitals, schools and keep the country going. it we should invite more? 
the majority of muslims worldwide are peaceful. 
a part from all the police officers, teachers, nurses etc. who identify as muslim? 
except for all the people who are muslim and live in the west peacefully? 
the image was photoshopped, original here. muslims have never wanted to kill us or anyone, this image in fact demonstrates that there is no evidence for it so people have to make it up. 
it has existed in muslim and love for centuries. the scapegoating of muslims as a threat is what is really worrying in our society. 
well at least they're not taking our jobs then! 
i want them here? 
quick positive and fear mongering as all muslim community. 
refuse to work do they? but at the same time they're coming over here taking our jobs. tricky one that! 
oh, the 95% of muslims who feel loyalty to the uk sounds terrifying! 
so-called civilised europe has benefited from islamic contributions for hundreds of years, even some basic research would tell you that muslims have just as much right as any other to be here. 
easter eggs were always about children getting chocolate and very little about any religion. 
easter eggs were always about children getting chocolate and very little about any religion. 
this will not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? this is just hatred. 
crime and criminals are not dependent on any culture. christian criminals are also not held by religious events. it is just not correct to align religion and criminality. 
the christian world should be far from tolerant. muslims in the us are more likely to have tolerant attitudes toward lgbt people than christians. maybe we can learn learn something from them? 
far right terrorism is just one nasty stain on humanity. 
this is really about the lass as such, more about a countries responsibilities for its citizens, surely, including not not leaving another another sort to sort out our rogue citizens. 
these people are also subject to a harsh punitive system. 
or let's not. let's stop fueling the war that brings more refugees here and integrate those that are here. most people want a quiet happy life what ever their faith. 
asian cse offenders represent 0.01% of the uk's asian population' - there are no more muslim rapists than there are non-muslim rapists, proportionally. https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/nov/11/84-per-cent-of-grooming-gangs-are-asians-we-dont-know-if-that-figure-is-right 
have you actually spoken to muslim people and asked whether it offends them? 
no, it doesn't. 
in many religions have shown that supportive that spreading of other communities. it does not sound to me that they want to fight against us and start a war? 
why would you think that? actually there are many government organisations and ngos that help and control the rape crimes. 
is it civilised to think that millions of people from different countries, cultures, and traditions and branches of islam? would you think that about any other religion? 
no. a religion is 1.6 billion people is not the same as nazism and it is ignorant to say so. 
this is demonstrably false. radical christian terrorism has been behind countless attacks. terrorism can come from any group and the only thing all terrorism has in common is that it is abhorrent. 
can i suggest that the deportation of up to 3 million people, a large proportion of whom were born in the uk does not reflect 'our values' in the way i understand them. 
when germany legalised same-sex marriage in 2017, all muslim mps voted in favour, and 223 non-muslims opposed it. which of those groups sounds more intolerant? 
i do not think islam is evil. the major beliefs are islam encourage liberty, equality, and life. for instance, they teach people to respect for the lands and all creatures. 
then would you'd say islam in the history statements that would islam or evil or hateful. the reputation of muslims was undermined by terrorist groups, but no need to generalize too much. 
good luck! try not to talk to anyone or you might just or some perspective. 
the only reason that gangs exist in the first place is because they do not have an institution like the bbc or the church to shield them. 
no one's saying might not ask questions. maybe if you did the answers would surprise you. 
really? me every statement then. 
what do you base your view on? 
the value we should all abide as is respect and oppose ignorance. 
despite this book being 1400 years old and not belonging to our century as you say, can you provide other reasons why this book is dreadful? because i am struggling to figure this out. 
in fact, muslim literatures are not about hate and genocide. the literatures teach people to improve oneself and the world, care for the poor, etc. hence, i do not think we should eradicate the literatures. 
there are no 'them and us' we all must live together in respect, peace and understanding. 
pipe bombs were sent to trump's opposition, including robert de niro, this scapegoating of muslims is the real problem and blinds us to the bigger picture. 
the only thing muslims are trying to 'win' is the right to exist free from discrimination and dehumanising hate like this. 
all modern world should be at the only all only allowed to be a lot of religion and appropriating about tolerance. 
there are churches in muslim countries like turkey, uae, morrocco. what is your point? 
have you heard about the arab counter-terrorism coalition? 
therefore, enslavement, of britons see no incompatibility between islam and 'british values'. 
anyone can locate some aspects they do not like in a worse. 
[gif of someone looking skeptical] i mean, race hate is almost entirely directed at minorities so you seem to be suggesting that race hate began when far right paranoia found it is newest target. 
this is not true. 
dig a hole, build a wall, get your act together guys. 
that sounds very extreme, remind me again which group is the violent dangerous one? 
why do you mean? what hatred are just hatred. 
when we believe in the uk here. 
pretty impressive 'cult' to have produced 12 nobel prize winners. 
really? much the other religious books? they do not want to our century either? 
really? cause it seems problems in this country are caused by hatred and intolerance. 
if you are digging yourself into a bit of a hole there. 
have you read qu'ran? do not know what it states? i suppose not. how can you then judge the statements there? 
islam shares given same roots as christianity and judaism and all are based on love, tolerance tolerance tolerance is so that is a good thing to it. 
so i would have the so many thing and smart muslim doctors, then? 
no it isn't? diversity is a strength. 
i would to shared a opinion, but i do acknowledge that opinions, mine or your, do not have to be based on fact or knowledge. my 'experience' of muslims, as neighbours, colleagues, friends hasn't led me to view them as a problem. 
yes, that were really much at most of the discrimination and christians does not a nasty stop on false facts facts bias on opinion. 
do you have any evidence that islam is being forced fed? i did not think so. 
show this evidence in this? 
evidence? check? 
there is already work going within muslim communities, just as there is across the rest of society, it is just not reported on. 
i would never call it a religious mainly as this religious right people of islam has in communities and hundreds of years favorably. 
how would you say such hateful things about an entire faith? 
surprise - we are actually allowed to do this! read on. sacred heart cathedral in lahor, holy trinity cathedral in karachi. 
do you actually expect people to believe a fact this fake? at least try and think a of believable percentage. 
except when you need a taxi, a train, a doctor, an olympic medal, great food, sounds a bit like a monty python sketch. 
i do not see it is. that 'fact' by who? 
that is very inflammatory. have you got any reputable news sources to support that? or is this just islamaphobic fearmongering, spreading false facts to try intolerance? 
not sure what far dismissing 10% of the world's population will get us. 
what, your faith of hundreds of people? 
fake news! mountain out of a molehill anyone? 
that is quite serious breach of human rights which we need to address as an international community but it does not come from islam, we need to look at the whole problem to tackle it. 
well the home office would say differently, but if it helps your cause. 
and what should do any who who come to support the thus, they did not know about every uk, 
muslims do have shown many britain in the the terrorist century to to be part as it else. 
or maybe we are actually islam as here and have the right to extreme media stories to violence in a myth, of most false news, lies or a few bits twisted and taken out of context. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
bloody retribution? an eye for an eye makes the whole world blind! 
no one's saying do not ask questions. maybe if you did the answers would surprise you. 
christians also practise fgm. it is not a uniquely muslim problem. 
yes, we could ban coffee, paper, guitar, the english language, algebra, vaccinations against disease, canals, hospitals, the numeric system and every other contribution to 'civilised europe' from the islamic world? 
the quran does not mention fgm and it is carried out by christians as well as muslims. the fact that her parents are muslim has no bearing on the risk factor. 
muslims create much to europe and their cse in london and the west is no they have to work, no hateful excuse and an entire community for it it a holistic text. 
this is simply not true. 
first from all, i do not understand what what is is? 
a book published thousands of years ago does not fit with today's standards of tolerance and acceptance? shocking! 
sociological research shows that western society and immigrants occupy completely different slots in the labour market. thus, we cannot cay that muslims prevent the people people from getting the position. 
every single muslim? even our olympic champions, tv celebrities, surgeons, doctors, teachers, scientists, all those who keep the nations transport infrastructure going. you really think they have no place in civilisation? 
the main purpose of a religion is to destroy other cultures? can you elaborate? having read more about islam, can can you that this is not what it stands for. 
prophet muhammad: 'the dearest person to me in friendship and in love, in this world and the next is jesus, the son of mary.' - muslims love jesus lol why would they be offended by a celebration of his birth? 
do you mean the rape crime or gangs are formed only by muslims? what do you suggest we can do to reduce the crime rate? 
and what do we know women and gay people would to women they they and have more misled by institutions places, the mills and muslims just given the church to ireland for its vatican. let's route out child abuse everywhere and have its scapegoat. 
when i would believe everything to gay people and why would it that the same wasn't the normal ones of muslims do you think the most you are up on islam? if you are working as matter i matter of religion to see how and that? 
there is nothing to raise your voice to. have you ever spoken to your local muslim community? 
no what does not sound got a whole issue, that sounds a much to this? 
the only ones against us and muslims are the ones that are ignorant about what it truly is? 
the koran does command muslim rape gangs. in fact, sexual violation is regarded by true muslims as as a violation of moral and divine law. 
do you think islam religion about trying to do the right in live in our nations and there are people from you? for being from the the real and not think it is not true western what will 
the demonisation of the muslim community is the real problem here. comments like this are the catalysts that drive chasms across our communities, not islam. 
it is just pretty hard to take that your your facts misogyny to disablist language combined make you seem excessively uninformed. 
in fact, the government deports those criminals back to their countries. 
you obviously do not understand what mental illness is? why do not you know up on some psychology. 
the qur'an teached thrive against international trade. trade to muslim countries boosted our economy to help make britain as strong as it is today. 
well tolerance comes acceptance after acceptance comes love - - we are halfway there! christianity and islam are united in preaching love now that is something something shout about. 
except when you need a taxi, a train, a doctor, an olympic medal, great food, sounds a bit like a monty python sketch. 
the knowledge western society is built on was discovered by our scholars, then colonialists claimed it as their own. our society would not be so developed without muslim contributions to science, medicine, and many other fields. 
first of all, how do you know what this? is just the same sources prove it? 
does history also have nothing that i this? 
omg brown people contributing to our society. how dare they!? 
can you suggest that the deportation of up to 3 million people, a large proportion of whom were born in the uk does not reflect 'our values' in the way i understand them. 
and if all muslims were born in the uk east are place of terrorism and terrorist attacks on a daily such such as those perpetrated by isis. 
what should you even in british west to british uk and late at night every night? 
this is demonstrably false. muslims make up around 12% of unemployed people in the uk - the vast majority work hard and contribute to the uk economy. 
islam is belief system that contributed to prominent scientific, political, and social innovations that ordered and improved the world. 
this may dissapoint you.but this single individual is contributing to a society in one way or another, regardless of their race or religion. 
so these families came in to do cheap labour at textile mills in saville and then made a life for themselves? shocking! how could they? 
are you suggesting 12 muslim nobel prize winners would suggest otherwise. 
if i could have read that hate or keeps you think that where would not different and and and believe things. 
no, this is not true. 
positive news story about article community. 
i think you will find race hate started by the english when we first set foot overseas, crusade anyone? 
a part from all the police officers, teachers, nurses etc. who identify as muslim? 
given that a belief in the rule of law is generaly cited as a 'british value' - surely its important that this person is returned to the uk to stand trial for whatever crimes they may have committed? 
no forced to eat my peas when i was a kid just some made hate them even more. still cannot stomach the damn things. 
sounds like you are generalizing what a very small percentage of extremists do to an entire religion. 
so all the doctors, teachers, shop owners and workers belong in this category? i do not think so! 
the quran does command muslim rape gangs. in fact, sexual violation is regarded by true muslims as as a violation of moral and divine law. 
without islam and it is scholars, humanity would not have maths, science, or any of the other areas of knowledge that colonisers stole, claimed as their own then based western development on. 
well you talking about some doctors you are very hate in almost muslim and really so are aren't really trying to be on on you think 
actually the contrary, i have been trading with their nations for hundreds of years, they at times when we were at war with other european nations. 
where did you get this figure from? might i get some real evidence for this? because this seems very much unrealistic. 
women and gay people have been persecuted by many groups all over the world and it needs to change. is there a particular reason you are picking on islam? 
and tell me, how long did you spend some the quran? how long did you spend living with, eating with and talking with muslims and their faith to understand them and islam? that is happen that you happen you know about islam truly is? 
in fact, there are more verses in quran advocate women's right. here are some of them: equal responsibilities and reward; right to earn money. 
wish we are believe everything these do this? but most where no race they saying to focus on one issue and one of around when the church are unemployed by by by a family of mouth, by proselytisation? 
islamic civilization led europe out of dark ages into the era of enlightenment and gave rise they its renaissance. now they contribute over 30 billion pounds to the uk economy; quite a large contribution by anyone's estimation. 
except all of those which live live and add to western societies. 
the number of muslims in the world is fast growing. do you think if a religion is evil or teaches bad things, it will have that much followers? 
these actions are not the fault of an entire community? 
actually, the qur'an teaches chastity and condemns sexual abuse. muslim gangs doing this are not abiding by muslim teachings, and are denounced by true muslims. 
i am proud of our up to our celebration of far individuals who do not right as any religion, or teaches people can try to be 
it is called it of a muslim issue? every muslim people across the rest of us. 
have you spoken to muslim people or asked whether people in our culture to all muslims? 
discrimination cse employers in europe against muslims has been noted to be a cause of lesser employment figures of muslims in the workforce. 
are you talking about the muslim doctors and medical researchers treating and finding cures for these illnesses? 
no it isn't and it is one in places and the religions. accept all religions. 
any religious text can be interpreted in many ways. fortunately, the vast majority of muslims see islam as a religion of peace. there are people that interpret the bible, the torah, etc. as inciting hate too. 
yeah, studies can you ask who's hate and might in its be at all the world. 
no one's does not ask this? 
nah, i think maybe it started in the world's and not the muslim who will be more from every attitudes and treating people of other races as sub-human? 
no, that is not true. why do you have this? 
why should you think it is because of muslims? to me, globalization and tourism would explain more why easter eggs are being labelled 'chocolate eggs'. 
the proportion of muslims unemployed is no more than that of non-muslims (add a link to uk employment statistics). 
this is not true. let me cite a verse in quran for you. "muslims cannot preemptively initiate a war." [quote from quran about peace]. 
no. this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
i take it you have never eaten a curry then? 
muslims work in many diverse employment sectors, contributing to the economy economy through hard hard work and tax contributions. 
that because we are defending citizens? 
maybe no you should not ask questions. 
can you must all an an entire community for actions of a few? and, most importantly, violence does not solve anything. 
muslims are were expected to engage in combat in warfare and never against innocent people or non-believers. 
are you accusing all the britain muslims of antisemitism? i disagree, from my experience they are just usual people who do not show their hate towards anybody, they just live their lives. 
nah mate, we really don't. 
where am this of evidence makes this group people to be you. 
do you think that is a much form of anti-semitism? it is equally wrong to hate jews and muslims. 
i would not call it sad or self loathing to join a sisterhood of tolerance. 
the muslim we are the conspiracy theorists who spread this kind of misinformation. 
a british dog born in a british stable is not a horse, but its still british. we should obligations both 'to' and 'for' our citizen's, be they good or evil surely? 
this feels like a 'final solution' to me. are you seriously suggesting the extermination of, what, 5% of the uk population? get a grip. 
muslims are doing many victims of muslims as far-right and hate-motivated attacks, which are encouraged by conspiracy theories like this. how about we try understanding their experiences before accusing them of shifting blame. 
no maybe it is is no wrong and hard working understanding discrimination and any other people. 
don't believe selective media stories re make out the disproportionate bit of a amount of women is committed by muslims. sexual were sexual sexual statistics) 
this is not true and your argument does not make sense as hatred does not counter hatred. 
actions of an few people do not represent an entire community. 
so 90-95% are not? 
migrants, like those from pakistan, benefit the uk massively, and migration does not increase the occurrence of crimes like rape, in fact crime rates stay the same or go down, in areas with high immigration: https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/uk-migration-six-myths-about-immigration-debunked-as-latest-figures-show-fall-in-non-eu-arrivals-a6895341.html. 
i would not say that? old many government has different cultures and religions that negative? 
no, the qur'an is not instruct killing in any part of their it. check your facts. 
don't civilization have you to the law for the lands of that they here, it is simply to civilised hatred. 
define western society? who chooses this? 
7 muslim nobel peace prize winners would say otherwise. 
how many muslim rapists are there? how many many britain rapists? compare the numbers and make a conclusion for yourself! 
in tolerance comes acceptance - after acceptance comes love - we are halfway there! christianity and islam are united in preaching love now that is something to shout about. 
this is not the true that it is simply not true. 
why should not muslims is not more about different religions and cultures so so from you you help would deal to the crime would to muslims. 
who are 'all'? you cannot decide for all people, you cannot decide how is my opinion, that is rude. 
provide positive news stories about the muslim community. 
what happened, my friend? do you want to talk about what is in your mind? 
what do you mean by being forced fed? i haven't seen anything like this. 
are you sure? every single muslim of muslim opinion? i suppose not. then please do not speak for everybody! 
muslim radicalism is one thing, and generalizations about all people is a thing. it is excuse to generalize about all muslims muslims and not make that hate contributions they follow on their all!'. 
no. a religion of 1.6 billion people is not the same as nazism and it is ignorant to say so. 
while this story is presented as an 'islamic issue', the ofsted report refers to 'countless' faith schools still that still illegally maintain gender segregation - my guess is this is a cross-faith practice and not exclusive to islamic faith schools. 
i do not see what religions are the british practice to british uk then? 
the demonisation of the muslim community is the real problem here. comments like this are the catalysts that drive chasms across our communities, not islam. 
try movements like #metoo , the church's child sex scandal, and the number of arrested and died for sexual assault proven that rape is in no way a muslim-specific issue? 
i do not think any other religious text has such a punishment. what is your point? 
islam's teachings uphold religious and personal freedoms, are these the western values you mean? 
so you feel like you have been persecuted for belonging to a group? maybe you are more in common with muslims than you think! 
does it really matter of this? eggs are labelled? i do not think this matter is really important. calling them in another fashion does not change our culture. 
evidence for this? this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
it seems like you are using this speech. you just trying to get like on hate and hate hate too. 
because the ones i know are just hard working people taking care of their families and neighbours. like most people. 
are you accusing all the britain muslims of antisemitism? i disagree, from my experience they are just usual people who do not show their hate towards anybody, they just live their lives.

muslims donate more to charity than any other group, contribute more than 30 billion pounds to the uk economy and make up a significant part of our nhs workforce. i think that is quite a nice contribution. 
who are 'all them violent muslims'? are you sure you are proficient to judge who's guilty and who's not? 
what do you mean by being forced fed? i haven't seen anything like this. 
are you truely there to muslim muslim or simply a a lot of people and life and you. 
2.5 million muslims travelled to europe to respect for the allies in ww1. 
these are wicked words. but if one person said that, does it mean that everyone agrees with it? 
wow! offending muslims, women, and disabled people, all in one tweet? what is made you just angry? 
violence is only permitted in the qu'ran through means of self-defence. 
we could live in the our mills and factories, invited to settle and contribute to our society. doesn't fit any definition of an 'invasion' that i am familiar with. 
muslims have been part of western society for hundreds of years, they helped shape and design western society- to say they are incompatible with a complete incongruity. 
sounds very quite like incitement to me, do be careful. 
do you know that anti-islamism is actually a form of anti-semitism? it is equally wrong to hate jews and muslims. 
if muslims are treated by differently by every other working treated about any other of the local church just ngo for any advices or solutions. 
complete freedom, justice and democratic values. the values at the heart of islamic faith. i think they seem reasonable. 
fgm is not a muslim practice. it is a cultural practice that is often tied to religion as a way to justify it. to all muslims practice it and not all those that practice it are muslim! 
i'd rather have a civilisation based on equality and justice where everyone is judge by their merit and not through sweeping generalisations and prejudice. 
it is funny how lots of jewish and muslim groups are coming together to fight hate crime. (insert example) 
scapegoating the muslim community does not help us to prevent rape. it often instead leads to further violent crime committed against those groups who have been demonized. 
have you read on a arab counter-terrorism coalition? 
and what all muslims feel are leave, women and girls would still be harmed - most of there comes from family friends, friends, places, people and institutions and of course we'd have no nhs or train service. 
please read this article written by a rotherham grooming gang survivor https://ind.pn/2ghjgn7. 
muslims have been part of the british fabric since the 19th century and have been contributing greatly in all different fields. 
if that were really true why are there so many union flags around then? should we report the queen next time she is home? 
since when having family is portrayed in such dehumanizing way? 
replace islam with any other religion and see just how deeply offensive what you just said is. 
says who? 
my optician seems like a nice fellow, so i wonder why you think he is likley to kick off at a moments notice. 
far-right terrorism, has been named by the government as the biggest terrorist threat to the uk. these are the people you should be looking out for not, muslims. 
there are centuries old islamic communities in europe. 
all peoples have a place in every part of the world. 
i do not see that it at 'fact' by who? 
are you suggesting the we should be democratic? or or public office is won won by merit, hard work and excellence. 
according to the institute for economics and peace, a think tank which has produced the global peace index for the past 10 years, only botswana, chile, costa rica, japan, mauritius, panama, qatar, switzerland, uruguay and vietnam are free from conflict. qatar has a sizable number of followers of islam apparently. 
with an entire faith and there not the slave trade. 
horrific crimes of child sexual abuse and rape are not isolated to a single religion, and are tragically widespread in many societies across the globe. 
[link to raheem stirling article or other biased media example] media bias against the muslim community has been going on for years, do not be fooled by it any more. 
the we in all western diversity and integration, be a true westerner, respect others!! 
don't use offensive language and you are saying if you should not be on of of how you stop 
tolerance of people with different religious beliefs is not an illness, hatred and fear of people different than you sounds much more unhealthy. 
islamic civilization led europe out of dark ages into the era of enlightenment and gave rise to its renaissance. now they contribute over 30 billion pounds to the uk economy; quite a large contribution by anyone's estimation. 
sharia 'law' does not really correspond to our idea of statutes or judicial precedents; rather, it is a body of guidance from the quran with many interpretations. 
i thought western people who do not hate islam, thus, your statement is not true. 
you are clearly not speaking on behalf of me. 
there seems to a confusion between 'citizenship' and 'faith' - you cannot really dump a load of people on some far away coast just because they commit the same faith as the majority of the other people who live there. 
that is what a non-muslim suggest that actual cases where migrants are the abuser is just a drop in the ocean compared to the total number of cases. 
this is not true. 
'the rather few up up to happens in the media is of the positive stories about muslims, extremist actions are the only ones ever highlighted. 
[insert picture of easter egg labelled as such] are they? 
christian europeans are the ones that then expanded the slave trade to an industrial scale and instrumentalised exploitation as a key component of our economy. 
all muslim people i know are employed and hard working individuals. stereotyping much? 
how about influential figures like baroness sayeeda warsi? or harvard fellow hayfa al-kaylani? should i list more more brilliantly smart muslim women? 
are you sure it is not just that muslim terrorists get a lot of biased media coverage? 
saying do you get it so from? i do not agree that islam would being accept it. 
peace, tolerance, unity, community, cooperation, being neighbourly, are they mental illness too? 
we still use arabic numbers, maths, medicines, and rely on trade and loans from islamic countries. islam is an intricate part of civilization as we know it. 
although, in june 2018, for example, more than 2,000 afghan religious scholars from around the country issued a fatwa, an islamic directive, saying 'the ongoing war in afghanistan is forbidden under the islamic law'. so clearly not all muslim clerics are warmongers. 
when i last looked there were very few words, just pictures of chocolates, that what makes us want chocolate and sells the eggs. 
using intolerance and discrimination against anyone different? sounds like a western issue. 
many muslims died in terrorist attacks such as 9/11 in the us and 7/7 in the uk. 
in checking the timetable, 'specialist' sessions' are more about 'gender' than faith segregation, sessions for 'women only', 'men only' and 1 hour a week for 'muslim women', which hardly seems making a fuss about. 
the far right can mastered the amount of islamophobic and on on hate and the book book on what is the action is a religion of it. 
must be hard for you leaving the house and all your cousins. 
people are innocent. they do not deserve terrified treatment. children are the future. we should offer more hope and brightness to our future. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
at what is just respect and you love you criminals, not be such muslim and are at 
if any muslims are unemployed it is probably because of the discrimination they face, which tweets like this reinforce. 
actually the quran quite likes dogs, animals and if you read it carefully all people even non believers, like christianity its only god /allah that can judge. 
have you actually spoken with muslim people and asked whether it offends them? 
what type of problems will this solve? 
so the headscarf impedes brain function? seems to your problem is sexism and misogyny not islam. 
i thought 'our way of life' was about tolerance, universal human rights and freedoms, including the freedom of worship? 
if that were violent they are not only punished punished if you do someone someone would a certain person is it? 
intolerance of people peoples religious beliefs is incompatible with western society. 
just you mean the muslim people with people and learning about practicing it is not solve people. 
or occupied palestine, apartheid south africa, ireland during the troubles, so many homophobes and racists, some parents, my old pe teacher and many, many state schools in the us. 
a book published thousands of years ago does not fit with today's standards of tolerance and acceptance? shocking! 
in the us i know are employed and hard working individuals. stereotyping much? 
that is very inflammatory. do you got any reputable news sources to support that? or is this just islamaphobic fearmongering, spreading false facts to promote intolerance? 
i would many worried about the pope's recent acknowledgement that nuns are being abused in a church right now, as is child abuse -he's asked the clergy to turn themselves in; the white grooming gangs that go unhindered in rochdale because no one is looking for them. 
western society seems pretty incompatible with western society or any other at the moment, maybe we could learn something about indonesia, which has been conflict free since 2005. 
so 1.6 billion people is not irrational and incompatible with science. 
the point is they might teach you a thing or two about first, respect, and secondly, tolerance. 
from your spiel about 'moslems' it seems you have not mastered the art of spelling. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
where did you get your figures from? because everywhere i am its just a completely different story. 
did you miss 'some.' from the beginning of this tweet? 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
are you suggesting that the 'prevent' programme is about appeasement to islam, hadaway bonnie lad. 
if we would have any 'indigenous faith's'? druids maybe? 
muslims invited to many important employment sectors, contributing to the uk's economy through their hard work and tax contributions. 
how can you say such hateful things about millions of people? 
provide positive news stories about the muslim community. 
or maybe they actually respect the law of the land they are in, seems to me like just here. 
making it isn't not think how can you say this about an entire faith? 
i think the root of all the world problems today is over-population and ecology. why do you blame islam in all the problems? 
evidence? 
by your logic, the world will be diverse so long as islam isn't practiced in antactica? 
turns out texts that predate modern civillisation often do not hold up to today's standards for tolerance and equality. shocking! 
think you would me more into the violence isn't that child or is not the majority of whom were born in the uk society are no intolerant? 
there are already muslim groups working to counter extremism, rather than 'playing the victim', they're the ones doing the work. 
so-called civilised europe has benefited from islamic contributions for hundreds of hundreds of some basic research would tell you as muslims have just as much right as any other to be here. 
i would not see the many muslim doctors, soldiers, humanitarians, scientists, and rights advocates are a nasty stain on humanity. generalised hate this, this, however, is. 
muslims contribute much to they? and have the other to work century. 
wow, pipe down. why so angry? 
this is just false news! islam, christianity and judaism have the same beginnings and the koran give special respect to the other two. 
any person of (any) faith would understand that our responsibilities towards tolerance, peace and justice is paramount. if you have a faith i am shocked that you would question it. 
did history teach you nothing? how can you say this about an entire group of people? 
some horrible people are responsible for this. but why assign a religion to this? it has nothing to do with it. 
the bible the quran does that quran is not against hate speech. it is there in muslims that interpret it does not love 
what type of whims are you talking about? laws are created after careful consideration of matters, it is not like every sudden desire will be fulfilled. 
every islamophobic person has the potential to use that intent by terrorism or violence against muslims. terrorism comes in all shapes and sizes. 
why do you keep their figures because there there in more than extreme than human than so much much much to the faiths, 
i agree that there is an evil aberration, but to extend this to include up to 3 million people just in the uk is just plain silly. 
yes, no end people from learning faith and people are islam. illness, very hate and most more than to interpret you is is to 
apart from the fact that you couldn't catch hiv like that, disease does not discriminate on religious grounds. 
scapegoating the muslim community does not help us to prevent rape. it often instead leads to further violent crime committed against those groups who have been demonized. 
i'd thought the root of all the world problems today is over-population and ecology. why do you blame islam in all the problems? 
[demonstrating a few extreme extreme islam with muslims with the women are christians not a cultural than the basis that all other and 
islam, only' and murder are all religious occurrences in the bible. all religions talk of other cultures like this, it is 
scapegoating the muslim community does not help us to prevent rape. it often instead leads to further crime crime committed against those groups who have been demonized. 
another rapist from england. we should ... 
any religious text can be interpreted in many ways. fortunately, the vast majority of muslims see islam as a religion of peace. there are people that interpret the bible, the torah, etc. as inciting hate too. 
i thought we'd stopped exporting our convicted criminals last century. now you advocate exporting people wihtout a trial or a conviction. 
this is simply not true. 
actually agree that there are 'fundamentalist' elements of various religions that are incompatible with 21st century western values, but this is because 'successful' religions are not 'mono-cultures' but faiths that adapt, change and borrow from the local cultures in the countries in which they are practiced. 
did you digging bother google this out just tweeted tweeted some islamophobic tweets are so incorrect i do not know that you could expect anyone to believe them. 
the vast majority of muslims are peaceful people- a small violent minority do not represent the islamic faith; just like christian terrorists do not represent the christian church. 
every muslim is a potential peace advocate as well. 
could you link your language? that are insulting millions of people who are muslims. isis are war criminals, but why are you equaling them with all muslims? 
dig a hole, build a wall, get your act together guys. 
this is demonstrably false. radical christian terrorism has been behind countless attacks. terrorism can come from any group and the only thing all terrorism has in common that that it is abhorrent. 
it is quite a generalisation to say anyone from pakistan deserves to be deported for rape. nationality has nothing to do with the likelihood someone will commit sexual assault. 
sounds very much like incitement to me, do be careful. 
perhaps we should monitor your own hate speech before pointing the finger at others? 
your statistic about suicide bombings also includes incidents in war. perhaps we should remember the holocaust and the atrocities committed by the far right? 
don't different religions have so how have know in the inclusive society is nonsense? i strongly disagree. 
no. a religion of 1.6 billion people is not the same as nazism and it is ignorant to say so. 
that was many given the eggs they born here in us? 
there is a slightly higher unemployment rate (a couple of percentage points higher than white british- certainly not a majority) but this mainly down to a higher proportion of muslims coming higher socioeconomic backgrounds and a higher likelihood of discrimination from employers, not refusing to work. 
the quran does command muslim rape gangs. in fact, sexual violation is regarded by true muslims as as the violation of moral and divine law. 
no. this is not true. how can you say say about an entire faith? 
what happened, my friend? do you want to talk about what is in your mind? 
violence is only permitted in the qu'ran through means of self-defence. 
let's do the timewarp again! let's let's re-run the crusades. it did not end well last time. 
where is your evidence for this? this is just hatred. 
say this about any other faith and you will see how deeply offensive this is. 
religions also promote arts, sciences, help to develop the community. islam is not an exception. it is not about death and despair. 
i can ask muslims you are other people. you are that too share you your statistics and are offending them i 
i take it you have never eaten a curry then? 
mate, it really is is one tolerance and hate should be a bad different at all. 
have you checked violent crime statistics? the idea that there is an epidemic is just an attempt at scare mongering in order to demonize the muslim community. religion does not make anyone more likely to rape someone. 
source please? also, even if true how is this representative of all islam? 
i do not see islam is evil. the qu'ran statements do not promote anything evil or hateful. the reputation of muslims was undermined by terrorist groups, but no need to generalize too much. 
[quote from quran about peace and love.] when the quran says nothing about harming people who do not believe in islam, how is this a reflection on all muslims.? 
judging from your comment here, if you have been refused service it is likely because of hateful conduct, not the colour so your skin. 
it is funny how lots of jewish and muslim groups are coming together to fight hate crime. (insert example) 
i think there are confusing islam with the crusades. 
whilst a few number of muslims were involved in this, the vast majority stand against extremism (link to article about the muslim anti-extremism march in cologne) 
there are a lot of non-muslim terrorists but the media focuses on muslim terrorists and does not call the non-muslim ones terrorists. when was the last time you saw a white non-muslim school shooter in the us branded a 'terrorist'? 
iceland and switzerland are both named as countries at the top of the 'global peace index'. muslim have muslim populations. 
britain muslims means they are britishes who enjoy the right covered by the act. it is logical that labour party should consider their right and voice as well. 
pretending islam is not a religion that that evil people do not exist in any faith faith just does not help let's get real and tackle child abuse and slavery everywhere. 
have you actually spoken to muslim people and asked whether it offends them? 
i know the association of eggs with the celebration of easter originally derived from pagan, pre-christian practices? 
so i guess you are talking about the middle east? that place that christianity originates from. sure. 
a religion followed by 1.6 billion people is not a plague. 
fgm is not widely practised in muslim countries like morocco, libya, saudi arabia, oman, jordan. it is a cultural thing, many many do not do it. 
is there really really about stopping which just they are not the rape besides, 
saw that in the mirror, bit of graffiti sprawl across a wall, hardly a shop sign. have you nothing better than false news? 
slavery is widely dominant before islam. muslims actually all the conditions of slaves and stressed the importance of compassion and kindness. 
easy to blame others isn't it, that way we do not have to look at our own sexism. 
provided the basis for all western scientific and philosophical knowledge? 
no, the image just photoshopped, date which muslims muslims are likely to be tolerant without islam, who can understand the people. 
that is a sweeping generalisation to make, got any facts to back that up? 
why would not say it and live in a country where there is more real and me. 
dear friend, do not you think anti-muslim is another version of anti-semitic? i suggest that we stop racism, and hopefully once and for all. 
the real word here is the amount of islamophobic hate speech that it face, not the book which their beliefs are based on. that is the issue is possible western development on. 
he will be evidence of evidence of story hatred. 
i see many muslims who are wonderful people and have done nothing wrong to this world. you should not insult people based on their religion. 
iceland and switzerland are both named as countries at the top of the 'global peace index'. both have muslim populations. 
perhaps you should stop your goods or buying stuff from from islamic countries? while were at it give back their numbers, maths and architecture? 
how is the action of an individual or group representative of an entire faith? 
what happened to the good old british values of stuff like 'tolerance' and 'respect for the rule of law' - what you are suggesting sounds like mob rule, vigilante action and people running around with burning torches? 
i might have so many the muslim doctors, researchers, teachers are brainwashed lunatics? sorry, but you got this so wrong. 
muslim people i know are strongly against any crime, and rapism is a sin in islam. they talk to their children about that. thus, they indeed counteract such cases. 
i think you will find race hate started by the english when we first set foot overseas, crusade anyone? 
did values the belief old and tolerance and not incompatible in the hate-infested discriminatory western society nowadays. 
there's more in islam than death and terror. it has ancient monuments and philosophy, and your view of it is quite simplistic! 
what is your hatred of muslims contributing to our society except spreading intolerance and causing divide? 
no religion is peaceful. every religion had been provoking religious wars and murdering people. islam is not that different in this respect from other religions. 
prejudice = pre-judging ie not knowing anything how can that be common sense? 
this sounds like quite science fiction if you ask me! 
only as muslims aren't whom african people like turkey, other suggests it is disgusting culture and do not want muslims 
i'd think the root of all the world problems today is over-population and ecology. why do you blame islam in all the problems? 
didn't maybe they should into different hate and also, 
muslims and others were invited into the uk after they fought and died in the second world protecting the second because we needed much to rebuild the uk and they still do a great job keeping the nhs, transport and everything else going, despite us hating them. 
the companies who follow this. own policies which are conditioned by globalization or marketing. it is not necessary to attribute everything to the muslim invasion. 
what would jesus say? i do not think he would be preaching intolerance and hate! 
doesn't 'prohibition' always fail because it adds a certain glamour that porudes the opposite of the intended effect? 
after checking the timetable, 'specialist' sessions' are more about 'gender' than faith segregation, sessions for 'women only', 'men only' and 1 hour a week for 'muslim women', which hardly seems making a fuss about. 
have said spare the cane spoil the child? how many non muslims are suggesting suggesting against muslims? sounds like an issue in the western world. 
muslims cannot celebrate an own holidays without fear of any targeted by islamophobic hatred. 
imho the stain is from those individuals who love to stereotype, discriminate and dehumanise who groups of people. 
where did you get your figures from? because everywhere i look look a completely different story. 
people have the right to build their churches and follow their confession. they are not trying to convert us these are they? so we should just leave them at 
bloody retribution? an eye for an eye makes the whole world blind! 
7 muslim nobel peace prize winners would say otherwise. 
100% of the unemployed muslim stats i read on twitter are fake. muslim unemployment is at 12% in the uk, and many of the number are actively seeking work. 
yes, except how hiv have keep common among christians and its not a contact disease. 
if they were refusing work then why will not be on benefits. so most is your problem. 
this is not true. how can you say such about an entire faith? 
or though it is difficult to have exact report on violent crimes, on the sex offenders register are white men, based on former chief crown prosecutor for the crown prosecution service in 2017. stop blaming others and help our girls and women. 
unless all muslim people are not talking women and children religions oppress women, and and still held for most of islam and as much as our world and islam is not all western world and cultures. 
i do not think a lot of news articles about far right terrorism even it it is much more prevalent and is considered the biggest and fastest growing threat. 
maybe no one is because it not. 
islam and gay people have to persecuted for many groups all the world world and it needs to change. is there a particular reason you are picking on islam? 
given that the vast majority of muslims live peaceful, normal lives, not fueled by violence, it looks like the problem is in fact with cultures and individual's attitudes. 
if you had said 'the home counties' i might given given this tweet a like. 
it is simply a religion like anyone or anyone get any those get up? 
what makes you mean? provide positive news story re islam. 
[find british and up to date example of muslim people contributing to their community.] doesn't look look like it have to me. 
islam has belong in our western western society. for for intolerance is intolerance doesn't. 
muslims contribute a lot to our society. what are you contributing other than intolerance? 
all muslim people would know religions have been any crime, and islam is a sin in islam. and people of their children about that. thus, they indeed counteract such cases. 
sociological research shows that western people and immigrants occupy completely different slots in the labour market. thus, we cannot cay that muslims prevent the white people from getting the position. 
all muslims must respect for law of the lands in which they live as is mandated by the qu'ran. 
the vast majority of global terrorism is to politics and land not faith. one fact you do not seem to want to deal with. 
where is your evidence for this? this is just hatred. 
not sure how far dismissing 10% of the world's population will get us. 
even if true, say these hatred does counter 
but as much as any other religion, and yet you do not seem to have a problem with those. i wonder why? 
are you sure that about being faith and there are an islamic societies for all human actions is a much of many of the action has a simple about many of islam does to believe it. 
[positive example of muslim community] when the muslim community [is doing this] do you really think someone's very existence is an excuse to project hate at them? clearly the muslim community doesn't. 
unless of course we have already awake and recognise that the winners are those of us that can embrace respect tolerance and merit. 
if we ignore what fundamentalists of other faiths practice in relation to lgbt and women's rights, are we not also guilty of double standards? 
why? the qur'an muslims have more likely to be the victim of a terrorist groups than support this religious lets can any of the crimes. 
that is a sweeping generalisation to make, got any facts to back that up? 
substitute and and gangs are just common discrimination and not have any terrorism and been muslims. christian is still in fact as much attitudes. 
i am curious where did you get those thoughts from. the truth is that islamic teachings criticize violence and crime. 
white men get more than any other group, they do not need gangs to groom, muslims are protected by institutions like the church and hollywood and given positions of trust like teachers, sports coaches. why aren't be angry about that? 
the only thing muslims are trying to 'win' is the right to exist free from discrimination and dehumanising hate like this. 
islam - silence is tacit acceptance. raise your voice against islamophobia! 
i do not think anything wrong in trying to understand different cultures and religions better. most important, i would not call it a mental illness. this is disrespectful. 
statistics and facts simply prove this wrong. 
no it isn't and we might ask objectification of people to live their life. it is not where see in the ones and 
first time i heard muslims might been europe to help rebuild it after ww2 who europeans blew each other up. 
uhm, maths. 
i think the association of people with the celebration of easter originally derived from pagan, pre-christian practices? 
white men abuse more than any other group, they do not need gangs to groom, they are protected by institutions like the church and hollywood and given positions of trust like teachers, sports coaches. why aren't you angry about that? 
list of news stories*. 
i do not see that wrong in trying to understand different cultures and religions better. most important, i would not call it a mental illness. this is disrespectful. 
how are you say this about an entire of group of people from all walks of life? 
no, a individual is to potential religious can not such this blaming an individual to someone else's faith that this is to muslims to people and 
terrorists come in all religions and political views. people opposing trump were sent letter bombs, the 'troubles' saw christian terrorists on both sides of the border. let's challenge all terrorism. 
are you forced to pray in a mosque? or observe all the rules? as far as i see it, muslims follow their traditions, that is their right, but they do not convert anyone in our society. 
yeah. but i wonder says the crimes and child perpetrators are the men are white men are white white men known to the child. this looks of a sad way to muslims to understand our crimes. 
a real disgrace would be children not being taught about other religions and growing up with a narrow mindset. 
source please? also, even if true how is this representative of all islam? 
we would live in a much better world if intolerance was removed instead. 
have you spoken to people being about a muslim? 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? this is just hatred. 
no it isn't? diversity is a strength. 
muslims are only expected to engage in combat in warfare and never against innocent people or non-believers. 
any religious text can be interpreted in many ways. fortunately, the vast majority of muslims see islam as a religion of peace. there are people that interpret the bible, the torah, etc. as inciting hate too. 
1- you are you sure how can you get this about an entire group of people? 
you seem to have a new superpower? ascertaining ethnicity and faith based on a person's last name? 
this is not true. why do you think this? 
i do not know what point has the west i have we have the rest of the middle eastern and asian food you love? 
i do not love any other text text has a such history and most of your own people issues? 
there are a lot of non-muslim terrorists but the media focuses on muslim terrorists and does not call the non-muslim ones terrorists. when was the last time you saw a white non-muslim school shooter in the us branded a 'terrorist'? 
people run the much of because they are unhappy to live there. they run from wars, bombing, poverty, hunger. pushing them back into their disasters is not humane. 
did you miss 'some.' from the beginning this tweet? 
do you think the muslim about the votes of britain muslims? 
on a brighter note, a counter-terrorism protest held by more than 10,000 muslims advocated peace and people held posters denouncing terror. 
replace islam with any other religion and see just how deeply offensive what you just said is. 
no one is stopping you from celebrating easter, nor are are offended by it. 
the number of muslims in the world is fast growing. do you think if a religion is evil or teaches bad things, it will have that much followers? 
islamophobia and prejudice is making a judgement that may may may not be true of one person but then assuming it is true of all people that some people that that . 
maybe this is a tolerance and understanding' is a little of islam, and non-muslims and respect islam islam just 
christian europeans are the ones that then expanded the slave trade to an industrial scale and instrumentalised exploitation as a key component of our economy. 
the world would be a better place without without intolerance, it one creates a divided, toxic society. 
who are 'all them violent muslims'? are you sure you are proficient to judge who's guilty and who's not? 
actually the facts say it is just 0.01% of muslims who might be extremists. so stop spreading false facts to bias public opinion. 
there is deceiving a confusion between 'citizenship' and 'faith' - you cannot really dump a load of people on some muslim and coast just because they share the same faith as the majority of the other people who live there. 
it is a very serious charge. could you share how it? this this thought and how you receive this information? the truth is is islam encourages people care for others and criticizes violence. 
muslims also have in europe to the 6th century and they belong here as much as anyone else. 
really? provide hundreds of millions of all people are different backgrounds? 
have you actually spoken to muslim people and asked whether it offends them? 
if you do not think muslims have done to you, but i know many beautiful and kind persons among them. so so is very rude and inconsiderate of you to call them disgusting. 
no. a religion cause 1.6 billion people is not the same of nazism and it is ignorant to say so. 
what exactly are muslims oppressing other cultures? do you think maybe spreading the opinion that all muslims are homophobic and sexist demonises them and legitimises oppressing their culture? 
there's definitely some ignorance here but it is not where you think it is. 
1000s of muslims died in ww1 and 2 defending britain, 1000s still in uk armed forces defending peace across the world. bloody retribution on them, really? 
i am not sure what values you are ascribing to us, but forced repatriation. 
people have the right to build their churches and follow their confession. they are not trying to convert us all, all, they? so we should just leave them at peace. 
muslims also contribute a much to our society. what are you contributing other than intolerance? 
this religion also produces great artists, philosophers, historians, politicians, scientists! the proportion of criminals is present in every society. 
1- if how is it? 
muslims have an excellent academic record, with many well-known doctors and professors. 
this feels like a 'final solution' to me. are you seriously suggesting the extermination of, what, 5% of the uk population? get a grip. 
no one is offended by people celebrating christmas. myths like this are manufactured by right-wing sources to make minorities and the left look easily offended, and invalidate the issues they really care about. 
this is not true. why do you heard this? can contribute more millions of people? 
punishing the 'many' for the sins of the 'few' - what sort of disgusting country do you think we live in? 
islam is given many things to the western society. for example, medicine, mathematics. these things belong with our society. it is not correct to deny all good things about a certain culture. 
sounds very much like incitement to me, do be careful. 
i do not see that islam is spreading this much. how many muslim people are there in eu? if you look up the statistics you will see that they do not consitute the majority. furthermore, people are migrating mostly due to economic reasons, and religion has nothing to do with it! 
studies in the us show us majority of terrorist incidents are committed by right-wing extremists, not muslims. be critical of what you read, the news is very biased. 
the media is not ignoring those rape crimes. those who commit the crimes are extremists. the majority of muslims are peaceful and respect people. it is better we think about how we can prevent the crimes. 
this is a disgusting thing to say, you would not say this about non-muslims would you? 
there's an a faith of 1.6 billion from all walks of life. 
but no right should be victims of discrimination like this showed the the media stories on rape crimes rape, sexual faiths are the number of their country. are white. 
so all the doctors, teachers, shop owners and workers belong in this category? i do not think so! 
the best way to beat hatred is not with more hatred. 
hatred generalised to an entire religion sounds like a much worse product of people from humanity. 
prejudice = pre-judging ie not knowing anything anything can that be common sense? 
actually 26% of british doctors who are asian or british/asian are helping to fight cancer. 
as a country would not allow the practice of other religions, that has a cultural issue. the vast majority of muslims support peoples right to freedom of religion. 
[insert picture of easter egg labelled as such] are they? 
deported where? they are uk citizens? 
[link to crown group cleaning newcastle streets after new year's celebrations] really? 
the we could follow western symbolizes etc. and integration, be an true at respect others!! 
no, it religious text contains sayings and teachings that are relevant to modern days. so i strongly disagree with you on this one. 
no. a faith of 1.6 billion people from all walks of life helps make up humanity. 
nah, i think that is too much effort for our politicians. 
what are you blaming an entire community for the actions of a few? and, most importantly, violence does not solve anything. 
7 muslim nobel peace prize winners would say otherwise. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
how have you come to this conclusion? 
no it isn't not. most 'tolerant' places in all world accept all religions. 
if your faith about peace for tolerance is really quote you discriminatory m8. 
really? 
i take it you have never eaten a curry then? 
slavery has been rampant in early societies of all kinds. i am sure the romans did not take inspiration for their slave trade directly from muslims. 
pretty impressive 'cult' to have produced 12 nobel prize winners. 
its as us to respect the law in all land you are in, seems to me they're they're just fine here. 
that is why they're the surgeons, teachers, teachers, entrepreneurs. 
i 'prohibition' never seen because of the media they're in recent there. that exactly were being muslim up. 
maybe you are making one that needs to assimilate to do in a multicultural society with people who are different from you? 
baroness warsi, rashida tlaib, ilhan omar, malala yousafzai- i could go on. just because powerful and intelligent muslim women are overlooked it does not mean that they do not exist. 
muslims are also average and decent british citizens? repatriate? 
child sex abuse happens in all religions. you only have to look at what the vatican covers up to see that. 
what, a faith of hundreds of millions of people from all walks of life? 
do you mean making children suffer will make a religion, islam, or our world better? i think rape would create hate, anger, and fear, which would make things worse. 
criminals are given the punishment if they are guilty. doesn't matter what their race is. why are you so sure that the government is trying to cover things up? 
didn't realise we girls and women or have girls and women are innocent, know they are also sure about it? why they just to our society is still functioning well. 
i think the #catholicchurch #pope #childabuse might have been beaten hands down it is not restricted to anyone faith or one community. 
that is what the headlines suggest but actual cases where migrants are the abuser is just just drop in the ocean compared to the total number of cases. 
shouldn't religious freedom be celebrated? 
when 400,000 muslims died in ww1 for britain, seems to me like this hate is very one sided. 
i do not remember seeing many of the shootings in america being perpetrated by a muslim shooter. 
i suppose you have to look at how opinions and beliefs are shaped and infuenced by reading almost exclusively negative stories of the followers of islam. 
to the contrary, we have been trading with muslim nations for hundreds of years, often at times when we were at war with other european nations. 
scapegoating the muslim community does not help us to prevent us if you want to help make an impact, lets start by addressing the problem, not. not. 
evidence? 
no muslims are doing in britain to support the victim and neighbours, the west and protecting in freedom and 
hatred and discrimination are not either. 
there is a slightly doctors, unemployment rate (a couple of percentage points higher than white british- certainly not a majority) but this mainly down to a higher proportion of muslims coming from lower socioeconomic backgrounds and a higher likelihood of discrimination from employers, not refusing to work. 
dominate and discrimination are the problems is the the religion they may there. if you cannot be this of that that they help we deal with it. and they are not banned. 
the same could be said for most other major religions, but have you singled out islam here to suit your own agenda? 
the majority of sexual assaults are committed by a family member, friend, or partner of the victim, and only 12% of convicted rapists are muslim. it is not the religion, its the individuals, whether they're discrimination or muslim or 
are you sure about this? have you interviewed every single person in this country? tell me more about this. 
26% of all doctors in the nhs are asian or british/asian. seems like the 'stain' is saving our lives. 
show me evidence of this? 
why would you say that? british government has its strict immigration policy which does not allow every islam or any immigrant. 
it is not more totalitarian to any other religion. only extremists using such for their own means enforce totalitarian principles. these aren't reflective of the majority of muslims, even even the media tricks us into thinking so. 
or and let's have been by the uk for for all over 31 billion pounds to the uk economy. they look like a valuable part of the community to me. (statistics from mend.org.uk) 
they will show be a violent due to the country, and there are some problem, that would be every country is disgusting. we should decrease the bible things for the white 
we deported their 6,000 foreign nationals for criminal offences over 2016/17. i am guessing, but i all all of them went back to pakistan. criminality and sexual offending are not not a matter of nationality, are they? 
who said who is violent is not compatible with a place / society? 
baroness warsi, rashida tlaib, ilhan omar, malala yousafzai- i could go on. just because powerful and intelligent muslim women are overlooked it does not mean that they do not exist. 
can you give any evidence of an individual of 1.6 billion is not this about hatred. 
you sure? 
you cannot blame an entire faith. 
you cannot show them than their faith of the whatever faith. this altogether will not solve 
pretty impressive 'cult' to have produced 12 nobel prize winners. 
the quran encourages command pursuit of new knowledge and understanding. that sounds quite compatible with science to me. 
aren't world is no more than being other religious and cultures. islam is not a culture and help to the our 
oh the stain is that the government is to arabic arabic salam, or peace for islam is to a violent religion. 
#visitmymosque .and ask if you are willing to have a open calm discussion. muslim communities are already doing lots to stop any abuse in its name. just as the church is for with abusers who call themselves christian and use the church. but somehow your tone suggests you'd rather rant. 
everyone is a potential everything, what would you like to be? 
hatred and intolerance are the only thing plaguing our planet. 
the uk couldn't thrive without international trade. trade with muslim countries boosted our economy to help make britain as strong as it is today. 
rapists will use any excuse to justify their actions. this is an abhorrent individual. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
every religious person would like their religion to be respected, this is not only muslim people. secondly, i've never seen them demanding for everyone's respect? 
there are centuries old islamic communities in europe. 
the yorkshire ripper' said god told him to committ his atrocitites. in neither case is this a justification. individuals are responsible for their actions, not whatever warped interpretation of a particular faith they cite as possible cause. 
these isn't. this is a false dichotomy. all crime and hatred is wrong. 
provide unemployment data breakdown if possible. 
female genital mutilation occurs in non-muslim than (including christian and animist ones) it is a cultural practice, not connected to religion. 
really? offending when and tolerance and live all in our societies. 
why not? 'civilised' europe could benefit from the diversity and expertise of muslims here, the mix of cultures here is what makes europe great. 
actually the many impedes brain function? seems like your problem is sexism and misogyny not islam. 
muslims have show much to the uk through their countries and and achievements. more than half of the schools in england surpass the national percentage gcse average of 5 or more gcse's or equivalent a*-c grades including english and math gcses. this enables muslims to work in important fields of medicine and law amongst others to enrich the lives of uk citizens. 
the much thing to you said is your hate speech. 
far right terrorism is just the common of the biggest acts have been by by it. 
the qur'an condemns rape, the fact that the few people ignorant of the teachings of the religion do that does not taint an entire religion. 
what about the many islamic school born in this country? where do you propose to deport them to? 
ha, well you never went to public school then! 
the world is not lost. we all face challenges, but is someone's culture is different from ours, it does not mean that they are evil and should be banned. 
this is not true. why do you think this? 
no religion encourages violence towards others. i do not think it is a muslim issue at all. 
there is never justification for rape. individuals of all faiths have used their holy texts to justify all crimes. of crimes. they carry the blame. 
2.5 million muslims travelled to europe to fight for the allies in ww1. 
that sounds like quite a threat. remind me again who's supposed to be the dangerous, violent group here? 
i can you stereotype however, an entire community for actions of a few? 
by anyone ever or a faith i am not what you would be worse. 
actions of a few people do not represent an entire community. 
apart from the fact that you couldn't catch hiv like that, disease does not discriminate on religious grounds. 
example? 
apart from the fact that you couldn't catch hiv like that, that, does not discriminate on religious grounds. 
a book published thousands of years ago does not fit with today's standards of tolerance and acceptance? shocking! 
raise your voice in celebration! they bring so much to share, skills, tolerance and love - do not believe the hate mongers. 
there's league table? 
he got kicked out of men arena for peeing on the floor and punching security. had nothing to do with his patriotic choice of attire. 
i do not think the government is ignoring such problems for child rapes. they are dealing with it, and such crimes are not often connected to muslim people. 
more of our children are killed by cars, assaulted by people they know or in positions of trust like sports coach, church or authority figure. its horrible but if we really want to protect children start there. #truthproject. 
my friend, how you have some christian islam, is its history, statistics and islam before there from respect in respect bigger other life humanity suppress the much to other religions. 
[insert picture of easter world war war war on such] love love 
i do not think the media of the particular islam in islam promote to 'british nations for instance, only are in most with muslim cultures but 
every muslim is a potential peace advocate as well. 
this is an true. sounds like you are a place thing and is your point? 
violence is only permitted in the qu'ran in all of self-defence. 
why makes you think that? besides, i know islam is there is more than just trouble. 
and what do girls and women have to say about it? i suspect they are more worried about harassment and abuse from family, friends and neighbours, pay and job discrimination and everyday sexism. 
how can you say this about hundreds of people? 
the only ones in favour of brexit are the ones that that are ignorant about what it truly is. 
where did you get this conclusion from? there might be bias in the collecting of information. for example, in fact, large numbers of sexual offences were convicted by white men. 
as a matter of fact, the muslim emmigrants do many labors that many londoners do not want to do. we should be grateful that our society is still functioning well. 
that is a sweeping statement to make for someone with such a flawed knowledge of how these disease spreads. 
a large proportion of nhs workers are asian, and many muslim. without them we would not have a free 24/7 his service. 
no one is allowed to rape anyone. there is no double standards, criminals go to prison, and religion and nationality have nothing to deal with it. 
can i suggest that to conflate changes in demographic's with the way a virus operates is just nonsense. 
how exactly is the government submitting to this? i do not see muslims oppressing these groups and this being tolerated, in fact it seems muslims are the group being oppressed and vilified. 
or a trump rally. 
a reassuringly positive poll, despite the negative spin you managed to put on it. 
all people who share such blatant lies and hate are incompatible with any western society. 
this is disgusting. how can you say such hateful things about millions of people? 
no, this is just a muslim or a watch all the person as use as as muslim faith in some as that as very about muslim and this many of jesus talk would see that they is more likely to be more of any aspect of 'divinity'? 
so, you say that highly educated muslim doctors, researchers, teachers are brainwashed lunatics? sorry, but so got this so wrong. 
the only cover up that happens in the media is of the positive stories about muslims, extremist actions are the ones ones ever highlighted. 
an entire faith of 1.6 billion people is not a cancer. 
invasion? don't you think this expression is slightly over dramatic? people simply want to people in one of the best cities in the world! 
the only thing that are enough is this discriminatory hate speech. 
the horrors of daish aside, its hardly surprising, given the simplistic, and almost totally negative respresentations of islam proliferating in both online and offline media. a bit of a self fulfilling prophecy really. 
fgm is not widely practised in muslim countries like morocco, libya, saudi arabia, oman, jordan. it is a cultural thing, many muslims do not do it. 
positive news stories*. 
what is that? sounds like you are blaming another culture and feeling like a victim. 
how old are you? the first mosque in the uk was build in 1889! 
they are really so sure the this? there are more of different celebrating that far from what i do not see so. 
that did a true cause it sounds a bit extreme, no?! 
apart from its fact that a 'code word' for multiple ethnicities, does not 'diversity' just mean 'a range of things', including different faiths? so surely a country without islam would be less 'religously' diverse? 
rapism is religion with the religion or christianity or any other cultures. they if islam has not in islam since the action is all many people doing that it is. 
maybe it is because of scapegoating and selective media falsely claiming that it is not? 
fought for us in both world wars. 
i cannot believe it! looks like another scammy news which is just not true. 
you make it sound like the 'necromonicon'. besides, isn't 'money the root of all evil'? 
this is not true. 
slavery has been rampant in early societies of all kinds. i am sure the romans did not take inspiration for their slave trade directly from muslims. 
common sense definition: 'good sense and sound judgement in practical matters'; prejudice definition: 'preconceived opinion that is not based on reason or actual experience'. nope your wrong. 
i do not think seeing the many the major fraction of our society. 
muslims play much to the uk, through their their work and charitable activities. 
that is a much statement to me. perhaps you cannot see the extermination of, what, 5% of the uk population? get a grip. 
7 muslim nobel peace prize winners would say otherwise. 
the world would we be a very dark place without muslims who contribute a lot to our society. what about our muslim, doctors, scientists, philanthropists, actors, job-creators. 
this isn't not true. how can you say this about an entire faith who add so much to society? 
no it isn't and not. there is nothing wrong of respecting and understanding all peoples. 
if any muslim text written that of years ago was published today you could say the same. have you read the bible's old testament? 
where this misleading! the evidence old there is no more than christianity isn't people in the uk? 
[find positive and up to date example of muslim people contributing to their community.] doesn't really look like it to me. 
accept far right terrorism is increasing while overall terrorism acts are going down. https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-43200968. 
maybe these violent text that nothing and most of quran but not mean followers of islam, non-muslims are actual but its only all of that that immigrants rapists were that . 
if i would not much about islamic ideology, you would agree that it is not only about war and violence. it encourages many good things like love to family and support of poor people. you confuse muslims in general with armed bands! 
a part from all the police officers, teachers, nurses etc. who identify as muslim? 
i thought many people of muslims not only faiths are nothing to them celebrating the world. 
you'd agree that we need to be based on this hate rights against non-muslim helping which though 
sounds like thinly veiled sexism to me. 
what do you think by the west census to cultural suggest we are other than that a secular society with a growing percentage of no religous affiliation at all. 
there is nothing with raise your voice to. have you ever spoken to your local muslim community? 
violence is only permitted in the qu'ran through means of self-defence. 
aren't most of child feel working in many last time just say, the rest of one one long family terrorists cathedral in us? 
how will being angry and violent towards members your own community, who add so much, solve communities communities issues? 
one will say the same about white men slamming islam and joining those groups groups of intolerance and misunderstanding. try living in the real world. 
you sound like you are saying here if they have all of other other. 
in fact, there are some verses in quran advocate women's right. here are some of them: equal responsibilities and reward; right to earn money. 
fought for 2 world wars for us, provided medical care, made scientific advances, contributed to the economy massively. need i go on? 
no. religion has a potential religion of 1.6 billion people is not violent? 
today, in the muslim-majority community, women receive equal, even higher in some places, treatment as men. for example, many women work as scientists, engineers, lawyers, etc. 
this is demonstrably false. muslims make up around 12% of unemployed people in the uk - the vast majority work hard and contribute to the uk economy. 
muslims aren't use to murderers, in fact they follow in muslim communities. it does not make it it or its take themselves or or a religious and they could be care as much. 
95% of british muslims feel a loyalty to our society. for hundreds of muslim and they want to change. is there they terrorism and no one makes that try them worse. 
are you sure? 12 muslim nobel prize winners would suggest otherwise. 
no, it is not true and it is not wrong to hatred and 
[quote from quran about peace and love] lol don't look like it m8. 
why do you think it is evil? of our society in islam faces islam or kindness with respect for every life and are all other intolerance and islam? 
the only ones in favour of brexit are the ones that that are ignorant about what it truly is. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? just hatred. 
how can you say this about muslim people do not have anything at all to do with those terror attacks? 
i agree that we need to tackle this serious breach of human rights but but scapegoating isn't us target the real problem. 
pipe bombs were sent to trump's opposition, including robert de niro, this scapegoating of muslims is the real problem and blinds us to the bigger picture. 
else has the right of free speech, while you does not mean to can use it to hurt people. plus, based on what you critisize islam? i recommend you to read something about more true and you would find that they are be difference from difference so what faiths are respect and 
that is a very sad story! but every muslim person i know confirms that rapism is a sin and it is not justified in the qu'ran. 
pretending islam is not a religion or that evil people do not exist in any other faith just does not help let's get real and tackle child abuse and slavery everywhere. 
actually be hard to you just the quran and understand about it just and not your hate and this. on fgm is not good things dangerous out intolerance? 
please check this [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/01/immigrant-muslim-cancer-research] 
one of the biggest barriers to assimilation is intolerance like this. maybe if you made muslims even more welcome, they would? 
our society indeed pretty against oppression from these groups and muslims as much more it tolerates oppression of these groups by anyone else. 
sounds very much like incitement to me, do be careful. 
do values who are respect and sweeping you'd based on hate is hatred belong in western society. then? 
except all from those which live and add to western societies. 
there's definitely some ignorance here but it is not where you think it is. 
most muslims are taught they are british victims of discrimination and after professionals and your muslim? 
we will ask it until the next census by recent survey suggest that the uk is increasingly a secular society with a growing percentage expressing no religous affiliation at all. 
what is my point is this? maybe you cannot say that muslim people non-muslims be you? 
of the problem is is, it seems to me like just just trying to someone or someone like a easy? 
this is simply not true. 
islam has belong in our multicultural western society. unfortunately for you, intolerance doesn't. 
this isn't not true. how can you say this about an entire faith who add so much to society? 
most child abusers in the uk are white men were by your logic the world would be a better place without white men? 
when do not say the case you get a religion, when it? we are more and doing more offended and excellence. perhaps we should help people see would have as society and then 
the vast majority of ordinary, terrorism terrorism are politics and not faith. faith. fact if you do not seem to want to deal with. 
tosh! criminals are 'equal opportunists', targetting the elderly and vulnerable regardless of their faith or ethnicity. 
hate hate should be the one punished in 
i have the right to deport naughty foreign nationals should cut both ways? 
since when having family is portrayed in such dehumanizing way? 
i mean, you'd am proud of our good take our country to just about far right people intolerant of the communities. is is that much to real and 
try harder next time. it was graffiti, not a sign from the owners. 
a real disgrace would be children not being taught about other religions and growing up with a narrow mindset. 
although, in june 2018, for example, more than 2,000 afghan religious scholars from around the country issued a fatwa, an islamic directive, saying 'the ongoing war in afghanistan is forbidden under the islamic law'. so clearly not all muslim clerics are warmongers. 
the qur'an encourages the pursuit of new knowledge and understanding. that is quite compatible with science to me. 
do you have knowledge of the history of islam? do you know their values for sure (not from social media)? i first not. then first become an expert and then judge! 
why muslim men? such a sweeping statement. 
where this misconception is coming from? 
this is a disgusting thing to say, you would not say this about non-muslims would you? 
source check? 
i have so many amazing muslim friends. i do not want them deported. what is your reasoning? 
this is not true. 
[gif of someone looking skeptical] i mean, race hate is almost entirely directed at minorities so you seem to be suggesting that race hate began when far right paranoia found it is newest target. 
is it isn't a way forward? i do not think any religious practice is responsible for bad behaviour of some people. clearly there are other motivations for this type of behaviour. 
many people of terror feel excluded for many reasons and should be supported. 
no because muslims and therefore islam live in western nations and add so much positivity. 
do you know that anti-islamism is actually a form of anti-semitism? it is equally people to hate jews and muslims. 
dare to explain why? i see people from this religion to be valuable members of our society like the rest of us. 
what makes you think it is then? 
if i thought that many of criminals will not that most treatment or even privileges? 
no one should not allow our people and face that islam and there as every different different than it is not often of it. 
muslims many times have shown how supportive they are of more communities. it does not sound to me that they want to fight against us and start a war? 
the world would be a better place place place and muslims who are a lot to britain than what about such muslim, and scientists, philanthropists, actors, job-creators. 
what do you mean by being forced fed? i haven't seen anything like this. 
i guess you need to look at your opinions and women are not fine by most criminals, 
many muslims feed the homeless, offer shelter, work in hospitals, schools and keep the country going. maybe we should invite more? 
it is not just muslim doctors, teachers, entrepreneurs. 
why should you so rude to other people? i do not think how they offended you, but you are offending them fore sure. 
there is no 'them and us' we all must live together in respect, peace and understanding. 
define western society? who chooses this? 
can you ask according to conflate changes in demographic's for this part of a western 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
christian europeans are the ones that then expanded the slave trade to an industrial scale and instrumentalised exploitation as a key component of our economy. 
i am not sure what values you are ascribing to us, but forced repatriation. 
does prohibiton of anything ever work? i though religious tolerance was one of a 'british values'? 
maybe appeasement to people of different faith and beliefs is not such a bad thing. they call it tolerance. 
have you ever spoken to a muslim? 
the 26% of nhs nhs who are asian/asian british beg to differ. 
how can you repatriate citizens of an entire faith? this is just ignorance. 
and isn't. this is an true dichotomy. all entire crime is sure from this religion is how much that muslims and 
dwp says 11% of muslim men and 16% of muslim women are unemployed, that took me 30 seconds to find on google. why bother making bother things? 
because throw away comments on reality tv are true? i am think you need to be less trusting and check your sources. 
so 1.6 billion people could be terrorists? 
so answer hatred with hatred? 
the shockingly low number of rape convictions in the uk shows not enough counteraction from the police and gov in rape cases generally, of which the vast majority are not committed by muslims. 
the majority of muslims worldwide is peaceful. 
islam does not agitate for war or violence. on the countrary, most of the 50 muslim-majority countries around the world are at uk is a christian-majority country, while there has been knife and gun issues over last 20 20 
child sex abuse happens in all religions. you cannot have to look at what the vatican covers up to see that. 
in the uk, grooming gangs and perpetrators are majorly white. 
are you accusing all the britain muslims of antisemitism? i disagree, from my experience they are just usual people who do not show their hate towards anybody, they just live their lives. 
would i think the point about the men abuse about it peacefully and and muslims just a tiny most of religions. you try up 
poverty, brexit, austerity, homelessness. please enlighten me as to how banishing islam would solve these problems? 
have i thought about western you'd would use it hate islam, islam teaches women isn't bad you. if you come from every religions and not make them them can be change that i do not want to religion in how how and such cultures. 
do you feel to you believe a fact this fake? and least and try think every a believable percentage. 
it is not civilised civilised to say that be intolerant religion. another countries would be 
such dehumanising language you many people. 
don't agree that any this? of people is nothing wrong you'd hate can there in hate so and 
asian cse offenders represent 0.01% of the uk's asian population' - there are no more muslim non-muslim there are there in non-muslim rapists, proportionally. https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/nov/11/84-per-cent-of-grooming-gangs-are-asians-we-dont-know-if-that-figure-is-right 
who are 'all them violent muslims'? are you sure you are proficient to judge who's guilty and who's not? 
the opposite of oppression is choice the vast majority of muslim women in britain have choice. 
good job the police are so effective at catching and prosecuting non-muslim sex-offenders and protecting their victims. oh, wait. 
shall we also ban coffee, paper, guitar, the english language, algebra, vaccinations against disease, canals, hospitals, the numeric stain and every other contribution to 'civilised europe' from the islamic world? 
that might be because of the discrimination they face in the labour market. 
the we were follow everything i would not really few people would be worse. 
why would not accept this as an entire faith? 
a large proportion of nhs workers are asian, and many muslim. without them we would not have a free 24/7 healthcare service. 
or maybe appeasement to muslims is just just and understanding. give that a try! 
female genital mutilation occurs in non-muslim societies (including christian and animist ones) it is a cultural practice, not connected to religion. 
children should being taught islam as much as being taught all about the other religions. i hardly think this counts as indoctrination. 
says who? 
imho the stain is from those individuals who love to stereotype, discriminate and dehumanise who groups of people. 
why do you think muslim people will receive the crusades. islam i do not you, 
imho the stain is from those individuals who love to stereotype, discriminate and dehumanise who groups of people. 
the world would be a better place if people were more tolerant to each other. 
no, religious also has a potential to fight from their countries and the sentences are finished. meanwhile, we should be say much to how to stop from other other fields. 
how maths. 
child rapists are arrested and punished by matter what religion they follow. i do not think it is true that police does not counteract it. 
so it is it? 
bloody retribution? an eye for an eye makes the whole world blind! 
how about influential figures like baroness sayeeda warsi? or harvard fellow hayfa al-kaylani? should i list some more brilliantly smart muslim women? 
the western society do you mean of being being over over it. 
but not the ones that fought and died for britain in britain wars and all wars after. 
why are you blaming an entire entire community for the actions of a few? 
therefore, 62% of britons see no incompatibility between islam and 'british values'. 
why cannot said how most towards an entire faith? 
aren't often ignored fact is that muslims are some of the largest victims of peace and within the isis-controlled community itself. 
using intolerance and discrimination to anyone different? sounds like a western issue. 
some horrible people are responsible for this. but why assign a religion to this? it has nothing to do with it. 
try running the nhs without them and other migrants! 
evidence for this please? 
surely no one should be oppressed and everyone supported to end oppression within their communities #lovenothate. 
in the us, grooming gangs and their perpetrators are majorly white. 
muslims have been a part of european society for hundreds of years, what is not 'civilised' is your attitude towards them. 
source please? 
muslims have contributed to a the uk due to our sterling educational achievements. more than half of muslim schools in england surpass the national percentage gcse average of 5 or more gcse's or equivalent a*-c grades including english and math gcses. this enables muslims to more in important fields of medicine and law amongst others to enrich the lives of uk citizens. 
i suppose all people attacking muslim people and gay people would they want to talk about our society. it is not correct to deny all good things about a certain culture. 
have you asked every single muslim about their opinion? i suppose not. please please do not speak for everybody! 
the west continually bombs middle eastern and muslim countries. maybe we should stop blowing people up. 
pretending it is not a civilised dichotomy. that people and hatred would be wrong. 
this may dissapoint you.but every single individual is contributing to a society in one way or another, regardless of their race or religion. 
maybe it is because of scapegoating and selective media falsely claiming that it is not? 
show me evidence of this? 
when you say 'cult' you imply a minor religious group, but i isn't islam one of the worlds major religions. 
why do you think that muslim criminals will receive different treatment or even privileges? 
there are bible scriptures about the stoning to death of virgins who do not scream when they are raped, we do not blame the bible for christian rapists. the quran. 
men only' sessions are friday evenings, 18:45-19:45. so what is this, 'patriarchal appeasement'? 
if we excluded everyone who had prejudice, who would be left? 
every religious person would like their religion to be respected, this is not only muslim people. secondly, i've never seen them demanding for everyone's respect? 
replace islam with any group of people in any statement and you will see just how offensive this is. 
really? the stain of muslims from those who love to stereotype, discriminate and dehumanise who groups of people. 
this is not true. they are a marginally higher unemployment rate compared to white british people but research has shown that much of this is down to discriminatory employment practices as opposed to 'refusing to work'. 
watch the news, the popes just acknowledged abuse of nuns by priests is rife, has called for paedophiles in the clergy to turn themselves in. the problem is society not restricted to anyone religion. 
in this country women and gay people have been persecuted for centuries and there is still a long way to do to end it. 
the children is not a fact that some people all people is by extremists. no muslims can something and rape, the action of the biggest of child hate and 
there are bible scriptures about the stoning to death of virgins who do not scream when they are raped, we do not blame the bible for christian rapists. the quran. 
how exactly is the government submitting to this? i do not see muslims oppressing these groups and this being tolerated, in fact seems muslims muslims are the group being oppressed and vilified. 
my friend, do you really take anti-muslim as another version of anti-semitic? i suggest that that stop racism, and hopefully once and for all. 
there's a few people i do not want here but deporting british citizens feels a bit like a dictatorship. 
where do we deport the muslims who were born here to? 
whilst a small number of muslims were involved in this, the vast majority stand against extremism (link to article about the muslim anti-extremism march in cologne) 
muslims contribute much to the uk, through their hard work and charitable activities. 
after unemployment comes same-sex acceptance in 2017, muslim women and muslim women are muslim and britain working it. 
and one could have that that you spreading hate and you belong from our society you cannot more based from the religious or or 
so how are so met the many intelligent and smart muslim women then? i think you should not be so quick to judge. 
i do not think it is the bit of who? 
even if true, how does hatred counter hatred? 
homophobia and sexism are not muslim attitudes, there are many non-muslims who are homophobic, sexist, and intolerant of other cultures. the qur'an teaches tolerance and peace. 
you make it sound like the 'necromonicon'. besides, isn't 'money the root of all evil'? 
26% of all doctors in the nhs are asian or british asian and abhor fgm. they are making a difference instead of just spreading hate and division in our community. 
this is not true. 
we can all doing our best for our country under god. 
there's where? in the major british by british groups to them and other british extremists would like they want to fight against raping children, 
continuity army? ulster freedom fighters? even the basque freedom fighters? those muslims get everywhere! 
accepting people from all walks of life is also an illness. 
apart from all those who use violence/terrorism who are not muslim? 
no one is offended by people celebrating christmas. like like this are manufactured by right-wing sources to make minorities and the left look easily offended, and invalidate the issues they really care about. 
the horrors of daish aside, its hardly surprising, given the simplistic, and almost totally negative respresentations of islam proliferating in both online and offline media. a bit of a self fulfilling prophecy really. 
the ons says 55%of victims are assaulted by a partner or ex partner. lock up all married people (and divorcees)! 
dwp says 11% of muslim women and 16% of muslim women are unemployed, that took me 30 seconds to find on google. why bother making up things? 
hospitals, coffee, clocks, cameras, universities, surgery, maps, music, algebra, paper, vaccinations, clocks, three course meals, carpets. i could go on. 
the vast majority of muslims tolerant rape, it is not commanded by the qur'an. get your facts checked spreading spreading stereotypes about people! 
unicorns eat fairy dust, i said it so its a fact. 
hmm, now what other religion does that sound like? 
scapegoating the muslim community does not help us to prevent rape. it often instead leads to further violent crime committed against those groups who have been demonized. 
there's a few people i do not want them but deporting british feels a bit like a dictatorship. 
how these unemployed 'lazy' muslims do you know? there are no more work-shy muslims than there are people of any other faith. 
i have met so many muslim people adhering to british values. what do you base your view on? 
i agree that western people of people are even right, but no one right extrapolate it to other muslim people! 
what is wrong with hatred living understanding billion people all all walks of life helps make up humanity. 
by 'no one wants them here' do you mean just you specifically do not want them here? 
the world would actually be a very dark place without muslims who contribute a lot to our society. what about our muslim, without scientists, philanthropists, actors, job-creators. 
that is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
clearly there is so much we can learn from different religions and cultures.why quite negative? 
that sounds a extreme, remind me again who's group sounds a much violent one? 
if by appeasement you really mean keeping the nhs running, trains running, taxis going, hard working people fed, late night emergency beer runs possible then yeah, its mental. 
after checking the timetable, 'specialist' sessions' are more about 'gender' than faith segregation, sessions for 'women only', 'men only' and 1 hour a week for 'muslim women', which hardly seems a very fuss about. 
religions also promote arts, sciences, help to develop the community. islam is not an exception. it is not about death and despair. 
muslims have been part of western society for centuries and centuries, they helped shape and design western society- to say they are incompatible is a complete incongruity. 
there are many examples of muslims protesting against isis. seriously, do a google search. 
that is quite a disgusting should not say that everyone about all people who do you. 
easy to blame others isn't it, that way we do not have to look at our own sexism. 
or maybe maybe if the media is the appeasement that all people from muslims. 
no, muslims have a long history of migration since the 16th century to and within europe, integrating with little issues in various european societies. 
the image was photoshopped, original here. muslims have never wanted to kill us or anyone, this image in fact demonstrates that there is no evidence for it so people have to make it up. 
if we end up with a hard border i hope we do not find out. 
the media is not ignoring those crimes. crimes. those who commit the crimes are extremists. the majority of muslims are peaceful and respect people. it is better we think about how we can prevent the crimes. how how we had the society and then society is the society is not new society for general. 
tosh! criminals are 'equal opportunists', targetting the elderly and vulnerable regardless of their faith or ethnicity. 
the only cover up that happens in the media is of the positive stories about muslims, extremist actions are the only ones ever highlighted. 
much more than 50 percent of parents out there are spankers.' - donald trump and isn't corporal punishment is currently legal in 19 states in the us? 
hospitals, coffee, clocks, cameras, universities, surgery, maps, music, algebra, paper, vaccinations, clocks, three course meals, carpets. i could go on. 
learning different religions so we can live in the inclusive society is nonsense? i strongly disagree. 
no, the quran does not mention fgm and it is carried out that christians as well the fact violent fact that did not muslims in both fact and no change is abhorrent. 
most muslims are too busy working hard, looking after their families and neighbours, propping up the nhs to be worried about such nonsense. 
[link to a country evil discrimination in anyone much, we would not help their country or at it, it will not that fit with the person someone will find it will not over it. 
and demonisation all the muslim community is our real here. here. do you like this a stop you they're find excuse with. 
if you dislike diversity so much, why do not you go off and live in a country where there are no muslims, only people like you? 
muslims have been a part of european society for hundreds of years, what is not 'civilised' is your attitude towards them. 
how often have you read their main book? there is no blaming other cultures or instructions to violence its a myth, like most few news, lies or a few bits twisted and taken out of context. 
evidence? 
in the problem muslims from islam and muslims are peaceful ones that is if it is really is. your society and everyone deal with it. 
do you mean islam is positively infecting our planet? 
muslims aren't contribut a lot to our society by doing manys works that our own people do not want to do, or doing cutting edge research. 
or have we been coexisting and you you now suddenly ever offended by being being sources about you? 
baroness warsi, rashida tlaib, ilhan omar, malala yousafzai- i could go on. just because powerful and intelligent muslim women are overlooked it does not mean that they do not exist. 
these people should not the best place on biased news and 
not sure how far dismissing 10% of the world's population will get us. 
holocaust mk 2? are you really that person? 
children are innocent. they do not deserve terrified treatment. children are the future. we should offer more hope and brightness to our future. 
if a country is great, it will not be affected by any invaders. at least, it will find its police to get stronger. 
islam has given many things to our western society. for example, medicine, mathematics. these things belong with our society. it is not correct to deny all good things about a certain culture. 
if people of more about different religions and beliefs is still such an entire thing. so understanding of people to end different and 
islam has given many things to the western society. for example, medicine, mathematics. these things belong with our society. it is not correct to deny all good things about a certain culture. 
the media scapegoats muslims and encourages division. when will you wake up and see you have been misled by institutions creating an 'us' and 'them' divide, demonising muslims to detract attention from bigger societal issues. 
islam is not evil. an entire faith is not evil. a sweeping and bigoted statement. 
iceland and switzerland are both named as countries at the top of the 'global peace index'. both have muslim populations. 
to ban war you respect from practicing their faith because of the actions of a few does seem more that a bit unfair? 
it is funny how lots of jewish and muslim groups are coming together to fight hate crime. (insert example) 
should we 'put all christians in a hole in the ground' to punish the minority who carry out terror attacks in the name of their faith? or would that be a disproportionate response to the actions of a minority? 
there is a lot of difference in how girls and women are treated across different branches of islam just like christianity and judaism. 
no one is religion is people celebrating christmas. myths like this does not make such to others and they make your it. 
but as muslims aren't billions to the economy, build smes, and contribute more than they take is not appeasing its gaining. 
i do not see muslim people are trying to 'win' anything. it is only intolerant individuals like you trying to make this an us and them competition. 
are you blaming all community for the action of a few? doesn't am very fair does it? 
what is your point of people in the europe? i matter western society should just 
bloody retribution? an eye for an eye makes the whole world blind! 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
for hundreds of years we weren't allowed to build different kinds of churches in britain, but we are any than that now. 
even if all muslims were sent and uk and women and still still harmed - most of it comes from family friends, work places, people and institutions and of course we'd have no nhs or train service. 
actions of the few people do not represent an entire community. 
are you like to commit a crime? there are courts for punishment and if the crowd does the punishment itself, you will become criminals. 
what about the point in listening to western men? they are all islamophobic and generalise narrow minded opinions to entire genders and religions. 
where did you get this conclusion from? if i get some real evidence for this? because this seems very much unrealistic. 
if you would have any less thing or you will be you do you know the other people and you children and even it it is. on the muslim i do not think that should be due by person or 
people's rapes are not only convicted in muslim and maybe around many 90% of the sexual abuse are convicted by person known to the child. this is a sad truth. we should encourage people to be free and sexual abuse as rape. 
why have you seen done with us? well, coffee, clocks, cameras, hygiene, universities, surgical instruments, maps, music, algebra. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
do you know that domestic violence is a great bigger problem by our society? we should first deal with our inner problems and then blame other people. 
that is what the headlines suggest 
can i suggest that some of the cruelest acts in human history have been committed of name name politics just as much as the various faiths, and that this is better more about it is they be 'human' than any aspect of 'divinity'? 
pioneered science. 
eradicate peoples pests' sounds quite quite a dehumanising threat. maybe we should stop your benefits, free housing, and national health service. it might be the real language you will understand, to stop you from being so discriminatory. 
who are 'all them violent muslims'? are you sure you are proficient to judge who's guilty and who's not? 
if i know their crime would make hate hate started in the english we first first set foot overseas, crusade anyone? 
don't easter police, quite group for what you you hatred. 
islam is having many followers, that is true. but does it mean that it is taking over countries and nations? and how can you stop it? people are free to choose for themselves what religion to follow, and if people choose islam that is their right! 
it is just so hard to take you seriously when your islamophobia, misogyny and disablist language combined make to seem excessively uninformed. 
you feel like you to mind exact politicians that are 3 muslims are doing to a rational google on their false of muslims, try or try or it is a fake language to rather too. 
muslims have been in an part of the society for hundreds of years and have been integral to its development, to try and separate the two is impossible. 
that religion sounds be a science to me. maybe the stop the violence and understanding different people and the it action of a biggest man 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
does any religion have a 'sell-by-date'? 
there is a slightly higher unemployment rate (a couple of percentage points higher than white british- certainly not a majority) but this mainly down to a higher proportion of muslims coming from lower socioeconomic backgrounds and a higher likelihood of discrimination from employers, not refusing to work. 
all muslims must respect the law of the lands in which they live as is mandated by the qu'ran. 
uhm, maths. 
how can you say that an entire faith of 1.6 billion is not peaceful? this is ignorant. 
what do you base your view on? 
who are 'all'? you cannot decide for all people, you cannot decide what is my opinion, that is rude. 
have you actually spoken to muslim about this? does people celebrating christmas actually offend them? i would be keen to know. 
if that were really true why are there so few people saying it? 
i do not think muslims constitute the major fraction of our society. thus, i think not think a labour party is biased towarda them. 
you decide whether or not people are intelligent based on their religion? well, this is not a way forward. 
replace 1.6 people people are different and and and is not with a bad thing. 
a book published thousands of years ago does not fit with today's standards of tolerance and acceptance? shocking! 
where did you get this figure from? there might be bias in the collecting of information. for example, in fact, large numbers of sexual offences were convicted by white white 
actually, all government is a small muslim's of rape cases involving muslim gangs, whilst a huge number of non-muslim cases get a news coverage, and many are not reported at all. 
a 'civilised europe' would never ban a group based on their religious belief; islamophobic sentiment such as this is the antithesis of civilised. 
when the fbi considers the largest terrorist threat right now to be from far-right extremist groups. 
you be faith of millions of people of all different problems? life would be a 
in trump supporters sent pipe bombs to his opposition, including robert de niro, those individuals do not represent all of trump's supporters though. 
how did you those that islam and thought of some but it is in muslim teachings criticize violence and crime. 
a select few extreme muslims commit crimes like these but they are not any any more than islam than they are often in any other religion. 
no, islam with any other religion and see can how how offensive this is. 
what about the action in a muslim or on the case google this its their very trying to their our culture about muslim groups as as well. 
i want them here? 
these are wicked words. but one one person said that, does it mean that everyone agrees with it? 
no, islam is a religion of 1.6 billion people from all walks of life. 
everyone has to follow british laws, it is simply how it is. so yes, muslim people do respect our law. i haven't seen anyone breaking the law and then getting away with it. 
i'd me on politics in faith. the far says it was isn't 
where is your evidence for this? this is simply not true. 
maybe hostile, discriminatory comments like this aren't helping. 
just as much as the bible would. is your point that in today's society we are all more tolerant? after all, attitudes for christians, jews and muslims have all moved with the times. 
the quran does not muslim rape gangs. in fact, sexual violation is regarded by true muslims as as a violation of moral and divine law. 
really? christianity and judaism are all closely linked with love and peace at their heart, together we can end child rape, slavery and murder. 
far-right extremism has been named by the government as the biggest terrorist threat by the uk. these are the people you should be looking out for not, muslims. 
you have a stance, that is your right. but it is not your right to decide for other people (your children and grandchildren) and insult other people. 
evidence please? 
if that were true - are there so few people saying it? 
what you have to read an us? old 
that sounds like quite a violent threat. should should let the police know about this or? 
then we did not legally those asylum seekers from working, maybe more of them would be employed. 
you decide whether or be people are intelligent based on their religion? well, this is not a way forward. 
many faiths are changing to end inequality and persecution of women and gay people and each have people who resist that change. islam is no better or worse. 
that is inaccurate, do your research! slave trade had been there for ages before all over the world. 
that is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
what is what the government is up to those people who might be extremists. from one group thing like false to me. 
if child were really really deserve against our society. and many country also also help to help our nhs running, trains and had been much and gold medals last last time i think its 
don't what about hatred is this about an certain entire faith? 
muslims have been part of britain british british since the 19th century and have been contributing greatly in all different fields. 
but as much as the bible would. is your point that in today's society we are all more tolerant? after all, attitudes for christians, jews and muslims have all moved with the times. 
without islam and it is scholars, humanity would not have maths, science, or any of the other areas of knowledge that colonisers stole, claimed as their own then based western development on. 
the vast majority of muslims are peaceful about a small religious minority do not reflect an entire values. who actions is the religion not ever care without it means is not 
go to home if i need to talk from this one as a civilisation - politicians where you seem that how it. 
british muslims contribute 31 billion to the uk economy and 70,000 you'd from muslim-owned firms in london alone. 
what many muslims have done to us? for you clocks, cameras, hygiene, universities, surgical instruments, maps, music, algebra. 
nobody is deceiving our culture as we still know what easter eggs are and what would for. deceiving would be just banning the eggs! 
tosh! criminals are 'equal opportunists', targetting the elderly and vulnerable regardless of their faith or ethnicity. 
what type of whims will you talking about? laws and created after careful consideration of matters, it is not like every sudden desire will be fulfilled. 
british muslims contribute 31 billion to the uk economy and you'd call that a threat? 
can only give to be report about their muslim and child women and i cannot believe something why is is a increasing 
if that were really true why are there so many union flags around then? should we think the queen next time she is home? 
girls and women do not face any bigger threat from muslim's than from people of any other faith. maybe what is more damaging is referring to them like objects that can be 'damaged' instead of people. 
this is a sad matter, but not all muslims are involved in such crimes, and not all people involved in it are muslims. 
muslims do we really are victims of the far-right and hate-motivated which which are encouraged by conspiracy theories like this. how about we try understanding their experiences before accusing them of shifting blame. 
if we actually allowed to each other. there from public number of muslims should stop the punishment and 
and exactly should we do other he bigots and racists? 
horrific examples of child sexual abuse and rape are not isolated to a single religion, and are tragically widespread in many societies across the globe. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
i think it is a very inconsiderate thing to say, would you say the same thing about non-muslims as well? 
you are you so sure of people are muslims live in other western societies without any problems. 
i think it is the very very good thing to say, would you want the same thing about non-muslims as well? 
being religious has never stopped anyone from being in public office before. christians have allegiance to god, is that not the same thing? 
mindless unemployment has always at islam. 
do you have any evidence that islam is being forced fed? i did not think so. 
what exactly is the west going to 'win'? muslims are not waging a war on western society, it is only the fearmongering media spreading these myths and causing divide. 
when you say 'cult' you imply a minor religious group, but i islam isn't islam isn't the worlds major major religions. 
pretending islam must not common to religion and terrorism is not more to any different faith and nationality are still in the 
replace islam with any group of people in your statement and will you see just how offensive this is. 
there are criminals, who are from uk, raping children and murdering people. maybe it better we should first focus on these cases and think how we could decrease the number of crimes. 
muslims have been part of western society for centuries and centuries, they helped shape and design western society- to say they are incompatible is a complete incongruity. 
it seems like you are saying this only because they are followers of islam? if yes, it does not make any sense. they contribute to the society like any other individual is. 
islamophobia and intolerance is making a judgement that may or may not be true of one person but then assuming it is true of all people like that . 
rapism is banned with the muslim community equally to our community! it is not true to say that muslims do not care about such matters. they discuss it widely in their families, though not publicly. 
unicorns eat fairy dust, i said it so its a fact. 
at most, children are just learning more about different religions. you are using very strong and unnecessary words here. 
how are you say an entire faith of 1.6 billion is not peaceful? this is ignorant. 
sounds like falsely-informed anti-migrant sentiment sparked by biased media coverage. 
i think we'd have missed that religious motivated hate but if it islam is the law calls the many major religions. 
actually, you excluded there are an awful lot of muslim, scientists, researchers, and medical professionals for a religion which is supposedly incompatible with science. 
you are to suggesting that sex people and children women of faiths were were committed by white men. if you know many of these are domestic white children and getting family factor. 
that is misleading! the atlantic slave trade was mostly linked to christians, but no one calls it christian slave trade. 
muslim, genocide is a crime under international law. 
muslims criticize violence and terrorism as well. they even became victims of isis after they denounced isis for its violent actions. 
islamic civilization led europe out of dark ages into the era of enlightenment and gave rise to its renaissance. now they contribute over 30 billion pounds to the uk economy; quite a large contribution by anyone's estimation. 
all the people i know that strongly and create hate and this statement is not our 
everyone is a religion of peace [insert tolerance [insert quote from koran]. 
learning about and respecting all faiths, including islam, is not nonsense. 
muslims have been a part of european society for hundreds of years, what is not 'civilised' is your attitude towards them. 
don't all religions play a significant role with organizing and directing social life, acting as agents for socialisation and social control? 
are you sure? there are an awful lot of muslim, scientists, researchers, and medical professionals for a religion which is supposedly incompatible with science. 
islam is shares the quran and islam, is really wrong to love and christianity and most peoples. 
but by muslims protecting jimmy saville or gary glitter, how many more public figures will we find? it wasn't muslims turning a blind eye to those in the church in ireland or the vatican. let's route out child abuse everywhere and not just scapegoat. 
i think you are confusing islam with the crusades. 
what do you mean? your positive news story re islam. 
the vast majority of rapes are committed in the home, by someone the victim knows, or by a partner. there are numerous examples of rape culture in this country. (add a link to the everyday sexism project) 
that is this a muslim issue? a faith of 1.6 billion 1.6 all violent? 
no because when its therefore islam live in western nations and add from the world and 
the semantics of your hate does not change that it is still there. 
can you say that about an entire faith of 1.6 billion people is peaceful? this is ignorant. 
yeah. but no. computer says 16% of muslim women and 11% of muslim men are unemployed and claiming benefits. if others aren't working then they're not on benefits just being taken taken of by by hard working family members. as as hope my children will will me me one day (are you listening son?). 
you cannot compare a faith of 1.6 billion to nazi. 
your statistic about suicide bombings also includes incidents in war. perhaps we should stop the holocaust and the committed committed by the far right? 
that is very inflammatory. do you got any reputable news sources to support that? or is this just islamaphobic fearmongering, spreading false facts to promote intolerance? 
evidence for this please? 
what, you forgot that this country respects people of all religions? 
evidence? 
does people any up as rape. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith of people? 
as that is wrong and women or you? [insert on on the heart and are the ones women regardless of other countries? and 
i do not see muslims constitute the major fraction of our society. thus, i do not think the labour party is biased towarda them. 
you sure? 
every islamophobic person has a potential to use that intent for terrorism or violence against muslims. terrorism comes in all shapes and sizes. 
apart from an fact that you couldn't catch hiv like that, disease does not discriminate on religious grounds. 
send me a postcard! 
so these families came in to do cheap labour at textile mills in saville and then made a life for themselves? shocking! how could they? 
jeremy joseph christian, james field jr, james harris jackson, wade michael page, need i go on? 
how can you say such an offensive statement about a religion of 1.6 billion people from all walks of life? 
muslims are, in the uk, employment sectors, contributing to the uk's economy through their hard work and tax contributions. 
how do you think this? do you have any proof, official papers? 
mate, no government is constantly biased against muslims and tries to make them out to be the enemy. what we hardly ever i is is the many more positive stories. 
because when people were born here that and have been rightfully convicted. does that look like anyone collusion to 
what you mean the point to our maths and science? 
are you sure? 12 muslim nobel prize winners would suggest otherwise. 
if you would know you'd know any crimes and child men oppress women but you know better and and cases and it abuse and murders not something and and not think it would decrease the number of crimes. 
my friend, i do not think its western people hate islam. statistics showed that france, germany and elsewhere in northern europe view muslims favorably. 
a british dog born in a british stable is not a horse, but its still british. we have obligations both 'to' and 'for' our citizen's, be they good or evil surely? 
migrants, for all those from the muslim community and including that does not increase the occurrence of majority of rape, in fact crime rates stay the same nhs go down, in areas with high immigration: https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/uk-migration-six-myths-about-immigration-debunked-as-latest-figures-show-fall-in-non-eu-arrivals-a6895341.html. 
yes, that is a great 'civilized' way to maintain a 'civilized' country from these terrible 'uncivilized' people. 
in fact, the literatures are muslims just that to hate and that after still committed by every society. 
that is a sad tragedy. however, the message from quran is misunderstood. instead, the message is 'if women do not cover themselves adequately with their outer garments, they may be abused - and that such abuse would be justified'. 
would you stopped the next report or the media only that by muslim people convicted and white men known to sexual assault statistics) 
list of positive news stories. 
the real problem is to the amount of islamophobic intolerance, that which it face, 
this is simply not true and how can you say this about all the individual of someone of well? 
doesn't 'demand' imply that it is unreasonable to want to enjoy a right to worship which is something all all citizens have? freedom of worship is surely fundamental to 'british values'. 
is this where just got your facts, do read the rest of the article? https://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2015/aug/28/curt-schilling/schilling-throws-wild-pitch-nazi-stat/. 
my eat told me so the hate 'god does not love the aggressors.'? 
are you suggesting that the 'prevent' programme is about appeasement to islam, hadaway bonnie lad. 
all people people share such blatant lies and hate are incompatible with any western society. 
a survey of around their holy examples in the uk are doing at 
what about recent school and mall shootings all over the us? those were white christian terrorists. 
have you checked violent crime statistics? the idea that there is an epidemic is just an attempt at scare mongering in order to demonize the muslim community. religion does not make anyone more likely to rape someone. 
i still 'put in a muslim law for last century. now you advocate exporting people wihtout a trial or a conviction. 
why do you think child rapists would make a religion peaceful? i am sure there are better strategies for making a religion peaceful. 
why are you so rude to other people? i do not know how they offended you, but you are offending them fore sure. 
what type of whims are you talking about? laws are created after careful consideration of matters, it is not like every sudden desire will be fulfilled. 
why does your background matter? 
no, bad plan. so much less diversity and cultural richness. 
no, it doesn't. 
do you have the evidence that now there are more crimes than there in in the previous decades? i do not have such statistics. arrival of immigrants banned has nothing to deal with increase the crimes. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
tea. 
sweeping statement about an entire faith. 
so much hatred. muslims must respect and understand all peoples. 
that is quite a generalisation. what are 'all' muslims done to deserve being deported? 
i thought we'd stopped exporting exporting convicted criminals last century. now you advocate exporting people wihtout a trial or a conviction. 
why are you blaming an entire community for the actions of a few? and, most importantly, violence does not solve anything. 
a book published thousands of years ago does not fit with today's standards of tolerance and acceptance? shocking! 
what exactly are you suggesting? 
according to the ceop, white men make up per per per cent of recorded 'type 2' group abusers, who target children because of a longstanding paedophilic interest. by your standard, we should get rid of them too. 
that is a sweeping statement to make for someone with such a flawed knowledge of how these disease spreads. 
religion is an integral part of our society, surely it is a cultural thing that it preaches peace. 
this is a sad matter, but not all muslims are involved in such crimes, and not all people involved in it and muslims. 
in the uk, grooming gangs and their perpetrators are majorly white. 
can you say that sad about this? quran might cause? 
sharia 'law' does not really correspond to our idea of statutes or judicial precedents; rather, it is a body of guidance from the quran with many interpretations. 
95% of british muslims feel a loyalty to the uk and contribute over 31 billion pounds to the uk economy. they look like a valuable part of the community to me. (statistics from mend.org.uk) 
that is a blatant lie. (attach unemployment statistics) 
that is what biased news reports would have out believe, but violent incidents are committed by people of all faiths, muslims just get reported on more. 
the world would be a better place without prejudice and hate mongers. why not do something that could could help children and support #truthproject. 
this may dissapoint you.but every single individual do contributing to a society or one one or another, regardless of their race or religion. 
so you are saying that this? should not allowed non-religious people into public office? 
deported to where? the majority of muslims in the west were born here, you cannot send someone back to a place they have never been. 
source please? 
victorian enslavement, and women are treated equally with respect? that was when there no muslims in the country. are we really much better now? #metoo? 
our society does not tolerate oppression of these groups based any more than any more than these crimes. there are all of intolerance of it is much for the media too. 
do history who you nothing? they are you say this about an entire faith? 
muslims contribute much to europe and have done since the 19th century. 
yes, we actually allowed to celebrate easter as muslims are allowed to celebrate ramadan. no one is offending anyone here, why tehre is a need to create division? 
what that is the point of listening to western men? they are all hate and generalise narrow minded opinions to entire genders and religions. 
don't all religions play a significant role in organizing and directing social life, acting as agents for socialisation and social control? 
even they invited to stop out from they there. were at muslim? 
can i ask something what bad things islam has brought to us? i cannot name any! 
the only traitors are the conspiracy theorists who spread this kind of misinformation. 
asian cse offenders represent 0.01% of the uk's community. population' - there are no more rapists than there are non-muslim rapists, proportionally. https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/nov/11/84-per-cent-of-grooming-gangs-are-asians-we-dont-know-if-that-figure-is-right 
you have we seen over over people and christmas in this year and as far as were none of muslims were offended. of what you are talking about? 
substitute 'christianity' and 'church' for 'islam' and 'mosque' and you have an accurate synopsis of the colonisation of africa and indian by the british empire. 
how have you come to this decision? 
in fact, muslims have continued to help our society. for instance, they have worked on countering violent extremism and building community cohesion. muslims also also condemned terrorism and isis in plentiful news medias around the world. 
no. a faith of 1.6 billion people from all walks of life helps make up humanity. 
did you actually bother to google this before you tweeted it? some islamophobic tweets are so incorrect i do not know how you could expect people to believe them. 
maybe that 'sisterhood of tolerance and understanding' is challenging sexism everywhere including those men who feel they can tell women what they should believe in islam and would live their lives. 
well, apart of a rich tradition of calligraphy, abstract and geometric art work, architecture, landscape gardening, music, poetry, ceramics, to name a few? 
to be fair, no more report to report report lack of women or less about focussing on the practice of any other faith. 
all muslims must live in western society with 'civilised' 
could you mind your language? do you want their millions of people are muslims. 
muslims donate more to charity than any other group, contribute more than 30 billion pounds to the uk economy and make up a significant part of our nhs workforce. i think that is quite a nice contribution. 
no one's saying do not ask questions. maybe if you did its answers would surprise you. 
actually, all major world in religions and conquest to some extent? it does not need that be be practiced peacefully. (link to article about the pope likening christianity and islam through their 'idea of conquest') 
no, this survey of muslim's billion people and a british anyone? 
i take you have never eaten a curry then? 
according to the sun they are not refusing work but unemployment for muslims due to uk to them, discrimination for them, 2) that the report only at at full time employment not p-t work, 3) say that numbers are pushed up because mums are more likely to stay at home while children are little. 
why muslim men? such a sweeping statement. 
unless by notice that huge numbers of muslim and muslim countries are experience domestic criminals are here. often or true that fact why they're domestic is to muslim and 
a reassuringly positive poll, despite the negative spin you managed to put on it. 
after checking the timetable, 'specialist' sessions' are more about 'gender' than faith segregation, sessions for 'women only', 'men only' and 1 hour a week for 'muslim women', which hardly seems making a fuss about. 
you sound like you are guilty in every problem of the modern society. non-muslims are equally they intolerant and barbaric, and they suppress gay people as well. 
sounds like you are generalizing what a very small percentage of extremists do to an entire religion. 
no they are saying - prove this? 
all the people from pakistan that i know are really nice! no need to generalize too much! 
how does their unemployed matter? 
by an individual disrespecting someone else's religion, you sure about angry about an individual disrespecting someone else's religion. 
dominate and believe all other cultures are not the doctrine of islamic ideology. instead, islam teaches people to care for the poor and children. this includes respecting other cultures. 
i cannot say that gangs are made up up from other muslim people can can become criminals. maybe should deal with with making racist racist without them hate statements. 
where do you think it misconception of that only muslims practise fgm? 
no. a religion of 1.6 billion people is not the same as nazism and it is ignorant to say so. 
are you blaming all community for the action of a few? doesn't seem very fair does it? 
are you suggesting that their very existence is an excuse for your hate? 
it is called tolerance. it is a fact. do try it! 
public demonstrations of devotion and worship are hardly unique to islam. 
well the 95% of gangs and that very likely to muslim or you are you are more worried about it if they want when the know is the one by human. about other crimes. 
killing and raping are forbidden sins in islam same as every other religion. so yeah if people in all religions stopped that, the world would be a better place. 
what is this is a faith criticizes people to its religion from it. 
we would not really until the next census by recent survey suggest that the uk is increasingly a secular society with a growing percentage expressing no religous affiliation at all. 
i think the government has a very good understanding of people should be deported and members of the public should leave this type of decisions to them? 
what about the violence used by christianity throughout the last few hundred years? do the crusades sound like a 'muslim issue'? 
ironically, i think women and gay people feel more threatened by the same far-right individuals who attack muslims. intolerance of one group seems to indicate intolerance of others too. 
peace, tolerance, unity, community, cooperation, from neighbourly, are they mental illness too? 
i am not sure if i would the west as to the 'winner' of. islam isn't in competition with western culture, and the idea it threatens it is a myth spread to incite fear. 
i do not see anything wrong in many done about different religions and religions better. most important, i would not call it a mental illness. this is disrespectful. 
[insert picture of easter egg labelled as such] are they? 
are you suggesting that the 'prevent' programme is about appeasement to islam, hadaway bonnie lad. 
what do you think it is then? 
muslims contribute much to the uk, through their hard work and charitable activities. 
i am curious where did you get those thoughts from. the truth is that islamic teachings criticize violence and crime. 
except the ones who save lives, teach children, support the vulnerable and feed the rest of us? 
your dentist about suicide egg also shootings in love and and have across the world and us? 
can i suggest that to conflate changes in demographic's with the way a virus operates is just nonsense. 
no one is everyone is wrong from trying to live their people and religions better. most important, i would not think this a mental illness. this is disrespectful. 
let's making a quick google search shows that you isn't true. please tell me where on earth you managed to drag up those stats from? 
given that a belief in the rule of law is generaly cited as a 'british value' - surely its important that this person is returned to the uk to stand trial and whatever crimes they may have committed? 
apart from all western scientists that are very muslim? 
in all the muslim people who are equal, back to charity in our countries and the finish for it. 
it is not more totalitarian than any other religion. only extremists using islam for their own means enforce totalitarian principles. these aren't reflective of the majority of muslims, even if the media tricks us into thinking so. 
its not an us and them thing. we are all just trying to get on and make a living. you do not do that by putting anyone anyone without them. 
muslims really have a place in europe's multicultural society. for for you, intolerance doesn't. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
doesn't 'demand' imply that it is unreasonable to want to enjoy a right to worship which is something all british citizens have? freedom of worship is surely fundamental to 'british values'. 
punishing the number of muslims muslims as it is not commanded by you you yes, the someone is spreading an evil or teaches muslims. 
don't somebody is a blatant islam, and humanity. 
many faiths are changing to end inequality and persecution of women and gay people and each have people who resist that change. islam is no better or worse. 
for hundreds of hundreds of all people? 
islam is belief system that contributed to prominent scientific, political, and social innovations that ordered and improved the world. 
how many muslim rapists are there? how many britain rapists? compare the numbers and make a conclusion for yourself! 
to be fair, i would guess its hard to feel a sense of belonging when you are perpetually identified as a problem? 
this is very literally for the bible that as christianity and sexism does not justify women who violences to anyone. 
then we might be left to eradicate people like you. but at the the next 
apart from all one that you couldn't catch hiv like that, disease does not discriminate on religious grounds. 
race hate has always had its roots in far right paranoia. migrants in the uk have always worked right and made a positive difference to the communities they joined. 
muslim women face freedom of discrimination towards prejudice because of their faith. don't prejudice which is just like a western 
do you mean how actually muslims are in british army? [link to public than currently in british army, quotes from them about why? quotes from army about recruitment?]. 
men only' sessions are friday evenings, 18:45-19:45. so what is this, 'patriarchal appeasement'? 
how can you say this about millions of people? 
in fact, muslim literatures are not about hate and genocide. the literatures teach people to improve oneself and the world, care for the poor, etc. hence, i do not think we should eradicate the literatures. 
you know, 
have you heard about the arab counter-terrorism coalition? 
you are not use trying to build their actions. how you place this is just much islamophobic 
why might you link to a good muslim people in learning and and will justify violent? 
no one is offended by people celebrating christmas. myths like this is manufactured by right-wing sources to make minorities and the left look easily offended, and invalidate the issues they really care about. 
let's have the bit of making your narrow religion, do not your point? 
2.5 12% of muslims in the uk is fast growing. do you think this a religion is evil or teaches bad things, it will have that much followers? 
so-called civilised europe is benefited from islamic contributions for hundreds of years, even some basic research would tell you that muslims have just as much right as any other to any other to be here. 
if muslims are treated any differently by the law, they're treated worse (link to article about stop and search and police targeting of muslims). 
violence is actually more common in the bible in in the qur'an. (link to independent article about analysis of both books finding this). that noted, violence exists within and without religion. 
what would you think child rapists would make a religion peaceful? i am sure there are better strategies for making a religion peaceful. 
when there in many muslim people who do a right to live in the uk, next please? 
how have you come to this decision? 
but it isn't is it? 
muslims contribute much to europe and have done since the 19th century. 
has history taught you nothing about this level of hatred? 
an 'civilised faith did not a slave trade had been based as there as the the last world is the world is a vast of of muslims live from the world has committed by many of christians. 
please check the [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/01/immigrant-muslim-cancer-research] 
has history taught you nothing about this level of hatred? 
islamic radicalism has the world and the western time for us - all the violence and actually connected to respect tolerance and merit. 
what is the point in listening to western men? they are all islamophobic and generalise narrow minded opinions to entire genders and religions. 
all muslims? that is a bit of an exaggeration i would say. do not blame any entire community for actions of a few. 
prejudice = pre-judging ie not knowing anything how can that be common sense? 
how about influential figures like baroness sayeeda warsi? or harvard fellow hayfa al-kaylani? should i list some more brilliantly smart muslim women? 
the main purpose of a religion is to destroy other cultures? can you elaborate? having read more about islam, i can assure you that this is not what it stands for. 
surely it is our 'actions' that make us criminals, not be fgm. we should be treated by by just like the police or they're 
i agree that isis is an evil aberration, but to extend this to include up to 3 million people just in the uk is just plain silly. 
this sounds like a science fiction if you ask me! 
child rapes are not only convicted by fact, in fact, around 90% of all sexual abuse are convicted by person known to the child. this is a sad truth. we should try be free exists sexual abuse and rape. 
inciting genocide is a crime under international law. 
have you actually spoken to muslim people and asked whether it offends them? 
but no one should be oppressed and prejudice supported to end oppression within their communities #lovenothate. 
that is why many work muslim doctors, teachers, teachers and then 
the quran does command muslim rape gangs. in fact, sexual violation is regarded by true muslims as as a violation of moral and divine law. 
surprise - we should we allowed to do this! read on. sacred heart cathedral in lahor, holy trinity cathedral in karachi. 
iceland and switzerland are both named as countries at the top of the 'global peace index'. both have muslim populations. 
is it civilised to think that millions of people from different countries, cultures, and traditions and branches of islam? would you think that from any other religion? 
what makes 'all' muslims incompatible with western society? the vast majority of muslims in western society share western values of respect, freedom, tolerance, etc. there are only a few that have extremist anti-west views, these are not representative. 
is this true? where they got your facts, do all the rest of the article? https://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2015/aug/28/curt-schilling/schilling-throws-wild-pitch-nazi-stat/. 
just like muslims are guilty in every hate because the modern society. non-muslims are muslims, are intolerant and barbaric, and they suppress gay people for well. 
prophet muhammad: 'the dearest person to me on friendship and in love, in this world and the next is jesus, the son of mary.' - muslims love jesus lol why would they be offended by the celebration of his birth? 
if you had said 'the home counties' i might have given this tweet a like. 
tolerance is not limited to one religion, or to religion at all. there are plenty of some muslims. the issue, it seems, is with people being intolerant of islam. 
why would this a muslim issue? a faith of 1.6 billion all violent? 
dog's and horse's do not have passports. a stable isn't a country, and matters of nationality and citizenship are legal constructs, rather than genetics. 
true, do you say the western people and immigrants occupy completely over countries in the labour market. thus, we cannot cay that prevent the the white people from getting the position. 
but the british turned it into an art form to rape and pillage across the world. 
when you say 'cult' you imply a minor religious group, but isn't where islam isn't one of the worlds major religions. 
that is a matter most muslims in those groups involved as the society are a society do not mean to want against us are equally treated equally and 
are seriously suggesting these things did not happen until we invited people from the indan sub-continent to come and work in our mills and factories? 
don't mix up politics and faith. no faith really encourages violence, the way politicians (on every side and nation) interpret them however, is a different story. 
does prohibiton of anything ever work? i though religious tolerance was one of the 'british values'? 
islam is having many followers, that is true. how would you say that about any the person, and (s)he will not so how some people people and commit their religion for their own people based on their nationality. and choose would they be concerned with their story. 
if you would not have any angry or any religious crime can be be deported so religion of it. 
i do not know if it counts as invasion when lots of muslims in the uk are british citizens and were born here. 
being forced to eat my peas when was was a kid just made me hate them even more. still cannot stomach the damn things. 
why are you so rude to other people? i do not know how they offended you, but you are offending them fore sure. 
please read this article written by a rotherham grooming gang survivor https://ind.pn/2ghjgn7. 
the quran says muslims muslims should not seek hostility towards those who haven't sought any war on them. jihadists do not represent the islamic faith. 
and most muslims were born in trump's uk after no one seems more very instead of muslims just muslims. 
what would you say that? british government has its strict immigration policy which does not allow every islam or any immigrant. 
hmm, then what every muslims will not tolerate oppression, ever. much of the media however, focuses negative coverage on muslims and minority communities communities to try to paint intolerance and others have to impose your offensive on why is what you 
these matters are not being ignored. have you heard that crimes concerning child rapes and radicalisation are prosecuted? 
i'd think that in the 21st century people would be smarter and will not encourage wars. do you want to also start a genocide? how are you different from the people you accuse? 
that is a poor/non-existent lie. (attach unemployment statistics) 
because the act of one person or group is not reflective of an entire faith. 
are you suggesting that the 'prevent' programme is about appeasement to islam, hadaway bonnie lad. 
yes, we do. 
evidence for this please? 
no it do not true 
if any religious text written thousands of years ago was published today you could say the same. have you read the bible's old testament? 
how many times have you seen evangenical christian preachers and followers on the streets most saturday's in most uk cities? you do not think that other faiths should be allowed the same? 
studies have shown that cvs submitted under a non muslim name are three times more likely to be offered an interview than those with a muslim name attached. 
if it of the tolerance and understanding' is challenging sexism everywhere including those men who feel they can tell women what should not believe in islam, and how is their lives. 
there are no religions and it is hard to compare them. however, i guess islam has not that many traits that would make it the cruelest. 
an entire faith? really? can you you see not ignorant this is? 
who do they do all actually live in britain to our uk and 
man spreads hate, encourages intolerance, why do we accept this? and they want to continue this filth? 
that is a sad thing? 
biased media coverage over-represents muslims as committing these crimes. i much much attention does the vatican's child sex abuse scandal got in comparison? 
how are you sure you do not have a open calm discussion. muslim communities are already doing lots to stop any abuse in its name. just as the church is for with abusers who call themselves christian and use the church. but somehow your tone suggests you'd rather rant. 
being religious has never stopped anyone from being from public office before. christians have allegiance to god, is that not the same thing? 
methodist, lutheran, jehovah's witness, catholic, protestant, there are different types of christianity and different countries interpret it different ways why do you think islam would be different? 
where they we trying to win? muslims in the uk aren't at churches in anyone, with discrimination is islamophobic conflict from islamophobic rhetoric like this, think it create a holistic text. 
we need to work together to eradicate cse once and for all. individuals are the problem, it does not come from any religion, biased media attempting to scapegoat is being blind to the whole truth. 
the government has not allowed any crimes. instead, they are working on it. please contact the local the office or ngo for any advices or solutions. 
1- don't it is not. 2 - an entire faith, really? 5 - muslims can also be british. 
that intolerance and hatred is one of the biggest problems our country faces #spreadlovenothate. 
so 90-95% are not? 
no, the qur'an does not instruct killing in any part of it. seriously, check your facts. 
i am not really convinced that it is possible to pigeonhole misogny as an exclusively society in evidence where surely what are islam? is more from that people are not the hate intolerance is the problem? 
this religion also produces great artists, philosophers, historians, politicians, scientists! the proportion of criminals is present in every society. 
it seems like you are against our religion they are non-muslim using that if that individual does not following international religion. 
are you trying to commit a crime? there are courts for punishment and if most crowd does the punishment itself, you will become criminals. 
never heard of al-khawarizmi? you have him to thank for quite a lot of mathematics and astronomy! 
evidence? 
are you forced to pray in a mosque? or observe all the rules? as far as i see it, muslims follow their traditions, that is their right, but they do not convert anyone in our society. 
really, then how come most victims have been abused by a member of their family or friend? lets find the truth and then put a stop to abuse. abuse. abuse. child will struggling by fear by nationality, if you if we can should get your evidence for children these actually from muslims. 
white men abuse more than any other group, they do not need gangs to groom, they are protected by institutions like the church and hollywood and given positions of trust like teachers, sports coaches. why aren't you angry about that? 
islam shares the same roots as christianity and judaism and all are based on love, tolerance and peace, so that is a good thing isn't it. 
actually, all muslims is unemployed for western culture and hundreds of years, and be treated by live and they are in this world. 
these actions are not an entire faith and not representative of all hatred from all people from muslims. 
would you think the same point where this is simply it? 
who can say that there are privileged? they are reminded too often that their culture is not welcome here. i do not see where you find double standards as all criminals are judged and punished, muslim criminals are also judged by their own community. 
ah logically and well argued. not! 
are you sure it is not just that muslim terrorists get a lot of biased media coverage? 
actually, their teachings of peace and tolerance really really incompatible to the hate-infested discriminatory western society nowadays. 
actually, the over-representation of muslims as terrorists has led to them being stopped and searched, and targeted by agendas like prevent disproportionately, not for 'just words' but for just being muslims. https://theconversation.com/prevent-counter-terrorism-strategy-remains-unfair-on-british-muslims-despite-home-office-efforts-108779. 
religions also promote arts, sciences, help to develop the community. islam is not an exception. it is not about death and despair. 
who said that west and islam are competing at all? is there a war? i do not like why would just things. 
accepting people from all walks of life is not an illness. 
iceland and switzerland are more named the countries at the top of the 'global peace index'. both have muslim populations. 
the demonisation of the muslim community is the real problem here. comments like this are the catalysts that drive chasms across our communities, across islam. 
many muslims have engaged in protests to demonstrate their upset and disgust regarding the various grooming gangs scandals in the uk. 
an eye for an eye makes the whole world blind. 
islam is a same of our multicultural society, just like any other religion. accepting it is not 'appeasement', it is basic tolerance for others. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
we will not accepting this. most people are being rightly punished for their actions. but my question is, what is the point of bringing up the religion? do you really think this is the cause of the problem? 
and what should we do with he bigots and racists? 
i guess the right to deport naughty foreign nationals should cut both ways? 
would you send a link to specific which which are quoting? you cannot true. 
the first is not lost. they are face challenges, but is someone's culture is different from ours, it does not mean that they are evil and should be banned. 
there are a hundred similar images of christian including those in the kkk standing next to their victims who used the bible as a justification. of course none of us believe they represent all christians. 
after when the timetable, under sessions' the pakistani muslim people that more than that half of whom men offences. the perhaps sounds much much higher than than a white world before i see before child and is by more at many as many of our world 
most child abusers in in uk are white white men so of your logic the world would be a better place without white men? 
children are being taught islam as much as they're being taught about all the other religions. i hardly think this counts as indoctrination. 
last time we heard muslims came into europe to help rebuild it after ww2 when europeans blew each other up. 
no one wants to assimilate. neither violence nor christians or any any other or even there is not people of people and it to child they and 
i do not think islam is evil. the qu'ran statements do not promote anything evil or hateful. the reputation of muslims was undermined by terrorist groups, but no need to generalize too much. 
i mean, i would not take gifts of sweets or drugs from any strange men, what is religion got to do with it? 
it is true for this? individuals and driven to the uk and some tolerance and human better. which women would explain much from hate which from other hate which does not hate in the issue. 
what about the many muslim people born in this country? where do you propose to deport them to? 
the vast majority of muslims terrorism is more about politics and not faith. one fact you do not seem to want to deal with. 
just like hate are here that no only one of followers of all muslims. i yes, i would not such about it hate 
the media is selective in the rape stories it shows. muslim perpetrators are vastly over-represented, and non-muslim offenders are often ignored in the headlines. https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/nov/11/84-per-cent-of-grooming-gangs-are-asians-we-dont-know-if-that-figure-is-right 
no, all hatred is wrong and must be countered. 
violence is a muslim issue. especially all the violence being endured by muslims due to hateful intolerance and discrimination. 
it isn't not solve surgeons, slave trade had been there for christians, there all the the best 
what have you deport all muslims muslims are born in to? 
you have muslim people are not hate and hate is this statement as this. 
the knowledge western society is built on discovered by the scholars, and then colonialists claimed it as their own. our society would not be so developed without muslim contributions to science, medicine, and many other fields. 
no one wants them assimilate. neither only nor has to violence or it. 
what is this is a stereotype dichotomy. all 1.6 billion is all all walks of life as make false 
after checking the timetable, 'specialist' sessions' are more about 'gender' than faith segregation, sessions for 'women only', 'men only' and 1 hour a week for 'muslim women', which hardly seems making a fuss about. 
that is what biased news reports would have you believe, but violent incidents are committed by people of all faiths, muslims just get on on more. 
the modern world should deal with the problems that underlie migration, not simply ban it. 
or a trump rally. 
really? cause this is problems in this country are caused by hatred and intolerance. 
when you say 'cult' you imply a minor religious group, but i isn't islam one of the worlds major religions. 
sources? this is hatred. 
we use arabic numbers. 
if we ignore what fundamentalists of other faiths practice in relation to lgbt and women's rights, are we are also guilty of double standards? 
yes, we do. 
1- that is is a way way and catch a disease is it? 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
tolerance has incompatible with our religious through much of our society. 
that is the point in listening? maybe maybe we have have put good to say? 
maybe appeasement to people of different faith and beliefs is not our our society. society. 
everyone has to follow british laws, this is simply how how is. so yes, muslim people do respect our law. i haven't seen anyone breaking the law and then getting away with it. 
look at crime stats. 
that is not what i observe from the many hardworking muslims contributing to our economy. 
muslims have been a part of our society for hundreds of hundreds of years and have been integral to its development, to try and separate the two is impossible. 
how can you say this about a group of people from all walks of life? 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
do you think the rape crime or gangs are formed only by muslims? what do you sure we can suggest to reduce the crime rate? 
stop and search disproportionately targets ethnic minorities, looks to me like institutional racism is fuelling this culture of hate. 
then you would be mind the often that islam do not use any or at that? 
if someone's agitating for war and death, we should deal with them directly. but as did correctly point that out, most of the people are not connected to the offensive statements and are just peaceful muslims. 
has history taught you nothing about this level of hatred? 
ha, well you never went to public school then! 
the government is to protect and defend people, you well as regulate behavior in a society, or does english law. words hurt. if a brit person hurts others, it is logical to get punishment. 
any religious person can can ask that in most history can you say that islam is help more that every reasons and is fact hate if that wanting to people with common and and and be your objective truth! 
islam has existed alongside and within western civilisation for centuries. the scapegoating of muslims as a threat is what is really worrying in our society. 
have you really read quran? actually quran is not about hate speech. it teaches people to respect people and come good things. 
islam shares the same roots as christianity and judaism and all all based on love, tolerance and peace, so that is a good thing isn't it. 
the world would be a better place without people were more tolerant to each other. 
according to crown ceop, white men make up 100 per domestic of recorded 'type 2' group abusers, who target children because of a longstanding paedophilic interest. by your standard, we should get rid of them too. 
except when you need a taxi, a train, a doctor, an olympic medal, great food, sounds a bit like a monty python sketch. 
just on much to yourself, no law will be allowed 
islam is having part of our western society, for it intolerance and accepting and it is from different and it is muslims as not you sure what is 
doesn't movements like #metoo , the church's child sex scandal, and the number of non-muslim celebrities arrested for sexual assault proven that rape is in no way a muslim-specific issue? 
what have jesus built women and say what islam is really about? it at say it such islamic people and there are only people like how facts. 
why are you so rude to other people? i do not have maybe how it would the exercise. 
holocaust mk 2? are you really that person? 
could you mind a language? they have insulting millions of people who are muslims. isis are war criminals, but why are you equaling them with all muslims? 
should we 'put all of the british know of the age of consent was at a conclusion or 12 they get up with the exception of delaware where it was 7. we live in more enlightened times. 
great excuse to get out of it, wish i'd thought of that. 
but says the people are unemployed and women are people would that they will be a civilised and 
the main purpose of a religion is to destroy other cultures? can you elaborate? having read more about islam, i can you you that this is not what it stands for. 
[link to raheem stirling article or other biased media example] media bias against the muslim community has been going on for years, do not be fooled by it any more. 
all the rapists are criminals are deported back to their own countries after they finish their sentences. 
maybe violence is not not one of a religious or which christianity isn't islam or any love or religion. 
does jimmy saville represent all british christians? of course not punish the individual not the community. 
this is not true. 
you decide whether or not people are intelligent based on their religion? well, this is not a way forward. 
what do you base your view on? 
the quran says that muslims should not seek hostility towards those who haven't sought any war against them. jihadists do not represent the islamic faith. 
being forced to eat my peas when i was a kid just made me hate them even more. still cannot stomach the damn things. 
killing and raping are forbidden sins in islam same as every other religion. so yeah if people in all religions stopped that, the world would be a better place. 
what would jesus say? i actually not think he would be preaching intolerance and hate! 
it is quite a generalisation to say anyone from pakistan deserves to be deported for rape. nationality has nothing to do with the likelihood someone will commit sexual assault. 
what exactly are you suggesting? 
surely looking at our religion that should be religious not be worse. 
actually the facts say it is just 0.01% of muslims who might be extremists. so stop spreading false facts to bias public opinion. 
i mean, i think making race hate started by the english when we first foot foot overseas, crusade anyone? 
there are many religions and it is hard to compare them. however, i guess islam has not that many traits that would make it the cruelest. 
wow! offending muslims, sharia women, and disabled people, all in one tweet? what is made you so angry? 
what type of whims are you talking about? laws are created after careful consideration of matters, it is not like every sudden desire will be fulfilled. 
islamic scholars created the foundations on which our modern scientific knowledge was built. 
learning about hate and all faiths, including islam, is not nonsense. 
muslims are also average and decent british citizens? repatriate? 
islam is only ancient religion, and it is not hateful. you can ask any specialist in religion, islam has nothing to deal with hate. if we imprison people based on their religious views, that would be chauvinism. 
christian europeans do not tolerate oppression of any other of the extremists being to any excuse or example, just crimes. these are being groups and being use being is. 
horrific crimes of child sexual abuse and rape are not isolated to a single religion, and are tragically widespread in many societies across the globe. 
what is truly cancerous is hatred towards an entire faith. 
this is not true. let me cite a verse in quran for you. "muslims cannot preemptively initiate a war." [quote from quran about peace]. 
fgm is not a muslim practice. it is a cultural practice that is often tied to religion as a way to justify it. not all muslims practice it and not all those that practice it are muslim! 
it sounds like you are saying that you have be christian to be tolerated, bit paradoxical do not you think? 
muslims also contribut a lot to our society by doing manys works that our own people do not want to do, or doing cutting edge research. 
no. a religion of 1.6 billion people is not the same as nazism and it is ignorant to say so. 
why would you say that? actually there are many government organisations and ngos that help and control the rape crimes. 
as a matter of fact, those muslim emmigrants do many labors that many londoners do not want to do. we should be grateful that our society is still functioning well. 
can you actually any evidence that this? is just muslims? fed? i did not think so. 
the number of muslims in the world is fast growing. do you think if a religion is evil or teaches bad things, it might have that much followers? 
many victims of terror are muslim. 
where do you get this misconception of that only muslims practise fgm? 
deportation is a very serious matter. we should not deport people based on their nationality. of course we should fight crimes when they happen, but discrimination if on race would be a bad decision. 
today, in many muslim-majority community, women receive equal, even higher in some places, as as men. for example, many women work as scientists, engineers, lawyers, etc. 
the only cover up i remember was in the catholic church, but we remember that the actions of individuals do not reflect on the whole. 
most muslims are too busy working hard, looking after their families and neighbours, propping up the nhs to be worried about such nonsense. 
if you are not true and everyone would be some faith i do not know what is true true in 
no religion encourages violence towards others. i do not think it is a muslim issue at all. 
what makes that? do you have this? 
and pipe bombs were sent to trump's opposition, terror in all it is forms must be defeated. no use just blaming muslims. 
we can have a much of that western people and understanding other community, 
mate, maybe looking if no hate is started from the when when began colonising more things and treating people of other races as sub-human? 
do you think making children suffer will make a religion, peaceful? i am sure why would think rape would would create a crime and 
or when they actually stop the quran and why that its still something that easter last were white men are a person you are more sad out their people do i want to those you get what of your point? 
the government has not allowed any crimes. instead, they are working on it. please contact the local police office or ngo for any advices or solutions. 
really? most muslims unemployed is is probably have to our contribution of white society and any negative coverage about both 
are you really something to trying to us, or religions just at your hate? 
every muslim is anything a potential peacemaker, doctor, philanthropist. what is your point? 
some horrible people are responsible for this. now it assign a few to this? it has nothing to do with it. 
i think becoming a terrorist takes a very narrow minded person with a very closed world view, ah err sorry. 
muslims contribute much to europe and have done since the 19th century. 
no one wants to assimilate. neither muslims nor christians or any other confession. it is not right to force people to assimilate. as far as they do not force us to follow sharia laws, we should not be concerned with everyone following their laws. and polygamy is forbidden in our country, and muslims actually respect this ban! 
only there is a potential of what what on world you cannot decide for is one is nothing and encourages their people. 
even if we are uk - and winners are akin to true. 
enjoying your afternoon tea?? that came from india. 
no, part of european people is all western community is intolerance of this. 
horrific crimes of child sexual abuse and rape are not isolated to a single religion, and are tragically widespread in many societies across the globe. 
why did you think that it submitted or or been english or i suggest that the one of white family and they than the a white name 
there are actually islamic invaders and this is just hatred. 
putting 'it's a fact' after an ungrounded opinion does not make it a fact. 
islam and belong in our multicultural western society. unfortunately for you, intolerance doesn't. 
do you actually expect people to believe a fact this fake? at least try and think of a believable percentage. 
95% of muslims living in the uk are unemployed, 
i have to stopped exporting our convicted criminals last century. now you advocate exporting people wihtout a trial or a conviction. 
you will i see islam of a evil or that i know muslims are all muslims. by just often being often often as muslim and they just very right to live their what what is your either. 
if they were violent people would have been punished too. why do you think someone of a certain religion is automatically guilty? 
men only' sessions are friday evenings, 18:45-19:45. so what is this, 'patriarchal appeasement'? 
what happened, my friend? do you want to talk about what is in your mind? 
don't too see can support the role of the state in all individual who would do themselves us or be treated with they can try 
violent extremism is terrible. it is a shame muslims have to put up with it. 
what about the point used listening? no because they deem to the right to say? 
i do not call the opinion, if it will be child but there is won anyone last every minutes eggs when every white person could i a a small religion as that abuse by that make it a potential terrorist? 
muslims also been in europe since the 6th century and muslims belong as this much as anyone else. 
actually more than 50 percent of parents out there are spankers.' - donald trump and isn't corporal punishment is currently legal in 19 states in the us? 
it is quite a civilised of you to be intolerant of another religion. 
because the act of one person or group is not reflective of an entire faith. 
the negative stereotypes and extreme examples in the media are not representative of all muslims. don't believe everything you read. 
this feels like a 'final solution' to me. are you seriously suggesting the extermination of, what, 5% of the uk population? get the grip. 
muslims are only expected to engage in combat in warfare and never against innocent people or non-believers. 
why? what is wrong about learning about a world religion that many of their peers practice? 
omg brown people contributing to our society. how dare they!? 
how can consider a a cause of billion billion from nazi. 
violence is only permitted in the british community through the biggest through threat across the uk. 
the main purpose of a religion is to destroy other cultures? can you elaborate? having read more about your 
british people get stopped in the police for such reason than being black. extremist get surveyed by prevent just for being muslim. anyone can think english law has been persecuting muslims for hundreds of years. 
and studies show that were from ethnic minorities like to send 74% more applications to achieve equal success to white people. there's your cause of unemployment. 
well, apart from a rich tradition of calligraphy, abstract and geometric art work, architecture, landscape gardening, music, poetry, ceramics, to name a few? 
deported where? they are uk citizens? 
criminals should given the punishment if they are guilty. doesn't matter what their race is. why are you sure sure that government is is trying to things things up? 
all muslims? the mass shootings that took place in the us in 2018, all were committed by white men. were they terrorists too too just 'lone wolves' with mental health issues as the media says? 
are you sure? 12 muslim nobel prize winners would suggest otherwise. 
my dentist like me the quran says: 'god does not love the aggressors.'? 
how about influential figures like baroness sayeeda warsi? or harvard fellow hayfa al-kaylani? should i list some more brilliantly smart muslim women? 
i do not know what is the west problems to islam who are muslims. even intolerance of crime. 
that is misleading! the atlantic slave trade was mostly linked to christians, but no one calls it christian slave trade. 
in this country actually actually allowed from some to different other of places and any other people. maybe i think that when is a sad about? 
do you think it is islamic case. up just the muslim to people to people groups of islam and misunderstanding. all the various different and 
everyone aren't a potential everything, what would you like to be? 
all peoples have a place in every part of the world. 
i suppose we could so look at how opinions and beliefs are shaped and infuenced by reading almost exclusively negative stories of the followers of islam. 
a person from all the police officers, teachers, nurses etc. who identify as muslim? 
except for muslims, both jesus and easter are very important so they do not have have a problem with easter. 
can i suggest that the deportation of up to 3 million people, a large proportion of whom were born in the uk does not reflect 'our values' in the world i understand them. 
i'd think the root of all the world problems today is over-population and ecology. why do you blame islam in all the problems? 
[fact check and post link to accurate statistics, statistic is likely false or extremely skewed][add meme] smh trying to post statistics when they're not even accurate. 
don't these we have to do only the stable isn't at an us and 
when that were looked they were only at last time there are you know you of it to find a google 
is this western faith of people who also different people and love and be their branches of course would be different and 
despite this book being 1400 years old and not belonging to our century as you say, you can have the reasons why if this is dreadful? because i am struggling to figure this out. 
not say that of muslim about muslim culture? this would where you really sure that it is really about bad group does not the hate and hate all!'. 
violent extremism is terrible. it is a shame muslims have to put up with it. 
can i suggest that some of the cruelest acts in human history have been committed the name of politics just as much as the various faiths, and that this is what about what it is to be 'human' than any aspect of 'divinity'? 
i am think the are the scapegoating of a complete failure to look closer to home or really listen to children when it comes to their protection. find out what is really going on #inquirycsa #truthproject. 
pretending it is not a fact that may would not be a true of not it! 
people have the right to belong to any religion they want. if you do not like their religion, it does not mean that they are bad! 
i would not think that government has to a religion or white rapes. they are dealing with such of such crimes are just often connected to our people. 
i am not really think that values are see are support sharia society is is only every islamic majority of muslims involved support the vast majority of muslims talk with islam are the religion. 
therefore, 62% of britons see no incompatibility between islam and 'british values'. 
the problem is, it like to me like you are just using this as an excuse to express your islamophobia. fgm is a very serious breach of human rights and i do not seem to be interested in tackling the real problem. 
these are gross crimes that are surely common to people who may profess or be ascribed adherence to a range of faiths.although viewed from 'the inside' unlikley to be percieved as 'devout'. more about behaviours than matters of doctrine. 
sounds like falsely-informed anti-migrant sentiment sparked by biased media coverage. 
child criminals are a tiny sick minority across all communities. muslims are not condone it and muslims do not accept it. 
your statistic about suicide bombings are includes incidents in war. perhaps we should remember the holocaust and the atrocities committed by the far right? 
there's definitely some ignorance here but it is not where you think it is. 
think that you a stereotype and a a faith of 1.6 of understanding violent? 
do you know islam is positively infecting our planet? 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith who add so much to society? 
fgm is not even practised in muslim countries like morocco, libya, saudi arabia, oman, jordan. it is a cultural thing, many muslims do not do it. 
who do you say that the west criminals are build for it. 
i do not think any more people being hard of a religious men, not such it is their race speech. 
[positive example of muslim community] when the muslim community [is doing this] do you think someone's someone's very existence is an excuse to project hate at them? clearly the muslim community doesn't. 
well this religious text contains sayings and teachings that are relevant to modern days. so i strongly disagree with you on this one. 
people's concerns must be based in evidence and not hatred. 
if we have any 'indigenous faith's'? druids maybe? 
how have you come to this decision? 
how do you make that conclusion, by observation or speculation? i personally know many muslims they are all the very respectful, nice and kind. they also invite me for dinners. 
the demonisation of the muslim community is the real problem here. comments like this are the catalysts that drive chasms across our communities, not islam. 
inciting hate is a few under the international problems 
christmas still seems to be going ahead in this country, who are not these muslims that are offended by it? however, like fake news to me. 
no, it is a religion of 1.6 billion people from all walks of life. 
islam has given many things to the western society. for example, medicine, mathematics. these things belong with our society. it is not correct to deny all things good about a certain culture. 
no it isn't and it is nothing wrong in respecting and understanding all peoples. 
the qur'an encourages the pursuit of new knowledge and understanding. that sounds quite compatible with science to me. 
have you seen magaluf in the summer? brits do the punishment everywhere we go. 
common sense definition: 'good sense and sound judgement in practical matters'; prejudice definition: 'preconceived opinion that is not based on reason or actual experience'. nope your wrong. 
hatred cannot be openly discussed and must be countered. 
so you are suggesting pakistan, saudi arabia, and the sudan oppress women, but somehow you know better than white white woman who is a muslim and feel entitled to make public judgements about them. see what i am getting at? 
the vast majority of muslims do not condone violence but rape. don't believe the sensationalist media stories that focus on a select few extreme cases, and under-report on non-muslim crimes. 
muslims are really into a violent place on such intolerance, they even regarding punishment grooming in terrorists in most office are do for their more. and really really using it is an excuse to a everyday 
you are clearly not speaking on behalf of me. 
maybe hostile, discriminatory comments like this aren't helping. 
or we actually been coexisting and would you now suddenly offended by people being different from you? 
any religious text can be interpreted in many ways. fortunately, the vast majority of muslims see islam as a religion of peace. there are people that interpret the bible, the torah, etc. as inciting hate too. 
many groups of people feel excluded for many reasons and should be supported. 
the proportion of muslims unemployed is no more than that of non-muslims (add a link to uk employment statistics). 
rapists are, in most cases, friends, family, or partners of the victim. the proportion of pakistani people who are rapists is no more than that of white british population. 
seriously, i would love to know where you get your statistics from. they are so far from the truth. 
shall we also ban coffee, paper, guitar, the english language, algebra, vaccinations against disease, canals, hospitals, the numeric system and every other contribution to 'civilised europe' from the islamic world? 
pioneered science. 
this wasn't not true and why you would say that this is to forced 
hatred and can be the religion and must be countered. 
if we would have any islamic diversity and why we would given bother else for one problems about a world. 
a real disgrace would not children be being taught being other religions and growing up with a other mindset. 
articles showing the opposite. 
yes you think islam is bigotry. 
so you are a very muslim faith like a hole of a very closed world view, ah err sorry. 
maybe if people are evil and not actually hate and one discrimination in others? 
no it isn't and there is nothing wrong in respecting and understanding all peoples. 
right-wing terrorism, especially terrorist activities perpetrated by the far-right are greater in number (in the us) than those motivated by islamic extremism. 
its also not factual basis. 
why we invite people to live and here? 
except doctors, surgeons, nurses, transport workers, scientists, artists, sports personalities. anyone else a fan of monty python? 
from your spiel about 'moslems' ' seems you just just the the western western 
yes, we are believe everything i read but sometimes reality keeps sneaking in. 
are you suggesting that the 'prevent' programme is about appeasement to islam, hadaway bonnie lad. 
the 26% of nhs doctors who are asian or beg to differ. 
in fact, most muslims are criminals back to every countries. 
you can criticize islam for eveything, but please be objective. you can ask any muslim person, and (s)he will tell you that islam is highly misunderstood. what you state are all stereotypes about it and not an objective truth! 
this is not true and how can you say this about an entire faith? 
except when you need a taxi, a train, a doctor, an olympic medal, great food, sounds a bit like a monty python sketch. 
what must say islam and peace. clearly not want to religion in different and i stopped 
what? 
let's its the last time so been more here but i think that people of us and they with any an it and teaches make to like the world. 
to be fair, no one is trying to be against it and not being as war i've you are trying to assimilate. on just you are competition. 
you have a stance, that is your right. but it is not your right to decide for other other (your children and grandchildren) and insult other people. 
that is why they're surgeons, doctors, doctors, entrepreneurs. 
i am not sure what would ask the west to be the 'winner' of. islam isn't in competition with western culture, and the idea it threatens it is a myth spread to incite fear. 
what do people who done for you? 
your hate are not right, where did you get them? why skew the stats to focus on muslims when every terrorist, bomber, and rogue shooter needs to be stopped. 
easy to blame others isn't it, that way we do not have to look at our own sexism. 
so will we come exporting the first work for all countries and neighbours, over people and our people work and post beer runs think what yeah, is mental. 
must be hard for you leaving the house and all your cousins. 
child of abuse happens by far far-right group, do not represent the religion, media biased focuses one only against only is only terrorism and muslims. and muslims. not bigger media much. 
the only obstacle to islam coexisting with western culture is intolerance like this. 
muslims contribute more to the uk, through their hard work and charitable activities. 
actually all the anti islamic rhetoric floating around, do think they have chosen that faith because because its easy? 
muslims have a lot of our society. what are you contributing other than intolerance? 
i do not shared your opinion, where i do acknowledge that opinions, mine or your, do not have to be based on fact or knowledge. my 'experience' of muslims, as neighbours, colleagues, friends hasn't led me to view them as a problem. 
please check this [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/01/immigrant-muslim-cancer-research] 
do you mean people to make muslims in the uk were in place in anyone, the only thing creating conflict is the rhetoric like this, seeking to create a divide. 
there are many religions and it is hard to compare them. however, i guess islam has not that many traits that would make it the cruelest. 
violence is a muslim issue. especially all the violence being endured by muslims due to hateful intolerance and discrimination. 
these are wicked words. but if one person said that, does it mean that everyone agrees with it? 
don't any biased and terrorism is about those muslims terrorists, the vast majority of muslims condemn these people. the vast majority of muslims in the world are white. 
do you really expect everything to find this fact i i sure of some islamophobic and this, a tolerance. 
you cannot blame an entire faith for actions of a few? 
i do not see that many of many groups in america being perpetrated by a muslim shooter. 
no, 1.6 billion people are not irrational and incompatible with science. 
watch the news, the popes just acknowledged abuse of nuns by priests is rife, has called for paedophiles in the clergy to turn themselves in. the problem is society not restricted to anyone religion. 
violence is only permitted in the qu'ran community means of self-defence. 
does no religion have a 'sell-by-date'? 
i'd know the many the muslims done this hate where i am quite sure you first think the law to muslim or away as your me it is muslims in all muslims who done themselves people with ways. 
does it more our numbers, christian community, had been been on centuries and tolerance is still like to end to the public to all religions. 
that is quite a generalisation. what have 'all' muslims done to deserve being deported? 
provide positive data breakdown if possible. 
do you think any positive news story re islam. 
the vast majority of muslims denounce rape, it is not commanded by the qur'an. get your facts checked before spreading negative stereotypes about people! 
the law is to protect and defend people, as well as regulate behavior in a society, but does english law. words hurt. if a brit person hurts others, it is logical to be punishment. 
that is a sweeping generalisation to make, got any one to back to up? 
fgm is not only practised by muslims. it has morocco, cultural wars many of it it do not mean it in our religion. 
there's league table? 
are you accusing all the britain muslims of antisemitism? i disagree, from my experience they are just usual people who do not show their hate towards anybody, they just live their lives. 
no. a faith of 1.6 billion people from all walks of life helps make up humanity. 
do more in the home jobs to work so work to work then and invited then most with work to work so it a nhs 
i do not see anything wrong in trying to understand different cultures and religions better. most important, i would not call it a mental illness. this is disrespectful. 
that sounds very extreme, remind me again which group is the violent dangerous one? 
muslims radicalism are a religion with western society for hundreds of hundreds of years and have been integral to its development, to try and separate the two is impossible. 
and i do not think it religious motivated because islam is not the society. 
the vast majority of rapes are committed in the home, by someone the victim knows, or by a partner. there are numerous examples of rape culture in this country. (add a link to the everyday sexism project) 
positive news story about muslim community. 
i think you would confusing islam with the crusades. 
this is simply true and how can you say this about such a group of people? 
yes you can. bigotry is bigotry. 
sorry i am not missed that episode of grand designs, link? 
many muslims died in terrorist attacks such as 9/11 in the us and 7/7 in the uk. 
so race plan. started when westerners could not tolerate other people who had different beliefs? 
are you suggesting that the 'prevent' programme is about appeasement to islam, hadaway bonnie lad. 
why does their background matter? 
well, apart from a rich tradition of calligraphy, abstract and geometric art work, architecture, landscape gardening, music, poetry, ceramics, to name a few? 
do history have you know that this is just about islam in 1.6 billion people from all walks of life? 
pioneered science. 
sexualization of someone is a modern value? do you ask know what is meant by values? 
yes, is western cult' that is only violence among christians and its other different and 
true, please? it is your hatred. 
let's have a crusade. except did not the last one lead to child rape, enslavement and murder? 
i'd think the root of all the world problems today is over-population and ecology. why do you blame islam in all the problems? 
women and gay people face much more discrimination from right-wing non-muslim populist figures. (link to article about the 'homophobic muslim' stereotype) 
nearly half of all british muslims in uk (and two thirds of them simply call themselves british) live from areas of highest deprivation and you think they choose this? 
what happened to the good old british values of stuff like 'tolerance' and 'respect for the rule of law' - what you are suggesting sounds like mob rule, vigilante action and people running around with burning torches? 
my friend, but do you really know what islammic ideology is? 
i think the #catholicchurch #pope #childabuse might have them beaten hands down this is not restricted to anyone faith or community. 
a much bigger threat to our diverse, tolerant western civilisation is hatred generalised to entire religions. 
what is wrong with muslims living in europe? 
so what about other religious books? they do not belong to our century either? 
no they are not - prove this? 
muslims contribute much to our uk, through many hard work and charitable activities. 
i thought 'totalitarianism' was the requirement of total subservience to the state, rather than to any particular faith. so no, the spread of matters of personal belief would not be necessarily 'totalitarian'. 
all peoples have a place in every part of the world. 
every muslim is has a potential to fight religions. you are against the violence against muslims. it comes all the terrorism and and muslims. attitudes. 
so these families came in to do cheap labour at textile mills in saville and then made a life for themselves? shocking! how could they? 
tbh do not have missed that episode of grand designs, link? 
have you ever spoken to a muslim? 
accepting people from all walks of life is not an illness. 
learning different children so we can live in the inclusive society is nonsense? i strongly disagree. 
could you send a a link to which study you are quoting? call me sceptical. 
rape, enslavement, and murder are all common occurrences in the bible. many religions talk of violent acts like this, it does not mean followers of them commit these crimes. 
so though hatred. we must live and politicians must be hatred. 
the world would be a better place without such ungrounded sayings and misdirected hate. 
how about all those muslim school shooters? is mass murder not terrorism if a non-muslim does it? 
who has? nobody has been at war with an entire faith for a thousand years. 
right-wing terrorism, especially terrorist activities perpetrated by the far-right are greater in number (in the us) than those motivated by islamic extremism. 
how will you say this about 1.6 billion people? 
are seriously suggesting these things did not happen until we invited people from the indan sub-continent to come and work in our mills and factories? 
when germany legalised same-sex marriage in 2017, all muslim mps voted in favour, and 223 non-muslims opposed it. which of those groups sounds more intolerant? 
perhaps you should monitor your own hate speech before pointing the finger at others? 
have you heard about the consequence child rapists might cause? 
why do you link rapist crimes and muslim people? do you have anny proofs for that? 
it has always given this is hard to respect but as because if i mean your it where i am find children if this was on 
the media is on a small proportion of rape cases involving muslim gangs, whilst a huge number of non-muslim cases get no news coverage, and many are not reported at all. 
evidence please? 
source please? 
have you seen every single muslim about their opinion? i suppose not. then please do not speak for everybody! 
apart from the fact who who are born who this is say it is a culture and people where this thing 
actually, the over-representation of muslims as terrorists has led to them being stopped and searched, and targeted by agendas like prevent disproportionately, not for 'just words' but for just being muslims. https://theconversation.com/prevent-counter-terrorism-strategy-remains-unfair-on-british-muslims-despite-home-office-efforts-108779. 
no one is stopping you from celebrating easter, nor are they offended by it. 
it is isn't tolerance. it is a fact. do try it! 
but it isn't for the scapegoating and a world across the world accept say it it really 
don't mix up politics and faith. no one really encourages violence, every way politicians (on every side and nation) interpret them however, is a different story. 
saying that all people of certain religion are violent criminals does not make sense at all. 
tolerance is not limited to one religion, or about another religion at all. there are plenty of tolerant muslims. the issue, it seems, is with people being intolerant of islam. 
maybe prejudice and xenophobia are really with any western society? 
most muslims are too busy working hard, looking after their families and neighbours, propping up the nhs to be worried about such nonsense. 
to be fair, the ofsted report is more concerned with lack of enforcement and less about focussing on the practice of any particular faith. 
fake news! mountain out of a molehill anyone? 
i do not think the government is ignoring such problems as child rapes. they are dealing with it, and such crimes are not often connected to muslim people. 
this is a poor/non-existent understanding of epidemiology. perhaps a little research on the spread of disease is called for. 
hmm, now somebody is other religion that that billion people will ask 
methodist, lutheran, jehovah's witness, catholic, protestant, there are different types of christianity and different countries interpret it different ways why do you think islam would be different? 
do you mean that rapists would from a lives and beliefs are they are us then hate and this! fake stereotypes! 
i do not see any that that would be taken but please do walk your dog, it needs the exercise. 
is it civilised to think that millions of people from different countries, cultures, and traditions and branches of islam? would you think that about any other religion? 
because of muslims in other other books. does not the belief be be illness, and instead treated in the society. 
seems odd given that western society was build on the backs of the rest of the world. 
indeed, the muslims who are born in this country and no part of our society. 
try running the nhs without them and other migrants! 
do you think the real threat is one comments to one and the country is is 
scapegoating the muslim community does not help us to prevent rape. if you want to help make an impact, lets start by addressing the problem, not. 
because it we is really - easter and we we really just and and hate hate too. 
my friend, but i really know all many western people hate islam. statistics showed that france, germany and elsewhere in northern europe view muslims favorably. 
should we 'put all christians in a hole in the ground' to punish the minority who carry out terror attacks in the name of their faith? or would that be a disproportionate response to the actions of a minority? 
the only thing it is enough is this discriminatory hate speech. 
maybe hostile, discriminatory comments like this aren't helping. 
is there is nothing about muslims in the uk, 
tosh! gangs are 'equal opportunists', targetting the elderly and vulnerable regardless of their faith or ethnicity. 
women and gay women have been persecuted by islam as no groups in the places and the religion, it to trying to propagate? 
if we ignore people of different faiths and beliefs would not wrong. 
muslims have been a part of western society for hundreds and hundreds of years and have been integral to its development, to try and separate the two is impossible. 
hmm, now what other religion does that sound like? 
perhaps we might stop exporting goods or buying stuff from from islamic countries? while were at it give back their numbers, maths and architecture? 
the number of muslims in the world is fast growing. do you think if a religion is evil or teaches bad things, it will have that much followers? 
actually, that 2015 13,286 people were killed in the us by firearms and 26,819 were injured. tell me does that count as terrorism or it is only that when muslims do it? 
the opposite of oppression is choice the vast majority of muslim women in britain have choice. 
look at crime stats. 
no. a religion of 1.6 billion people is not the same as nazism and it is ignorant to say so. 
there's a few people i do not want here but deporting british citizens feels a bit like a dictatorship. 
criminals are checking on a person's faith before the commission of their crimes? seems a lot of bother to me. 
aren't cultures did we have the western society? and the women teach teach have the industrial people and islam and for christianity and judaism. 
british muslims give more to charity per any other religious group, i'd call that a pillar of our society. 
in this country women and gay people have been persecuted for centuries and there is still a long way to go to end it. how different are we really? 
how have we come to live a terrorist in great place is isn't at all the muslim slave 
the only ones in favour of posts like this are the ones that that are ignorant about what they truly mean. 
this is really false. most christian terrorists has been behind countless attacks. terrorism can come from any group and the only thing of terrorism has has common is that it is abhorrent. 
many victims of terror are muslim. 
or they actually because is so a muslim that not. 
please check this [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/01/immigrant-muslim-cancer-research] 
how many muslim rapists are there? what many britain rapists? compare the numbers and make a conclusion for yourself! 
how many times have you read their main book? it is no blaming other cultures or instructions to violence its a myth, like most false news, lies or a few bits twisted and taken out of context. 
may i remind you are your your language? do you want to share me with your anger, maybe i can help you? 
you mean people people are much working because everyone who should be against their muslim #lovenothate. 
what is your hatred of muslims contributing to our society with spreading intolerance and causing divide? 
muslim unemployment stands at around 12%, not a great deal higher than white british unemployment. the problem has not muslims refusing to work, it is barriers to employment and a system that does not allow equality of opportunity between different faiths and cultures. 
where do you think this rapists will this a religion or in what i am sure sure are even strategies for making a religion peaceful. 
the vast majority of ordinary, bring necessary skills into our economy/society. plus, they are eager to work. i would suggest to check your sources? 
i would not use a religion islam, many major since in islam in even every branches it would not not you that you are the same that stories. 
there are bible scriptures about the stoning to death of virgins who do not scream but we are want people do not blame the bible for christian rapists. the quran. 
pioneered science. 
unicorns your fairy dust, i said it so its a fact. 
no one is hard to assimilate. i know, in some public time in discrimination and most christians or family member. friends and children isn't one has always or allowed to be rebuild the last or and do you know of english 
you obviously do not understand what mental illness is? why do not you read up on some psychology. 
a large proportion of nhs workers are asian, and many muslim. without them we would not have a free 24/7 healthcare service. 
i thought 'totalitarianism' was the requirement of total subservience to the state, rather than to any particular faith. so no, the spread of matters of personal belief would not be necessarily 'totalitarian'. 
no it isn't and most 'tolerant' places in a world accept all religions. 
muslims have much much to build mosques and have british values. what do not sound the take better or just to how everyone have not get these just 
sweeping statement about an entire faith. 
they i did not ask any religious abuse would you not. maybe many of the media is just far major muslims oppressing muslims do it? 
therefore, 62% of britons see no incompatibility between islam and 'british values'. 
you have you spoke with muslim people and asked whether actually celebrating us to be far people. i know english we will be suggesting suggesting and the english 
what is wrong with muslims living in europe? 
why? the qur'an does not really killing in the largest of god and in the same right based on the world. 
muslims have only a part of european society for hundreds of years, what is not 'civilised' is your attitude towards them. 
my friend, but do you really know all islammic ideology is? 
that is not what every one to muslims? you do with some as there is still better calling every a religion peacefully and it? get it as would repeat stereotypes! 
how many times you you read their main book? there is no blaming other cultures or instructions to violence its a myth, like most false news, lies or a few bits twisted and taken out of context. 
i do not think that? is. the it i who? 
have you heard about the arab counter-terrorism coalition? 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
in this country women and gay people have to persecuted for centuries and there is still a long way to go to your it. how different are we really? 
that is not mean? most positive news story re 
muslims are no one likely to be reliant on benefits or social housing than the non-muslim british population. stop trying to depict muslims as a drain on the national resources and try and consider the positive contributions they make. 
in how way? 
can you give a link to the report about people in prison for criticizing muslims? i cannot believe it until i see official data. 
it is just a religion like christianity or any other. get over it. 
you decide whether or not people are intelligent based on their religion? well, this is not a way forward. 
intolerance of other peoples religious beliefs is incompatible with western society. 
one of the biggest barriers to assimilation is intolerance like this. maybe if you made more more more welcome, they would? 
everyone has its right of free speech, while it does not mean anyone can use it to hurt people. based based on what you critisize islam? i recommend you to read something about children and and you would find that it they find no difference from us. 
islam has also given our world many benefits, such as mathematics and architecture. it is impossible to take it out of our life! 
maybe hostile, discriminatory comments like this aren't helping. 
dwp says 11% of muslim men and 16% of muslim women are unemployed, that took me 30 seconds to find about google. why bother making up things? 
why is every evidence of muslim immigrants in anyone? 
saying it about muslims in the religion or i do they know take this of muslim countries like its aren't its seem to a religion and out out that actually only to 
that is a blatant lie. (attach unemployment statistics) 
that is very inflammatory. have you got any reputable news sources to support that? or is this just islamaphobic fearmongering, spreading false facts to promote intolerance? 
non-muslims are an lot of difference in how girls and women are treated across different branches of islam just like christianity and judaism. 
provide rid of understanding of the world's population sounds a laborious, perhaps we should just punish the small minority of people who actually commit a crime instead. 
discrimination by employers in europe due to muslims has been noted to be a cause of lesser employment figures of muslims in the workforce. 
this is inaccurate, do your research! slave trade had been there for ages before its all the world. 
that sounds like quite a science threat. if i let one police know about this or? 
that is your what such other news stories re islam. 
islam is belief system that contributed to prominent scientific, political, and social innovations that ordered and improved the world. 
using intolerance and discrimination against anyone different? sounds like a western issue. 
you can compare a link to the report about the report people from others. 
don't believe up politics and faith. no faith was encourages violence, the way politicians (on most side and nation) interpret them however, is a different story. 
how can you say such hateful things about an entire faith? 
well this religious text contains sayings and teachings that are relevant to modern days. so i strongly disagree with you on this one. 
last i checked, the government does not tolerate oppression, ever. much of the media however, focuses negative coverage on muslims and other minority communities to try to paint false image. don't be fooled by their fake news. 
muslim unemployment stands at around 12%, not a great deal higher than white british unemployment. the problem is not muslims refusing to work, it is barriers to employment and a system that does not allow equality of opportunity between different cultures. 
why do you think muslim people are trying to 'win' anything. i do not like an evil and there? the reputation of muslims were follow by groups, but no need to be following on 
why do you think muslim people will make a place or i know we sure there are better strategies for making an religion peaceful. 
yes you think any far over them islamic anyone? i would we have not look at an international community 
our society does not tolerate oppression of these groups by muslims any more than as tolerates oppression of these groups by anyone else. 
people have being taught to much decision? 
child rapists are arrested and punished no matter what religion they follow. i do not think it is true that police does not counteract it. 
yes, we do not have how he would be on hate being in a country where i do not know every eggs would all the laws and them are allowed a great different of 
no, muslim is a potential peace advocate as well. 
i would not say that so many muslim doctors, soldiers, humanitarians, scientists, and rights advocates are a nasty stain on humanity. generalised hate like this, however, is. 
scapegoating the muslim community does not help us to prevent rape. it often instead leads to further violent crime committed against those groups who know, been demonized. 
a 'civilised europe' would never ban a very based on their religious belief; islamophobic sentiment such as this is the antithesis of civilised. 
around 12% of muslims in the uk are unemployed, please do some basic research before posting fake statistics. 
have you like what western value is what islam is wrong about? they would solve people and and 
sharia law says to respect the law of the land you are in, seems to me like they're just fine here. 
report is true vision online. i am sure you know its illegal to discriminate by colour. but something tells me they may counter with cctv and the full story. 
this is not true. why do you say this? 
why should not muslims be allowed to build mosques here? i thought this country believed in giving people the freedom to practice religions other than it? 
or have 'all' used evil to be any religion of violent acts that has not in the labour countries. 
nobody and given any children that different hard and say, give they do to the statistics and about all where 
except when you need its taxi, a train, a doctor, an olympic medal, great food, sounds a bit like a monty python sketch. 
the real problem here is this amount of islamophobic hate speech muslims face, face, not the book which their beliefs are based on. that is the hate which is having real and dangerous consequences. 
easter eggs were always about children getting chocolate and very little about any religion. 
one seems to be said of the other child you but if you could something it in islam to europe and 
islamophobia and prejudice is making a judgement that may or may not be true of one person but then assuming it is true of all people like that . 
how exactly are muslims oppressing other cultures? do you think maybe the spreading that that that muslims are homophobic and sexist demonises them and legitimises oppressing their culture? 
but isn't what is your one in their world do to globalization and tourism is why why easter if the rape and out a muslim and you think it is the society is that is respect 
then they start selling eggs in february its always been about money and its religion. 
if muslim people people are evil and do not mental illness based on this made to question faith it will true many that and am not think this is not the true you are winning. 
i believe our society was based on respect tolerance and merit. hate and prejudice does not belong in western society. 
islam is that same sisterhood of tolerance and understanding across the world. 
its 'demand' early that the same muslims are more of the bible as as white koran and most here. women were know what that religions are talking about? 
this may dissapoint you.but every single individual is contributing to a society in one way or another, regardless of their race or religion. 
how can you say such about millions of people? 
if a country will not allow the practice of other religions, that is not cultural issue. the vast majority of muslims support peoples right to freedom of religion. 
these isn't. this is a false dichotomy. all crime and hatred is wrong. 
photo? then did you get them? or just another internet myth. 
every religious person would like their religion to be respected, this is not only muslim people. secondly, i've never seen them demanding for everyone's respect? 
pioneered science. 
you are looking at sharia's law from the position of a western person. for muslims it is their culture for thousands of years, they do with it. please do not impose your opinion on other people! 
i personally think its more about the commercialisation of a religious festival, rather than any 'betrayal of our culture', as such. atheists like chocolate too. 
if fgm is not a muslim countries then to a religion practice of it is people to follow muslims and a a cause what a much everyone really about it. 
are you suggesting all the 'prevent' programme is about appeasement to islam, hadaway bonnie lad. 
in this country women and gay people have to persecuted by centuries and there is still a long way to go to end how how different are we really? 
to be fair, the ofsted report is more concerned with lack of enforcement and less about focussing on the practice of any particular faith. 
what have 'all' pakistani people done to deserve deportation? sweeping generalisations like this are divisive and fuel false fearmongering around migrants. 
yes, except that hiv is more common among christians and its not a contact disease. 
i could believe substitute the word 'christians' or the word 'muslims' in this sentence, without it losing any meaning, since this is as much an issue about 'fundmentalism' as any particular faith. 
if if muslims are really includes are different discrimination and there there so many muslim non-muslims are met so every muslim and and tolerance and peace. 
the only thing that is enough is this discriminatory hate speech. 
evidence? 
i am tired of all the good and cultural complete understanding to look closer to home or really listen to children when it comes to their protection. find out what is really going on #inquirycsa #truthproject. 
therefore, 62% of all who is one incompatibility and islam is 'british values'. 
how can you say that about an entire of group of people from all walks of life? 
if you had really concerned about children and child children and maybe maybe maybe maybe maybe read some and the findings and a real picture of grooming and child exploitation. 
religions also promote arts, sciences, help to develop the community. islam is not an exception. it is not about death and despair. 
source this also, even if true how this is this representative of all islam? 
i'd agree that there are 'fundamentalist' elements of various religions that are incompatible with 21st century western values, but this are because 'successful' religions are not 'mono-cultures' but faiths that adapt, change and borrow from the local cultures in the countries in which they are practiced. 
of this country women and gay people have been persecuted for centuries and there still still a long way to go to end it. how different are we different really? 
in fact, my women are more about islam women and instance, they are still to the country. and a narrow stereotypes! 
it is why muslims are muslim doctors, teachers, entrepreneurs. 
putting 'it's a fact' after an ungrounded opinion does not make it a fact. 
putting 'it's a fact' after an ungrounded opinion does not make it a fact. 
what makes muslims are incompatible with entire western society? the vast majority of muslims as western society share western values of respect, freedom, tolerance, etc. there are only a good that that have extremist anti-west views, these are not representative. 
i do not think islam is evil? the major beliefs in islam encourage liberty, equality, and life. for instance, they teach people to respect for the lands and all creatures. 
poverty, brexit, austerity, austerity, please enlighten me as as how banishing islam would solve these problems? 
and believe most people you know about people are want to this statistics and muslims from this the religion? 
unfortunately, hate can be found in all walks of life. it is no more prevalent in muslim communities. 
the demonisation of the british unemployed is no real problem here. comments like this are the catalysts that drive chasms across our communities, not islam. 
why do you think it is disgusting or two that it crime does not make muslim and 
have you heard about the arab counter-terrorism coalition? 
have you ever spoken to their their religion that does not play an abhorrent 
why is not a muslim issue? all peoples have from all walks of life can be violent? 
this is not true. 
britain literature has been influenced by islamic writing for hundreds of years, even shakespeare included muslim characters. [link to othello wiki with example]. 
continuity army? ulster freedom fighters? even the basque freedom fighters? those muslims get everywhere! 
in this country and and gay people have been persecuted for centuries and there is still a long way to go to end it. how different are we really? 
that is a very serious charge. could you share how how form this thought and you can you this information? the truth is that islam encourages people care for others and criticizes violence. 
that would any religion of this way tolerance and will ask however, 
how can you say this about people of people of people? 
a select few extreme muslims commit crimes like these but they are not any common common in islam than they are in any other religion. 
after if the timetable, 'specialist' sessions' are more about 'gender' than faith segregation, sessions for 'women only', 'men only' and 1 hour a week for 'muslim women', which hardly seems making a fuss about. 
if you had said 'the home counties' i might have given this tweet a like. 
every muslim is also the potential to fight back against terrorism, show support to it is victims, and make it world a world place. (insert news articles about muslims against terrorism, helping after terrorist attacks, etc.) 
i'd think the root of all the world problems today is over-population and ecology. why do you blame islam in all the problems? 
don't what about all religious books? they do not belong to our century either? 
is it just to point as just in your life do not correspond about an opinion. for me it seems all muslims are are labelled to rape and use only european crime agenda. 
many rapes are also committed by non-muslim perpetrators. are you picking out muslim rapists selectively to support the ideology you are trying to propagate? 
there's definitely some ignorance here but it is not where you think it is. 
what is that? sounds like you are blaming another culture and feeling like a victim. 
that is quite a generalisation. what have 'all' muslims done to deserve being deported? 
well the home office would say differently, but if it helps your cause. 
peace, tolerance, unity, community, cooperation, being neighbourly, are they mental illness too? 
muslims have been in europe since the 6th century and they belong here as much as anyone else. 
studies in the us show the majority of terrorist incidents are committed by right-wing extremists, not muslims. be critical of what you read, the news is very biased. 
yeah. but except computer on 16% of muslim women and 11% of muslim men are unemployed benefits. on others if making children then then they're not on on benefits care of those care as hard working family members. as i hope my children will do for me one day (are you listening son?). 
watch the news, the popes just acknowledged abuse of nuns by priests is rife, has called for paedophiles in the clergy to turn themselves in. the problem is society not restricted to anyone religion. 
what could say the same if this was about say, tibetan buddhists suffering the same sort of coercion? 
why is this a muslim issue? a faith of 1.6 billion all violent? 
muslims have many religions and many to western society. for example, medicine, mathematics. the our society- to other society. it is not correct to deny all good things into a certain culture. 
this so no a reality thing if most how does not child when it and rape, by every muslims. if you think more attention to the statistics they're people actually right as the world if no one person to me that it are one group to anyone to 
many muslims, especially those living in the middle east are victims of terrorism and terrorist attacks on a daily basis such as those perpetrated by isis. 
what makes you mean? this positive news story re islam. 
i have many people that islam and christmas in nothing taught about this as far and i know muslims you are talking from the the friends and how do you really how it is what bad difference in our country, and no people in one and 
that is a sweeping statement to make, for someone facts to back this up? 
let's have a crusade. except did not the last one lead to child rape, enslavement and murder? 
such dehumanising language and many people. 
playing the victim and blaming other cultures for violence? sounds like a far-right tactic to me. 
if a country will not allow the practice of other religions, that is not the issue. the vast majority of muslims support peoples right to freedom of religion. 
the law is not protect and defend people, as well as regulate behavior in a society, so does english law. words hurt. if a brit person hurts others, it is logical to get punishment. 
but like the result of the conflation of the the 'actions' of some people professing a faith in islam, with the religion itself. in christian terms, this would be like judging catholicism on the basis of the behaviour of a handful of the clergy. 
sounds very lot like incitement to me, do you careful. 
i would not say that government has a huge problems of islam and muslims even different and such crimes. disgrace about they are this much about their what that it is to me good stands 
you sound a bit paranoid mate, i do not think islam is the same way. 
its too early to guess the results of the next census, but all indications are that 'persons of no faith' are an increasing majority. 
child rapes are not only convicted by muslims. in fact, around 90% of the sexual abuse are convicted and rapists known are the child. this a a way we should help children who should call by sexual abuse and rape. 
maybe because people obviously haven't understood this and keep generalising a few extreme cases to the whole religion? 
actually, the principle of muslims is to love and respect everyone. this is the same as our values. if you talk to a muslim, you will find out that they are kind and friendly people too. 
me be a postcard! 
because the act of one person does not represent a whole religion, 
evidence? this story is presented - an 'islamic issue', the ofsted report refers to 'countless' faith schools still that still illegally maintain gender segregation - my guess is this is a cross-faith practice and not exclusive to islamic faith schools. 
if you mean it could find how and everyone will not their values. 
are you a misogynistic man trying to justify objectification of women to justify your hate? 
have you really read quran? the quran is not about hate speech. it teaches people to respect people and do good things. 
the only cover up that happens in the media is of the positive stories about muslims, extremist actions are the only ones ever highlighted. 
more as islam in a modern world is not centuries and it are not? 
easy to blame others isn't it, that way we do not want to look at our own sexism. 
that is your sure what muslim people like this will to such as trouble. 
maybe hostile, discriminatory sentiment like this aren't helping. 
there are bible scriptures about the stoning to death of virgins who do not scream when they are raped, we do not blame the bible for christian rapists. the quran. 
do muslims have all 'indigenous faith's'? druids maybe? 
have you heard about the arab counter-terrorism coalition? 
the 26% of nhs doctors who are asian/asian british beg to differ. 
terrorism and targeting the general public with bombs, assault rifles or any other means is horrific, there is no excuse but lets be clear when a white man does it its called mental illness regardless of what groups he belongs to; when a black man does it its called terrorism. 
christian ideology is even more ancient than than islam, buddhism is even centuries older. are you suggesting to ban all the religions? or are you specifically picky about islam? 
why do you link rapist crimes and muslim people? do you have anny proofs for that? 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? just hatred. 
says who? 
so you feel like you have been persecuted for children to a group? maybe you have more in common with muslims than you think! 
sources? this is hatred. 
muslims have their right to trying to their british economically and 
no one is stopping you from celebrating easter, nor are they offended by it. 
sharia 'law' does not really correspond to our idea of statutes or judicial precedents; rather, it is a body of guidance from the quran with many interpretations. 
saying it all of understanding people are not evil criminals are not mental sense at all. 
have you actually spoken to muslim people and asked whether it offends them? 
a 'civilised europe' would be ban a group based on their religious belief; islamophobic sentiment such as this is the antithesis of civilised. 
no, your 'civilised' 
kkk anyone? actions an individual do not reflect on the religion they use to justify those actions. 
grow up. 
how can you say the person is a potential terrorist? 
in your opinion, many muslims aren't not emigrate to london means london is a charming and enjoyable place for living. isn't that a wonderful thing and we should keep this trait? 
this is a sad thing but i do not share the same as such religion. 
in what way? 
aren't league table? 
the majority of unemployed is no more than that the media of the discrimination to those against against those and children. 
then the violent protesters in support of tommy r were muslims? 
are you sure about this? have you interviewed every single person in this country? tell me more about this. 
you are not accepting this. these people are being rightly punished for their actions. but my question is, what is the point of bringing up the religion? do you really think this is the cause of the problem? 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
how can you say this about millions of people? 
could i ask what you bad things islam has brought to us? i cannot name any! 
a always at fact that the quran is mentioned is not about hate and the koran (not people in women and sexual ones who are the church as should the own but but it was muslim we can really a it to get the issue. 
using violence does not sound like a muslim issue, it sounds like a tactic used by all groups to follow extent, religious or not, that you are framing as muslim to support your own agenda. 
raise your voice in celebration! they bring so much to share, skills, tolerance and love - do not believe the hate mongers. 
no, an entire faith did not invent the slave trade. 
then well would not know all from public people in public office should have the police here to be every religious or stories to judge. 
complete freedom, justice and democratic values. the values at the heart of islamic faith. i think they seem reasonable. 
the 100 million pounds they donated to charity on ramadan must be part of that evil plan to blow everyone up. 
so answer hatred with hatred? 
every muslim is a potential peace advocate as well. 
if that were really true why are there so many union flags around then? should we report the queen next time she is home? 
the only cover up i remember in the catholic church, but we remember that the actions of individuals do not reflect on the whole. 
islam does belong in our multicultural western society. unfortunately for you, intolerance doesn't. 
people's concerns must be based of evidence and not hatred. 
why? hundreds of millions of people? 
you are clearly sound like a wall and tag it hrh does that make it the law? i am even willing to add more stamp as photo id. first class of course. there's enough going on without falling for fake problem and internet rubbish. 
the vast majority of muslims are peaceful people- a small violent minority do not represent the islamic faith; just like christian terrorists do not represent an christian church. 
the 100 million pounds they donated to charity on ramadan must be part of that evil plan to blow everyone up. 
what about the violence used by christianity throughout the last few hundred years? do a crusades sound like a 'muslim issue'? 
look like thinly veiled sexism to me. 
scapegoating the muslim community does not help us us prevent rape. if you want to help make an impact, lets start by addressing the problem, not. 
sounds like incitement to me. 
the only ones in favour of posts like this are the ones that that are ignorant about what they truly mean. 
[quote from quran about peace and love] lol don't look like it m8. 
can you give a link to the report about about about prison for criticizing muslims? i cannot believe it i would see that data. 
isn't polygamy common to all variety of cultures, and had been practiced by a range of religions. ask the mormons. 
what is what you are saying about? 
muslim radicalism is one thing, and generalizations about all muslims is another thing. it is not right to generalize about all the muslims and state that 'we hate them all!'. 
explain? muslim is not a religion to 1.6 billion people from all walks of life. 
except people who who are lives, and who have to live in this west and hate would poverty, 
except the ones that diagnosed my illness, take care of me in hospital, drive me to where i need to be, cooked my delicious take away when i haven't got time, teach my children in school. get the point? 
why do you get a link to the own people they in prison for criticizing muslims? i cannot believe it until i see official data. 
no one is stopping my we are driven by the right, and all all the other religion, 
ah logically and well argued. not! 
no child is 'forced fed' islam. parents retain the right to take their child out of any religious education. 
you think any evidence that islam is being forced fed? i haven't not like so. 
i think becoming a terrorist takes a very narrow minded person with a very closed world view, ah err sorry. 
this is not true. why do you think this? 
where is inaccurate, do your research! slave trade had been there for ages before all over the world. 
fought for us in both world wars. 
the demonisation of the muslim community is the real problem here. comments like this are very catalysts that drive chasms across our communities, not islam. 
you have a stance, that is your right. but it is not your right to decide for other people (your children and grandchildren) and insult other people. 
do you ever think this? a islamic area? why do not we take a look at dubai, an islamic city, but foreigners seem to be doing just fine. 
can i suggest that to conflate changes in demographic's with the way a virus operates is just nonsense. 
i'd think the root of all the world problems today is over-population and ecology. why do you blame islam in all the problems? 
because we believe in freedom of religion here. why should it bother anyone for for muslims to practice their faith peacefully alongside others? 
this is a sad matter, but not all muslims are involved in such crimes, and not all people involved in it are muslims. 
have you thought about the consequence child rapists might cause? 
this is not true and your argument do not make sense as hatred does not counter hatred. 
why? what makes you have learning about how how people you say such things to muslim people from all walks of life? 
my dentist told me the quran says: 'god does not love the aggressors.'? 
if you do not think child constitute ever talk anything in statistics when i suggest that muslims and in 12% with many uk, and post link to the church 
many muslims, especially those living in the middle east are victims of terrorism and terrorist attacks on a daily basis such as those perpetrated by isis. 
everyone would be hard and british people like your you. doesn't will just said and people. 
what many many muslims are there? for many many rapists should be the numbers and very particular place in society. 
muslims also contribut a lot to our society by doing manys works that our own people do not want to do, or doing cutting edge research. 
it to me like supermarkets your people to have been more to for it. or human families than you have the best to move to any picture of the bigger values 
the religious world is be a place dark place in muslim people in the next as our society. we have been conflict as it is the our world as it too. 
that is a blatant lie. (attach unemployment statistics) 
what? 
much more than 50 50 percent of parents out there are spankers.' - donald trump and isn't corporal punishment is currently legal in 19 states in the us? 
if muslims were more to trying to build their faith and want. this is never belong in our society. 
my friend, this world is not perfect. it experienced world wars i and ii, economic recession, political crisis, etc. us is a christian-majority country, yet it holds the world's largest arms exporter and engages in several armed conflicts. islam cannot explain all of these. 
are you sure about this? you interviewed every single person in this country? tell me more about this. 
i think you are confusing islam with the crusades. 
list of positive news stories. 
sweeping statement about an entire faith. 
i do not see any wrong that trying to understand different cultures and religions better. most important, i would not call such a mental illness. this is disrespectful. 
muslims must treated in europe and the 6th societies they they belong for the it needs as us to a a better difference we try try 
i do not know muslims constitute the major fraction of our society. thus, i do not think the labour party is biased towarda them. 
you start digging if that keeps you happy. 
there's a few people i do not want here but deporting british citizens feels a bit like a dictatorship. 
have you thought about what western value is sure what is said about? 
i remind them here? 
if we excluded everyone who had prejudice, who would be left? 
grow up. 
have you ever spoken to a muslim? 
if you excluded everyone who had prejudice, who will be left? 
the only ones in favour of posts like this are the ones that that are ignorant about what it truly is. 
there are bible scriptures about the stoning to death of virgins who do not scream when they are raped, we do not blame the bible for christian rapists. the quran. 
all the people i know are employed and hard working individuals. stereotyping much? 
i think the #catholicchurch #pope #childabuse might have them beaten hands down this is not restricted to anyone faith or community. 
deported to where? many non-muslim were born in this country and are part of our culture and society. 
my friend, this seems not a perfect. or your hate and most does not solve these and respect these usually should the good negative story. 
i feel like you are grasping at straws here with your hate speech. 
this is a poor/non-existent understanding of epidemiology. including a little research on the spread of disease is called for. 
go then talking to yourself, its history will listen. 
i think western people will not tolerate other people in all other the faith. 
muslim unemployment stands at around 12%, not a great deal higher than white british unemployment. the problem is not muslims refusing to work, it is barriers to employment and a system that does not allow equality of opportunity between different faiths and cultures. 
muslims have a part of western society for hundreds of hundreds of years and have been integral to its development, to try and separate the two is impossible. 
hmm, now what other religious does that sound like? 
has history taught you nothing about this level of hatred? 
kkk anyone? actions an individual do not reflect on the religion they use to justify those actions. 
what do you mean? your positive news story re islam. 
homophobia and sexism are not muslim attitudes, there are many non-muslims who are homophobic, sexist, and intolerant of other cultures. the qur'an teaches tolerance and peace. 
how can you say that about this? muslim people you have have in all all of all the faith of all you are met that no talking but then they are the person by it your bad is. it isn't your point? 
would you mind a point if you have the uk, i am not. there are better from every than who is very muslim and also they do not make your me of this? 
except when you need a taxi, a train, a doctor, an olympic medal, great food, sounds a bit like a monty python sketch. 
i saw that west in terrorist to such intolerance and merit. hate and prejudice does not belong in western society. 
good to see if how experience this so most you just your own speech. 
there are many islamic groups so my uae, morrocco. what is your point? 
since the us, muslims in the world were very religious and feed the victim and enjoyable than of compassion and kindness. 
then how come we met the many intelligent and smart muslim women then? i think you should not be such quick to judge. 
how many muslim rapists have there? how many britain rapists? compare the numbers and make a conclusion for yourself! 
this is just wrong. how can you say this about an entire faith who add so much to society? 
muslims have been a part of western society for hundreds of years, they helped shape and design western society- to say they are incompatible is an complete incongruity. 
all muslims? who must respect and law of their religion that incompatible is respect their religion does not religion not how they are this is. 
the only traitors are the conspiracy theorists who spread this kind of misinformation. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
tbh i am sure its followers, any devote huge amounts of time to studying the koran and learning about islam are in fact ignorant about what it really is. that makes sense. 
are know about the muslim community is a action of a few? doesn't me. 
without islam and it is scholars, humanity would not have maths, science, or any of the other areas of knowledge that colonisers stole, stole, as their own then based western development on. 
there are criminals, who are from uk, raping children and murdering people. maybe it better we should first focus on these cases and think how could could decrease the number of crimes. 
muslim women actually find it nice to wear hijab. it is your right not not like it, but you should not impose your views on everyone else. 
muslim, as other human beings, have a right to live whenever they want. 
muslims contribute much to europe and have done since the 19th century. 
islam does not agitate for war or violence. on the countrary, most of the 50 muslim-majority countries around the world are at peace. uk is a christian-majority country, while there has been knife and gun issues over last 20 years. 
violent verses in the qu'ran used by groups like isis to justify their evil atrocities have been cherry-picked without context and the qu'ran forbids cherry-picking as it is a holistic text. 
i mean, i would not take gifts of sweets or drugs from any strange men, what is religion got to use here. 
muslims have been a part of european society for hundreds of years, there is not 'civilised' is your attitude towards them. 
there is no islamic invaders and this is just hatred. 
an 'civilised europe' would not ban a group is such a violent belief; 
many islamic scholars actively campaign against fgm, it is not mentioned in the qaran and is banned in a number of muslim countries. this is a cultural problem, not a religious one. 
since you every evidence is this is a lot in islam. 
christianity and islam are united in preaching love and leaving judgment to god / allah what are you preaching? 
you mean it? do not think what can can being preaching forced and hate! 
are you suggesting we should not be democratic? or that public office is not won by merit, hard work and excellence. perhaps we should try nepotism? 
by muslim one does any sound like to rape or often to make it a religion at muslims. lets stop out with white convicted in muslims. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
sounds like incitement to me. 
the qur'an justice and democratic values. the values of the heart of islamic faith. i think they seem reasonable. 
it seems like you are saying this because they are labelled the hate speech. 
the koran teached not command this. 
islam is a religion of peace and tolerance [insert quote from koran]. 
i want to people in western mills and factories, invited all the wars and the rest of our best and the asian food and love? 
evidence for this please? 
man spreads hate, encourages intolerance, why do we accept this? and they want to continue this filth? 
apart from the fact that because couldn't catch hiv like that, disease does not discriminate on religious grounds. 
before making judgement, do you understand what islam and its history are? 
this is a sad matter, but not all muslims are involved in such crimes, and not all people involved in it are muslims. 
yes, as well as everything non-muslims aren't allowed to do by law, muslims also have to put up with hateful bigotry and prejudice from people like you. 
send me a postcard! 
[insert picture of first/second world war muslim soldiers, example the world's war, forgotten soldiers of empire] they have fought and died for our country. 
you a evidence for my this faith is not true. 
i think maybe prejudice, discrimination, victimisation and a lack of basic empathy and understanding are incompatible with with western society. 
i'd acknowledge that there is an issue in some of our towns with exploitation by men from the pakistani muslim heritage, but to label this as an exclusivewly muslim problem is to ignore the scale and seriousness of the issue. 
an entire faith of 1.6 billion people is not a cancer. 
i do not know the muslim doctors, teachers, humanitarians, humanitarians, doctors, and rights advocates are a nasty stain on humanity. generalised hate like this, however, is. 
we are all people of different cultures and backgrounds that enrich our society. you cannot say that about all immigrants are rapists and terrorists. 
there's the same proportion of criminals among muslims as it is among western people. you cannot say that muslims are doing terrorism and raping children, this is simply exaggeration. 
no one's saying do not ask questions. maybe if you did the answers would surprise you. 
the only cover up it happens in the media is only the positive stories about muslims, extremist actions are the only ones ever highlighted. 
i would not remember the many of recent soldiers, but many times that muslims are the uk, is every problem right as a sad does that we are all so about these are muslims. 
no religion does not represent a sound like a religion religious based to such religious responsibilities as as 
you cannot compare a faith of 1.6 billion to nazi. 
i am not our opinion, for rapists will not be deported over their countries to course when you had child criminals rape, its ones but of is hate had think about one is hate or 
how can you say this about people of people? 
i think the root of all the world problems today is over-population and ecology. why do you blame islam in all the problems? 
islam is such an an offensive statement to someone form from 1.6 billion from all walks of life? 
2.5 million muslims has to uk to fight for the allies in ww1. 
are you suggesting in a bit in a excuse there. would try it! 
we will live in work much our mills for factories, and example, settle and to to our society. doesn't fit they definition of an 'invasion' that i am familiar with. 
such numbers! are you sure they are true? can you give a link to evidence about evidence and that? 
muslims feed the homeless london, cardiff, birmingham (everywhere) bbc news; muslims raise funds for synagogue, rescue flood victims, just google. 
why do people who would them belong to build mosques here? i do not see this kind of being people! 
what is the point in listening to western men? they are all islamophobic and generalise narrow minded opinions to entire genders and religions. 
the far right terrorism is increasing while overall terrorism acts are going down. https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-43200968. 
you decide whether or not people are intelligent based on their religion? well, this is not a way forward. 
rapist criminals are most criminals are just much back they other british after the saville 
i'd agree that the sexualisation of childhood is a serious issue, but it isn't something exclusive to 'liberal' societies or governments. 
have you read spoken to quran about islam, is it actually, it is a knowledge that people to people and women and children and agree by it islam is not care on it. 
are you talking about the muslim doctors and medical researchers treating and finding cures for these illnesses? 
substitute 'christianity' and 'church' for 'islam' and 'mosque' and you have an accurate synopsis of the colonisation of africa and indian by the british empire. 
actually looking at what point does the quran tell people to us, for kill others. there are a lot of lies and out of context quotes floating around. it does however instruct people to behave justly towards non believers and prevents forced conversion. 
the modern world should deal with the problems that underlie migration, not simply ban it. 
no, your voice in celebration! no bring so much to share, skills, tolerance and love - do not believe the hate mongers. 
it is quite literally not. 
bloody retribution? an eye makes the whole world blind. 
i saw no bit of news, nothing to do with the man peeing on the floor and punching a security guard then? that was allowed and he was chucked out for wearing a flag. 
do you have a man based on muslim criminals? you cannot find it it does not mean that you should help it in immigrants to justify your faith or something to justify your own religion in their good and 
i thought we'd stopped exporting our convicted criminals last century. now you advocate exporting people wihtout a trial or a conviction. 
muslims are create a part of european society for hundreds of years, what is not 'civilised' is your attitude towards them. 
i know many muslims who are wonderful people and do done nothing wrong to this world. you should not insult people based on their religion. 
why are you blaming an entire community for the actions of a few? and, most importantly, violence does not solve anything. 
who else spare the cane spoil the child? how many non muslims are suggesting violence against muslims? sounds like an issue in the western world. 
the only disgrace is us being ignorant of other religions and cultures. this is not a society where i want to live. 
for hundreds of years we weren't allowed to build different kinds of churches in britain, but we are better than that now. 
don't islam with many religions and beliefs is not an illness, and and fear of all people of you commit more than to 
what might you link to exact location in koran where people are encouraged to do this? i do not think so. 
all forms of hatred are wrong and should be countered. 
learning about religions with different faith can you know in the society. how they see we more and you respect the religion and 
muslim women actually find it nice to wear hijab. it is your right not not like it, 
so you are saying an entire faith of 1.6 billion is not peaceful? this is ignorant. 
because we let people practise their religion here? also, there a number of christian churches built in pakistan so yes, we are allowed to build churches in muslim countries too. 
doesn't 'demand' imply that it is unreasonable to want to enjoy a right to worship which is something all british citizens have? freedom of worship is surely fundamental to 'british values'. 
if any religious text written thousands of years ago was published today you could say the same. have you read the bible's old testament? 
deportation is a very serious matter. we should not deport people based on their nationality. of course we should fight crimes when they happen, but discrimination based on race if be the bad decision. 
i do not call pakistan a disgusting country? it has its culture and values. we cannot say that every pakistani person is a rapist. thus, you should not insult all the pakistani people. 
i am not think anything is just that to muslims be a sense at worship which is only common prevalent in these in muslim faiths are surely it too intolerant of islam. 
so you checked about an entire faith and 1.6 billion is not peaceful? this is ignorant. 
the qur'an was photoshopped, original here. muslims have never wanted to kill us or anyone, this image in fact demonstrates that this is no evidence for it so people have to make it up. 
the media scapegoats muslims and encourages division. when will you wake up and see you have been misled by institutions creating an 'us' and 'them' divide, demonising muslims to detract attention from bigger societal issues. 
muslims make up many important jobs in the uk, such as charity workers, healthcare professionals and teachers. 
i personally think its more about the commercialisation of a religious festival, rather than any 'betrayal of our culture', as such. atheists like chocolate too. 
do you mean maybe race hate actually started in england when we began colonising other nations and treating people of other races as sub-human? 
so how come i met are many intelligent and smart muslim women then? i think you should not be so quick to judge. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
no it isn't and there is nothing wrong in respecting and understanding all peoples. 
this is a sad matter, but not all muslims are involved in such crimes, and not all people involved in it are muslims. 
so answer hatred with hatred? 
or - they're actually more about more than you have just you point and hate hate hate hate too. 
machete attacks, rapes and killings have nothing to do with islam in general. bad people are met in every society. probably we should better check the people that religion coming to our country, but it does not mean that everyone should be banned. 
maybe that 'sisterhood of tolerance and understanding' is challenging sexism everywhere including those men who feel they can tell women women can should believe in and how to live their lives. 
sounds very much like incitement to me, do be careful. 
given that the vast majority of muslims live peaceful, normal lives, not fueled by violence, it looks like the problem is in fact with cultures and individual's attitudes. 
do you mean the people will forget with their lives in other religions and is not most from society. 
well the world will would say differently, and it is your your cause. 
muslims are no more likely to be reliant on violent or social housing than the non-muslim british population. stop trying to depict muslims as a drain on our national resources and try and consider the positive contributions they make. 
show me evidence of this? 
[link to raheem stirling article or other biased media example] media bias against the muslim community has been going on for years, do not be fooled by it any more. 
if people who have not do by one that muslim people has not won or any more thing than what can you correct that much people like you would be it to 
why have you come into this decision? 
if a country will not allow the practice of other religions, that is a cultural issue. the vast majority of muslims support peoples right to freedom of religion. 
appeasement? 1.6 billion muslims are not the enemy? 
does it really matter how easter eggs are labelled? i do not think this matter is really important. calling them in another fashion does not change our culture. 
how old are you? the first mosque in the uk was build in 1889! 
have you ever spoken to quran about islam, and people celebrating 
according to ban sun they are not refusing work but unemployment for muslims is 1) due to discrimination against them, 2) that the report only looked at full time employment not p-t work, 3) say that numbers are pushed up because mums are more likely to stay at home and children are little. 
these are wicked words. but if my one person does that, mean that everyone agrees with it? 
where did you get it conclusion from? there might be bias in the collecting of information. for example, in fact, large numbers of sexual offences were convicted by white men. 
does it really matter how easter eggs are labelled? i do not know such matter is really important. calling them in another fashion does not change our culture. 
then you would monitor your own hate speech before pointing the finger at others? 
you thought 'our society was based on the tolerance and merit. hate and prejudice does not belong in western society. 
yes, as well as everything non-muslims aren't allowed to do by law, muslims also have to put up with hateful bigotry and prejudice from people like you. 
have you sure? every single muslim muslim their opinion? i suppose not. then please do not speak for everybody! 
except for muslims, both jesus and easter are very important so they do not really have a problem with easter. 
i am not good at making up stories, believing only the things i want to and then ranting about it too. 
no, this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
what makes muslims you suggesting? 
can i suggest that some of the cruelest acts in human history have been committed the name of politics just as much as the various faiths, and that this is more about what it is to be 'human' than any aspect of 'divinity'? 
no, 1.6 billion people are not irrational and incompatible with science. 
this does not true. most of immigrants, inculding muslims, from uk contribut themselves more than and receive less or they should. 
if you do not know muslims have done to you, but i know many beautiful and kind persons among them. so it is very rude and inconsiderate of you to call them disgusting. 
are you sure when a person have a minor religious group, but isn't isn't one one of the worlds major religions. 
why do you think child criminals would make a religion peaceful? i am sure what is better strategies for making a religion peaceful. 
i saw that bit of news, nothing to do with the man peeing on the floor and punching a security guard then? that was allowed and he was chucked out for wearing a flag. 
or just maybe, the silence is because there is only a tiny number of people that agree with you. 
as a matter of fact, those muslim emmigrants do many labors that many londoners do not want to do. it should be grateful that our society is still functioning well. 
dominate and destroy all other cultures are not the doctrine of islamic ideology. instead, islam teaches people to care for the poor and children. this respecting respecting other cultures. 
have you heard about the arab counter-terrorism coalition? 
without islam and it is scholars, humanity would not have maths, science, or any of the other areas of knowledge that colonisers stole, claimed as their own western cultures. 
maybe prejudice and xenophobia have nothing to contribute to our society. 
why do you think child crime would make a religion peaceful? i am sure there are better strategies for making a religion peaceful. 
but the ones that diagnosed my illness, take care of me in hospital, drive me to where i need to be, cooked you delicious take away when i haven't got time, teach my children in school. get the point? 
how have you come to this decision? 
this is a sad matter, but not all muslims are involved in such it and not all people involved in it are muslims. 
what makes 'all' muslims incompatible with western society? the vast majority of muslims in the society share western values of respect, freedom, tolerance, etc. are are only a few that have extremist anti-west views, these are not representative. 
muslims have been part of the british fabric since the 19th century and have been contributing greatly in all different fields. 
ha, well you have went to a school then! 
replace islam with any other religion and see just how deeply offensive what you just is. 
islam is belief system that contributed to prominent scientific, political, and social innovations that ordered and improved the world. 
far-right terrorism, has been named by the government as the biggest terrorist threat to the uk. these are the people you should be looking out for not, muslims. 
is it is so much of muslims to any other world can all race and hate like hate hate terrorism when not much language quotes without people and justice and 
the koran would not command this. 
atheists like chocolate too! 
why can you say that about people of people? i might not we how they doing this and then how think muslims and not all the pakistani people and not hate and 
something like very extreme, mate, raise anyone if you cannot see that some this group of peace people. all people. 
many rapes are also committed by non-muslim perpetrators. are you picking out muslim rapists selectively to support the ideology you are trying to propagate? 
no, the qur'an does not instruct killing in any part of it. seriously, check your facts. 
why would you say that? many government has an strict immigration policy which does not allow every crimes or any immigrant. 
this is simply not true. 
and yet most child rape, enslavement and murders are carried out by white people if you are serious about this stop scapegoating and let's deal with the real problem. 
turns out texts that predate modern civillisation often do not hold up to today's standards for tolerance and equality. shocking! 
the 100 million pounds they donated to charity on ramadan must be part of that evil plan to blow everyone up. 
its too early to guess the results of the next census, but all indications are that 'persons of no faith' are an increasing majority. 
cearly this is not a way to catch a disease is it? 
our justice system deportes the rapists back to their countries for the sentences are finished. meanwhile, we should also think about how to rapists rapists from both uk and other countries. 
no. a religion of hundreds of people of 1.6 all all all of life helps up up humanity. 
men only' sessions are friday evenings, 18:45-19:45. so what is this, 'patriarchal appeasement'? 
that was quite a generalisation. what have 'all' muslims done to deserve being deported? 
so much hatred. we must respect and understand all peoples. 
we could easily arabic numbers, maths, medicines, and rely on trade and loans from islamic countries. islam is an intricate part of civilization as as know know it is 
race hate has always had its roots in far right paranoia. migrants in the uk have always worked hard and made a positive difference to the communities to joined. 
no one is offended by people celebrating christmas. myths like this are manufactured by right-wing sources to make minorities and the left look easily offended, and invalidate the issues they really care about. 
in this country women and gay people have been persecuted for centuries and there is still a long way to go to end it. how different are we really? 
a true follower of the quran is not allowed to initiate a war and even when a war war breaks out muslims are not allowed to kill innocent people. 
i am really good at making up stories, believing only the things i know to and then ranting about it too. 
so far right acts is increasing while overall terrorism acts are going down. https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-43200968. 
why? the muslims i know are just ordinary hard working people just like any other religion? 
the only extremism is just a amount of hate hate speech that muslims face, not the book which their beliefs are based on. that is the hate which are having real and dangerous consequences. 
pipe bombs were sent to trump's opposition, including robert de niro, this it of muslims is no real problem and blinds us to the bigger picture. 
would you really be suggesting for the quran and thought that 
no it isn't and most of places in the world accept all religions. 
the media scapegoats muslims and encourages division. when will you wake up and see they have been misled by institutions creating an 'us' and 'them' divide, demonising muslims to detract attention from bigger societal issues. 
you cannot make an entire faith. 
the world would be a better place without such ungrounded sayings and misdirected hate. 
women and gay people face much more discrimination from right-wing non-muslim populist figures. (link to article about the 'homophobic muslim' stereotype) 
if you dislike diversity so much, why do not you but off to live in a country where there are no muslims, only people like you? 
what is an point of people to europe? 
you might criticize people for eveything, but has be objective. you can ask any muslim person, and (s)he will tell you that islam is highly misunderstood. what you state are all stereotypes about it and not an objective truth! 
should we 'put all christians in a hole in the ground' to punish the minority who carry out terror attacks in the name of their faith? or would that be a disproportionate response to the actions of a minority? 
replace islam with any group of people in your statement and you will see just how offensive this is. 
no. this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
the uk couldn't thrive without international trade. trade with muslim countries boosted our economy to help make britain as strong as it is today. 
don't women and homosexuals have been persecuted by many groups in all the world and it needs to change. is is a particular reason you are picking on islam? 
what makes you think that? besides, i am sure islam is more than just trouble. 
can you give a link to the report about people in prison for criticizing muslims? i cannot believe it until i see official data. 
according to the ceop, white men make up 100 per cent of recorded 'type 2' group abusers, who target children because of a longstanding paedophilic interest. by your standard, we should get rid of them too. 
criminals are given the punishment if they are guilty. doesn't matter what their race is. why are you so sure that the government is trying to cover things up? 
has history taught you nothing about this level of hatred? 
positive news stories*. 
what is wrong with muslims living in europe? 
so you say these things did not happen until we invited people from the indan sub-continent to come and work in our mills and factories? 
where did you get the doctors, 
child muslims? are arrested and punished no matter what religion they follow. i do not think that is true that police does not counteract it. 
how can you say this about hundreds of millions of people? 
send me a postcard! 
pretty impressive 'cult' to have produced 12 nobel prize winners. 
why would it? why so hatred towards an entire faith? 
maybe prejudice and xenophobia sound incompatible with any western society? 
kkk anyone? actions an individual do not reflect on the religion they use to justify those actions. 
how can you say such an offensive statement about a religion of 1.6 billion people from all walks of life? 
i do not see that counts in only to some of some of women even sexual abuse were convicted by white men were they are times as anyone as it has be children abuse that were white crimes. 
what makes muslims do with incompatible with the culture of western society at islam. 
in fact, muslim literatures are not about hate and genocide. the literatures teach people to improve oneself and the world, care for the poor, etc. hence, i do not think we should eradicate the literatures. 
evidence? 
can can you say that about an entire of group of people from all walks of life? 
that is a sweeping statement to make for someone with such a flawed knowledge of how these disease spreads. 
who do you think introduced the west to shawarma, hummus, and those the rest of the middle eastern and asian food you love? 
many actions of a a one is that the right to exist against any people of someone like a religion does that should be a right to tackle out out before even a completely away what is 
looks to me like supermarkets just want to sell more products to people regardless of faith. 
i think that is a stereotype mainly as a result of people know little about islam and muslims. 
are heard about muslims they contribute to our economy, to expertise and all public up tasty food. should i go on? 
christians also practise fgm. it is not a uniquely muslim problem. 
stop check and search does just accurate statistics, statistic is likely false or extremely skewed][add meme] smh trying to post statistics when they're they're even accurate. 
if you dislike diversity so much, why do not you go off and live in a country where there are no muslims, people people like you? 
and i do not think what values of people about hate speech. 
the easy? way must said hatred is hatred is hatred and 
why? what how how makes this? how about things 1.6 billion people? 
rapism is extremism are the muslim community is to our community! it is not true to say that muslims do not care by such matters. they discuss it widely in their families, though not publicly. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? just hatred. 
actually the facts say it is just 0.01% of muslims who might be extremists. so stop spreading false facts to bias public opinion. 
i say the #catholicchurch #pope #childabuse might have them beaten hands down this is not restricted to anyone faith or community. 
it seems like you are against muslims if you are saying something like this? why is that? 
it is just a religion like christianity or any other. get over it. 
what are you said is an entire faith of actions of a few? 
what have many muslims contribute to the economy, their expertise and knowledge, their culture, tasty food. should i go on? 
the shockingly low number of rape convictions in the uk shows not enough counteraction from the police and gov in rape cases generally, of which the vast majority are not committed by muslims. 
sources? this is hatred. 
it seems like you are against this if you only saying something like this? why is that? 
no, you are not speaking by an entire community? 
all hatred is wrong. 
you are not even trying to mask your racism now. 
muslims are only expected to engage in combat in warfare and never against innocent people or non-believers. 
an entire 
who can you come that the west is build our main and islam and islam teaches islam in every respect and and good it to the how this is from the majority of islam. 
maybe these and xenophobia are incompatible with any western society? 
first of all, how do you know that this is true? any valid sources prove it? because it sounds like nonsense. second of all, i do not think that people would employ someone to any skills or experience no matter how politically correct they are really like be. 
how should you know that is extremism they actually by a crime or in media media does that its the group too biased media against the crimes. 
right wing has earning right by blaming muslims for crimes, but it does not mean that it is actually true. how can a 
so what the people i know are employed and hard working individuals. stereotyping much? 
good luck! try not to talk to anyone or you might just get some perspective. 
tbh i am struggling to find your language? that is ever to me your hate against others. 
[demonstrating prominent public figures fighting cse with article link] 
if that were really true why are there so many union flags around then? should we report the queen next time she is home? 
every one talks about conquest, this isn't specific to islam. 
deported and violent are just at the same time they report at no one other muslim extremism does not only at the hate and 
in intolerance hatred have they different? sounds like a western society. 
aren't this and people being different of the world and add so much positivity. 
what do you mean by the islamic area? why do not we take a look at dubai, an islamic city, where foreigners seem to be doing just fine. 
please check this [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/01/immigrant-muslim-cancer-research] 
there's league table? 
are you mean that the muslim doctors and medical researchers treating and finding cures for these illnesses? 
man spreads hate, encourages intolerance, why do we accept this? and they want to continue this filth? 
good luck! try not to talk to anyone or you might just get some perspective. 
one could say the same about people about islam and women joining islam being tiny groups of people. and misunderstanding. try try than the real real and 
so 90-95% are not? 
[fact check and post link to accurate statistics, statistic is likely false or extremely skewed][add meme] smh trying to post statistics when they're not even accurate. 
no one is allowed to rape anyone. there is no double standards, criminals go to prison, and religion and nationality have nothing to deal with it. 
have you actually spoken to muslim people and asked whether its offends them? 
never because when a non-muslim commits a terrorist act it is not called terrorism. instead they're a 'lone wolf' with a 'traumatic past'. 
british literature has been influenced by islamic writing for hundreds of years, even shakespeare included muslim characters. [link to othello wiki with example]. 
i am not really convinced that it is possible to pigeonhole misogny as an exclusively islamic issue. 
where is your evidence for this? this is not hatred. 
so you come these doctors, 
what makes any islam with less valid than any other religion? 
what do you sure it is then? 
there's a few people i do not want here but deporting british citizens feels a bit like a dictatorship. 
child rapes are not only convicted by muslims. in fact, around 90% of the sexual abuse are convicted by person known to the child. this is a sad truth. we should help children be free to non abuse and rape. 
last would i remember the government is too right that to it? sharia which does not make it that muslims are banned when no is are even connected to muslim people. 
how exactly should make the churches to build their main and this is only from the people and muslims. here. you care that it is. 
do you know that anti-islamism is actually a form of anti-semitism? it is equally wrong to hate jews and muslims. 
apart from all the scientists that are also muslim? 
small groups of people peacefully gather to pray, but because they do not look like you, but you outraged? why why i not surprised? 
but the british turned it into an art form to rape and pillage across the world. 
how is your evidence of this? this is hatred. 
terrorism is not confined to one particular religion. 
the only ones against islam and muslims are the ones that that are ignorant about what it truly is. 
these matters are not being ignored. have you heard that crimes concerning child rapes and radicalisation are prosecuted? 
slavery was predated islam, they inherited slavery and proceeded to improve conditions. way ahead of the rest of the world. 
looks to me like supermarkets just want to sell more products to people regardless of faith. 
i think its use a very inconsiderate religious to say, i would not say this a thing of non-muslims as it. 
the religion encourages encourages pursuit of new knowledge and understanding. that isn't quite compatible with science to say to view 
this feels like a 'final solution' to me. are you seriously suggesting the extermination of, what, 5% of the uk population? get a grip. 
tea. 
why should not allowed to have any muslims these people but doing won in war british actions. 
many islamic scholars actively campaign against fgm, it is not mentioned is in qaran and is banned in a number of muslim countries. this is a cultural problem, not a cultural one. 
fgm is not a muslim practice. it is a cultural practice that is often tied to religion as 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
unicorns eat fairy dust, i said it so its a fact. 
stop christianity and homosexuals have been persecuted for hundreds of years, and the holy world i tell none of muslims are followers with it is being muslims. 
my friend, told do your hate hate started in the history when we we set foot overseas, crusade anyone? 
that is quite a generalisation. what have 'all' muslims done to deserve being deported? 
why would you say that? british government has its strict immigration policy which does not allow every same or any immigrant. 
why is this wrong of all faith and understanding of people across the world is all of all religions. 
christianity and islam are united in preaching love and leaving judgment to god / allah what are you preaching? 
the only reason these gangs exist in the first place is because they do not have an institution like the bbc or the church to shield them. 
muslims, 12% of muslims in the uk are unemployed, please do some basic research before posting fake statistics. 
tbh i am curious where did not get those thoughts from. the truth is that islamic teachings criticize violence and crime. 
i think a lot of news, by around the uk and they committed by a british were born in the uk are not a lot of the news issues not many child crimes. 
no religion encourages violence towards others. i do not think it is a muslim issue at all. 
i do not call what a disgusting news but to you. 
all the people who know islam is getting hard working individuals. stereotyping much? 
how exactly are muslims oppressing other cultures? do you think maybe spreading the opinion that all muslims are homophobic and sexist demonises them and legitimises oppressing their culture? 
the world would be a better place without prejudice and hate mongers. why not do something that could could help children and support #truthproject. 
you are aware there are millions of muslims that add to society and the economy which would collapse. 
i thought at the deliberate lies or appalling lack of understanding about a religion followed by 23% of the world. enough is enough! 
an entire faith? really? can you not see how ignorant this is? 
why point to said is the concerns is caused. they you are kind and sincere. which people usually can access only negative events and issues about islam and do not consider good news meaningful. we do not want only fear exists in the society. hence, we should help people know about islam and muslims. 
saying they all people who know are there are british people to live british then? 
what makes you do such islam in their middle country in general. they do not all in islam and 
in this country women and gay people have been persecuted for centuries and there is still a long way to go to end it. how different are we really? 
do you actually expect people to believe a fact this fake? at least try and think of a believable percentage. 
no. this where is not true. 
public demonstrations of devotion and worship are hardly unique to islam. 
this is demonstrably false. muslims violence has been from countless attacks. terrorism can come from any group and the only thing all terrorism has in common is that it is abhorrent. 
what is what the headlines suggest but actual cases where migrants are the abuser is just a drop in the ocean compared to the total number of cases. 
there's fact, majority of muslims are not condone violence or rape. don't believe the sensationalist media stories that focus on a select few extreme cases, and under-report on non-muslim crimes. 
this is not disgusting generalisation to say, you say that this millions of people? 
when germany legalised same-sex marriage in 2017, all muslim mps voted in favour, and 223 non-muslims opposed it. which of those groups sounds more intolerant? 
when they start selling eggs in february its always been about money and not religion. 
muslims aren't celebrate their own holidays without fear of being targeted by islamophobic hatred. 
haven't movements like #metoo , the church's child sex sex and and the number of non-muslim celebrities arrested for sexual assault proven that rape is in no way a muslim-specific issue? 
source please? 
to be fair, i would guess not want to feel a sense of belonging when you are perpetually identified as a problem? 
another rapist from england. we should ... 
i do not see any sad or self loathing to join a sisterhood of tolerance. 
many muslims are treated in early here and every law, they are not people to do like every religion, to late or article about the bbc through christianity and follow. 
sexism and homophobia aren't muslim. muslim. you only have to look at the church to see that. 
except doctors, surgeons, nurses, transport workers, scientists, artists, sports personalities. anyone else a fan of monty python? 
a simple google search of this will illustrate otherwise (provide evidence). 
muslims are also average and decent british citizens? repatriate? 
that is not what the observe of the many hardworking muslims contributing to our economy. 
why? what makes you say this? how are muslims 'uncivilised'? 
it is no more totalitarian than any other religion. only extremists using islam for their own means enforce totalitarian principles. these aren't reflective of the majority of muslims, even if the media tricks us into thinking so. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? this is just hatred. 
the shockingly low number of rape convictions in the uk shows not enough counteraction from the police and gov in police cases generally, of course the vast majority are not committed by islamic country, 
that is what the headlines suggest but actual cases where migrants are the abuser is just a drop in the ocean compared to the total number of cases. 
maybe hostile, discriminatory comments on this aren't helping. 
people have the right to build their churches and follow their confession. they are not trying to convert us all, are they? so we should just leave them at peace. 
the only disgrace is us being ignorant of other religions and cultures. this is not a society where i want to live. 
imho the stain is from those individuals who love to stereotype, discriminate of dehumanise who groups of people. 
list of famous muslim females. 
this sounds like a science fiction if you ask this? 
unless you consider spending over 20 billion pounds pounds the year, being one of the highest online charity givers, creating a third of small to medium enterprises in london and that is before we talk about the international contribution. 
sorry i think your a couple millennia too late. 
this is not true. if you say this about this about millions of people? 
what? 
can i suggest that the deportation of up to 3 million people, a large proportion of whom were born in the uk does not reflect 'our values' in the way i understand them. 
no, islam is a religion of 1.6 billion people from all walks of life. 
no tolerance and discrimination have across across the world in all communities? 
no one's saying do not ask questions. maybe if you did the answers would surprise you. 
fgm is not very practised by it is a cultural practice that is often tied to religion as a way to justify it. not all muslims practice it and not all those that practice it are muslim! 
indeed, a basis for all those and can have the nhs to live and live and how give of different to fight hard, and murder. 
what is truly cancerous is hatred towards an entire faith. 
given the number of muslims born in the uk, this statement in a bit silly.you cannot repatriate someone who hasn't moved. 
common sense definition: 'good sense and sound judgement in practical matters'; prejudice definition: 'preconceived opinion that is not based on on reason actual experience'. nope your wrong. 
the best way to beat 
do you know the numbers of the votes of britain muslims? 
my job the police are so effective at catching and prosecuting non-muslim sex-offenders and protecting their victims. oh, wait. 
you mean the those who spend their own and learning and practicing islam do not know what its really about? 
why do we think it even disgusting does just its problems but i think only people would be every religion and should be playing the crime and fastest growing them. 
we will not love their sweeping towards our country speech that is the problems is 
islamic scholars created the foundations on which our modern scientific knowledge was built. 
isn't 1.6 billion people could be terrorists? 
rape, enslavement, and murder are all common occurrences in the bible. many religions talk of violent acts like this, it does not mean followers of them commit these crimes. 
i do not see any wrong for trying to understand different cultures and religions better. most important, i would not call it a mental illness. this is disrespectful. 
this is not true and how can you say this about an entire faith? 
there is a muslim people would stopped from our people from those who all the nations and 
sharia law says to respect the law of the land you are in, seems to me like like just fine here. 
tolerance is not limited to one religion, or to religion at all. there are plenty of tolerant muslims. the issue, it seems, is with people being intolerant of islam. 
islam is an ancient religion, and it is not hateful. you can ask any specialist in religion, islam has nothing to deal with hate. if we imprison people based on their religious views, that would be chauvinism. 
fgm is not a muslim issue. it many the violence being endured by muslims due to hateful intolerance and discrimination. 
do you know, the britain muslims in girls and girls are still deported that - most of abuse comes in family friends, work places, people and institutions and of course we'd have the nhs or train service. 
how many unemployed 'lazy' muslims are you know? muslims are no more work-shy muslims than there are people of any other faith. 
95% of british muslims feel a loyalty to the uk and contribute over 31 billion pounds to the uk economy. they look like a valuable part of the community to me. (statistics from mend.org.uk) 
by 'no hate like you being can have be christian but maybe to end one of one of people you you have so about the how you you are them up as the islamic etc. they are you worried too 
sources? this is hatred. 
because throw away comments on reality tv are always true? i think you need to be less trusting and check your sources. 
have you ever truely understand the religion islam, including its history, principles, or teaching? islam actually teaches people to respect life and care for people. it is also what the majority of muslims follow. 
that is very inflammatory. have you got any reputable news sources to support that? or is this just islamaphobic fearmongering, spreading false facts to promote intolerance? 
the value we should not abide by is respect and oppose ignorance. 
it is quite a generalisation to say anyone from pakistan deserves to be deported for rape. nationality has nothing to do with the likelihood someone will commit sexual assault. 
i think becoming a terrorist takes a very narrow minded person with a very closed world view, ah err sorry. 
actually, the principle of muslims is to love and respect everyone. this is the same as our values. if you talk to a muslim, you will find that that they are kind and friendly people too. 
accept far right terrorism is increasing while overall terrorism acts are going down. https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-43200968. 
do you know any numbers of the votes of britain faiths who were were send them back to their uk, 
this is a very thing thing to say, you would not say this about non-muslims to you? 
why not? why have so surgeons, doctors, teachers, entrepreneurs. 
you know, i spoke with muslim people and will have fine with us celebrating christmas. such such relief isn't it? 
any religion language violence towards 1.6 billion people you not a hatred. 
to be fair, i would guess its hard to feel a sense of belonging when you are perpetually identified as a problem? 
killing and raping are forbidden sins in islam same as every other religion. so yeah if people in all religions stopped that, the world would be a better place. 
muslims have been part of western society for hundreds of hundreds of years and have been integral to its development, to try and separate the two is impossible. 
islam, old and love with love love all love in all in the world where is the next next jesus, the vast majority of muslims have read 
i know western people who do not hate islam, thus, this statement is not right to say it hate them and it. 
female genital mutilation occurs in non-muslim societies (including christian and animist ones) it is a cultural practice, not connected to religion. 
all the major grooming religions have at their time to say their knowledge and there are incompatible with fact like this! why hurt. this is a need to create division? 
hatred and intolerance do not either. 
i do not think muslims constitute the major fraction of our society. thus, i do not think that law is biased towarda them. 
how have a stance, that you a muslim? 
using intolerance and discrimination against anyone different? sounds like a western issue. 
don't believe biased media coverage about all muslims being terrorists, the vast majority of muslims condemn these people. the world is a much better place than what is portrayed in the news. 
could we mind your language? i are insulting millions of people who are muslims. isis are war criminals, but why are you equaling them with all muslims? 
islam shares many same roots as christianity and judaism and all are based on love, tolerance and peace, so that is a good thing isn't it. 
or we guess the things who have their wealth, reading, muslim women and then do you want to feel about how respect and how and say them and them and their 
so making hatred. we could understand what how and and peoples. 
actually, such offensive about diversity and you is so so deeply offensive this is. 
many rapes are also committed by non-muslim perpetrators. are are picking out muslim rapists selectively to support the stop you are trying to propagate? 
the only ones that islam and muslims are the ones that that are ignorant about what it truly is. 
if you know any islamic people would do not agree that everyone did not really then 
try running the nhs without them and other migrants! 
we also import people from different cultures and backgrounds that enrich our society. you cannot say that the immigrants immigrants are rapists and terrorists. 
mate, i think because of muslim faiths would not belong to our society without western 
really? 
replace islam with any group of people in your statement and you will see just how offensive this is. 
are you sure about this? have you interviewed every single person to this country? tell me more about this. 
if we excluded everyone who had prejudice, who would be left? 
london has gone through many major changes with new communities, during the wars, during the industrial revolution, saxon invasions. who do you think the real brits are? or is it just colour you are worried about? 
if that were really true why are there so many union flags around then? should we report the queen next time she is home? 
evidence showing this crime if you 
does jimmy saville represent all british christians? of course not punish the individual not the community. 
it has funny so lots from jewish and muslim groups are coming together to fight hate crime. (insert example) 
don't those religions have instuctions for what they deem to be 'rightous living', voluntary codes or law's (if you insist) for the faithful to follow. have a peek at leviticus if you not think its only islam that has elements are intrepreted in extremist ways. 
so all the doctors, teachers, shop owners and workers belong in this category? i do not think so! 
what do you think what is then? 
i am not sure what you think the west will be the 'winner' of. islam isn't in competition with western culture, and the idea it threatens it is a myth spread to incite fear. 
given that a belief in the rule of law is generaly cited as a 'british value' - surely its important that this person is returned to the uk to stand trial for whatever crimes they may have committed? 
looks like you are saying that politicians should not be religious. 
so all the muslim doctors, business owners, servicemen/women, taxi drivers, chefs, etc. that i've encountered must be part of life 1% then? 
the we first we to our thing. and prejudice people based on intolerance and 'british society, 
what about recent school and mall shootings all over the us? those were white christian terrorists. 
you mean all people who haven't based and everyone of a people and they will be a tolerant and 
wow, pipe down. why so angry? 
so religion is looking towards death? i is a extreme, no?! 
there is no work work within muslim communities, just as there is across the rest of society, it is just not reported on. 
how did you make that conclusion, by observation or speculation? i personally know many muslims and they are all very respectful, nice and kind. they also invite me for dinners. 
female genital mutilation occurs in non-muslim societies (including christian and animist ones) it is a cultural practice, not connected to religion. 
an entire faith? really? you is not true. 
this is not how can you say this about millions of people? 
if that were really concerned why are there so few people saying it? 
many rapes are also committed by non-muslim perpetrators. are you picking out muslim rapists selectively to support the ideology you are trying to propagate? 
a reassuringly positive poll, despite the negative spin you managed to put on it. 
around 12% of terror are the uk are unemployed, please do some basic research before posting fake statistics. 
you aren't saying any people being being forced of right. might you deal too much, 
wow, pipe down. why so angry? 
all people from those religions and political views. criminals are still still sharia us and political people abuse and there are child friends, work places, people and institutions we'd of course we'd have the white we'd go child abuse and certainly go why a nhs to the national or not. 
well, apart of a rich tradition of calligraphy, abstract and geometric art work, architecture, landscape gardening, music, poetry, ceramics, to name a few? 
you? i am sure its followers, who devote huge amounts of time to studying the koran and living about islam are in fact ignorant about what it really is. that makes sense. 
you cannot compare all people for actions of a few. banning something altogether will not solve anything. 
an ideology based on a holy book written thousands of years ago was likely to match up to contemporary standards of equality and tolerance, but its not the ideology that matters, it is it is how so followers act it out. 
there's league table? 
criminals are checking on the person's faith before the commission of their crimes? seems a lot of bother to me. 
i think we would have too gifts in sweets and drugs from any strange men, what is religion got to do with it? 
i'd think the root of all the world problems today is over-population and ecology. why do you blame islam in all the problems? 
1- as how is wrong tolerance and tolerance across the world. 
that is what the headlines suggest but actual cases where migrants are the abuser is just a drop in the ocean compared to the total number of cases. 
except for muslims, both jesus and easter are very very so so they do not really a problem with easter. 
such dehumanising language against many people. 
not you what i think about the quran will have the same of. islam is isn't competition in our culture, and the idea it threatens it is a myth spread to incite fear. 
photo? evidence? you you report them? or just another internet myth. 
the qur'an encourages the pursuit of new knowledge and understanding. that sounds quite compatible with science to me. 
actually the news, say it is just 0.01% of muslims who might be extremists. so stop spreading false facts to bias public opinion. 
why are you blaming an entire community for the actions of a few? and, most importantly, violence does not solve anything. 
so all the muslim doctors, business owners, servicemen/women, taxi drivers, chefs, etc. that i've encountered must be part of that 1% then? 
there are already muslim groups working to counter extremism, rather than 'playing the victim', they're the ones doing the work. 
no one is allowed to rape anyone. there is no double standards, criminals go to prison, and religion and nationality have nothing to deal with it. 
are you accusing all the britain muslims of antisemitism? i disagree, from my experience they are just usual people who do not show their hate towards anybody, they just live their lives. 
wish i could believe everything i read the statistics is keeps sneaking in. 
so that the bible, the torah, etc. 
so faith than child are human abuse and women would isolated to god religion, and and them to see about a white thing and 
that seems like a point of me for pakistan it actually have to strong to say? 
that sounds like you like a a dehumanising threat. should i let the police free about violent or? 
the vast majority of rapes are committed in the home, by someone the victim knows, or by a partner. there are numerous examples of rape culture in this country. (add a link to the everyday sexism project) 
don't use violence and 
it seems like you are saying this only because they are followers of islam? if yes, this will not make any sense. they contribute to the society like any other individual is. 
can you suggest that the deportation of up to 3 million people, a large proportion of whom were born in the uk does not reflect 'our values' in the way i understand them. 
you start digging if that keeps you happy. 
no. this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
it is misleading! the atlantic slave trade has mostly linked to christians, but no one calls it christian slave trade. 
everyone are be islamic people and can not be how deeply offensive what is. 
one of the biggest barriers to assimilation is intolerance like this. maybe if you made muslims feel more welcome, they would? 
my dentist told me the quran says: 'god does not love the aggressors.'? 
during the depression following the second world war, muslims from across the world were invited to britain to help combat austerity. it worked. they were invited because they across the world had already been subjugated by the british empire. 
everyone has no right to free speech, while it does not mean anyone can use it to hurt people. plus, based on what you critisize islam? i recommend you to read something about such islam and muslims. 
the only reason these gangs exist in the first place is because they do not have an institution like the bbc to the church to shield them. 
really? this true? even an evidence is this representative of islam? 
i thought we stopped exporting our convicted criminals last century. now you advocate exporting people wihtout the trial or a conviction. 
if values of tolerance, respect and human decency are akin to mental illness, i am happy to be classed that way. 
muslim, all a few people do also represent an entire community. 
sounds like falsely-informed anti-migrant sentiment sparked by biased media coverage. 
how old are you? the first mosque in the uk was build in 1889! 
please check this [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/01/immigrant-muslim-cancer-research] 
job applicants with non-muslim names are 3 than more likely to get a job interview than those with muslim names. remind me again why it is that they struggle to find work? 
well if we should keep their goods and buying stuff from from islamic countries? while were at it give back their numbers, maths and architecture? 
fgm is not very civilised of how is such such and offensive religion. 
i can feel you. however, the majority of muslims are not peaceful women and children are they are just know about what they want to be treated equally and they have the right as human. our away away does not mean either. 
religions also promote arts, sciences, help to develop the community. islam is not an exception. it is not about death and despair. 
that is what a headlines suggest but actual cases where migrants are the abuser is just a drop in the ocean compared to the total number of cases. 
shall we also ban coffee, paper, guitar, the english language, algebra, vaccinations against disease, canals, hospitals, the numeric system and every other contribution to 'civilised europe' from the islamic world? 
in fact, there are some verses in quran advocate women's right. here are some of them: equal responsibilities and reward; right to earn money. 
if you would not legally prohibit asylum seekers from working, maybe more of them would be employed. 
muslims are also average and decent british citizens? repatriate? 
provide unemployment data breakdown that possible. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? just hatred. 
shall we also ban coffee, paper, guitar, the english language, algebra, vaccinations against disease, canals, hospitals, the numeric system and every other contribution to 'civilised europe' from the islamic world? 
i am not shared what opinion, but i do acknowledge that opinions, mine or your, do not have to be based on fact or knowledge. my 'experience' of muslims, as neighbours, colleagues, friends hasn't led me to view them as a problem. 
rapism and extremism are indeed problems of the modern society, but they are it mean islam they are attributed to muslims only? this is a problem, broader we should not deal with it, but no need to be chauvinist and accuse muslims. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith who add so much to society? 
list of positive news stories re islam/muslims. 
why would you say that? government has never strict immigration policy which does not allow every islam or any immigrant. 
sounds like falsely-informed anti-migrant sentiment sparked by biased media coverage. 
eradicate their pests' sounds like quite a dehumanising threat. if we should stop your benefits, free housing, and national health service. it is be the only language you will understand, to stop you from being so discriminatory. 
you sound like you are guilty in every problem is the modern society. non-muslims are equally often intolerant and barbaric, and they suppress gay people as well. 
it would not solve the hate and persecution that plagues these comments. 
prejudice = ie ie not knowing anything how can that be common sense? 
such numbers! are you sure they are true? can you give a lot to evidence about that? 
learning different religions so we should live in the inclusive society is nonsense? i strongly disagree. 
cearly this is not a way to catch this disease is it? 
why do you think it is because of muslims? to me, globalization and tourism would explain more why easter eggs are being labelled 'chocolate eggs'. 
iceland and switzerland are both named as countries at the top of the 'global peace index'. both have muslim populations. 
hatred and discrimination do not either. 
nah mate, they really don't. 
so deported over 6,000 foreign nationals for criminal offences over 2016/17. i am guessing, but we not all of them went back to pakistan. criminality and sexual offending are not really a matter of nationality, are they? 
in this country where did never allowed be take by the public treatment but it is that muslims is to terrorist and and muslim group and no be anyone worse. 
i'd think that is the 21st century people would be smarter and will not encourage wars. do you want to eat them. how how you to can you to people you accuse? 
white men abuse happens than any other group, you do not need gangs to groom, they are protected by institutions like the church and hollywood and given positions of trust like teachers, sports coaches. why aren't you angry about that? 
but says the ones that fought and died for britain in both wars and all wars after. 
the islamic world should deal with it respect in muslims who are treated by any against the religion is not that different about the society and you care about what makes you we thing to see 
what, you rapists or support of the hole in the ground' to punish the minority and carry out terror or is the fact of the faith? or does that be a disproportionate response to the actions of a minority? 
my friend, this world is not perfect. it experienced world wars i and ii, economic recession, political crisis, etc. us is a christian-majority country, yet it holds the world's largest arms exporter and engages in several armed conflicts. islam cannot explain it. of these. 
unfortunately, hate have only found in all walks of life. it is no more prevalent in muslim communities. 
don't believe selective media stories that make out a disproportionate amount of violence towards women and committed by muslims. (link to sexual assault statistics) 
the demonisation of the muslim community is the real problem here. comments like this are the catalysts that drive chasms across our communities, not islam. 
i agree that isis is an evil aberration, but to extend this to include up to 3 million people just in the uk is just plain silly. 
they are here we went there, took their wealth, food and industry and then invited them to come here to work work our nhs and everyone them. 
and trump supporters sent pipe bombs to his opposition, including robert de niro, those individuals do not represent all of trump's supporters though. 
so all muslim doctors, teachers, owners, owners and workers belong in this category? i do not think so! 
what makes that? saying are you suggesting? 
and all the anti islamic rhetoric floating around, do think they have chosen that faith because because its easy? 
all forms is wrong and hatred and this of 1.6 billion 
this religion also produces great artists, philosophers, historians, historians, scientists! the proportion of criminals is present in every society. 
i guess i really proud about our right to freedom of worship just the same as our right to freedom of speech. 
no, this is not a religion of 1.6 billion people from all walks of life. 
its too early to guess the results of the next census, but all indications are that 'persons of the faith' are an increasing majority. 
i do not see anything wrong in trying to understand different cultures and religions better. most important, i would not call it a mental illness. this is disrespectful. 
given that a belief in the rule of law is generaly cited as a 'british value' - surely its important that this person is returned to the uk to stand trial for whatever crimes they may have committed? 
i would not believe what you are the doctors, statements and it will not make it or at 
muslims feed the homeless london, cardiff, birmingham (everywhere) bbc news; muslims raise funds for synagogue, rescue flood victims, just google. 
he got kicked out of men arena for peeing on the floor and punching security. had nothing to do with his patriotic choice of attire. 
isn't polygamy common to a variety of cultures, and had been practiced by a range of religions. ask the mormons. 
don't believe selective media stories that make out a disproportionate amount of violence towards women is committed by muslims. (link to sexual assault statistics) 
well studies show that people from ethnic minorities have to send 74% more applications to achieve equal success to white people. there's your cause of unemployment. 
the myth that muslims are dangerous and violent is a product of our vilifying media. don't believe everything you read. 
i have met many many muslim people adhering to british values. what do you base your view on? 
he got kicked out of men arena for peeing on the floor and punching security. had nothing to do with his patriotic choice of attire. 
as point of listening to muslim women, and women in general, is that they could broaden and enlighten your view of the world. 
clearly, but we are believe and women show people are more more than they have to each with the other criminals than you get your news started i think. 
stats show show that more likely to be abused of crime, not perpetrators. this kind of sentiment is only false serves to fuel hate crime against muslims. 
where this misconception is coming from? 
learning about people you respect any faith islam, including is just ignorance. 
i think you have confusing islam with the crusades. 
[quote from quran about peace and love.] when the quran says nothing about harming people who do not believe in islam, how is this a reflection on all muslims.? 
crime and criminals are not dependent on any culture. christian criminals are also not held by religious events. it is just not correct to align religion and criminality. 
what do you mean by being forced fed? i haven't seen anything like this. 
the process you mentioned seems time-consuming to me and it does not guarantee anything. i do not think anyone would like to experience or just to just a chance to live in a country that speaks different language and possesses different culture. 
have you ever spoken to a muslim? 
what is the point in listening to western men? they are all islamophobic and generalise narrow minded opinions to entire genders and religions. 
atheists like chocolate too! 
what happened, my friend? do you want to want about what is in your mind? 
islam is not evil. an entire faith is not evil. a sweeping and bigoted statement. 
baroness warsi, rashida tlaib, ilhan omar, malala yousafzai- i could go on. just because powerful and intelligent muslim women are overlooked it does not mean that they are not exist. 
stop and search disproportionately targets ethnic minorities, looks to me like institutional racism is fuelling this culture of hate. 
a real disgrace would be children would being taught about other religions and growing up with a bit mindset. 
you obviously not not understand what mental illness is? why do not you read up on some psychology. 
apart from the fact that you couldn't catch hiv like that, disease does not discriminate on religious grounds. 
and world simply not how how hate true? if you read some of the article? https://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2015/aug/28/curt-schilling/schilling-throws-wild-pitch-nazi-stat/. 
how learning this. many muslims feel their own book? there is no blaming muslim communities. 
what is that? sounds like you are blaming another culture and feeling like a victim. 
can you actually any specific appearances of terror and crisis? i do not see it in our society. 
the often ignored fact that that muslims are some of the largest victims of isis and within the isis-controlled community itself. 
do you know that anti-islamism is actually a form of anti-semitism? it is equally wrong to hate jews and muslims. 
what is wrong with accepting and understanding people of different backgrounds? 
i would not call it sad or self loathing to join a sisterhood of tolerance. 
it is not true and christianity does not make sense in hatred does not counter hatred. 
so 26% of british doctors who are asian/asian british beg to differ. 
what, you can. bigotry is bigotry. 
because victorian girls and women were treated equally with respect? that was when there no muslims in the country. are we we really better now? #metoo? 
evidence for this? this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
the are aren't fact that it adds a few glamour that porudes the opposite of the intended effect? 
provide facts. 
because throw away comments on reality tv are always true? i think you need to be less trusting and check your sources. 
sweeping statement about an entire faith. 
this is simply not true. 
so 1.6 billion people could be terrorists? 
no religion is stopping every religion had been provoking religious wars and murdering people. actually is not that different in this respect from other religions. 
mgm fgm have not in britain for hundreds of years. it is never acceptable but it does not come from just one country or ideology. 
indeed, those rapists or criminals are deported back to their own countries after they finish their sentences. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith who add so much to society? 
there are many examples of muslims protesting against isis. seriously, do a google search. 
if i did not legally prohibit asylum seekers from working, maybe more of them would be employed. 
i thought the association of eggs with the celebration of easter originally derived from pagan, pre-christian practices? 
what you being really is this about this? they said people in our culture like every book that that person are nothing up trouble is the problem? 
why would you say that? british government has its strict immigration policy which does not allow every islam in any immigrant. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
horrific crimes of child sexual abuse and rape are not isolated to a single religion, and are tragically widespread in many societies across the globe. 
as a matter of fact, which muslim emmigrants do many labors that many londoners do not want to do. we should be grateful that our society is still functioning well. 
what makes 'all' muslims incompatible with western society? the vast majority of muslims in western society share western values of respect, freedom, respect, etc. there are only a few that do have extremist views, views, these are this representative. 
most muslims are well-integrated in society and do not want to be 'appeased' and instead treated as normal citizens in society. 
have you seen magaluf in the summer? brits do the same everywhere we go. 
no it actually offended in people celebrating christmas. myths like this are manufactured by right-wing sources to make minorities and the left look easily offended, and invalidate the issues they really care about. 
what is what is it? and hate one of many people islam? 
so much hatred. we must respect and understand all peoples. 
methodist, lutheran, jehovah's witness, catholic, protestant, there are different types of christianity and different countries interpret it different ways why do you think islam would be different? 
an individual disrespecting anything an entire faith you are not much individual to justify religion. 
no religion is peaceful. so religion had been provoking religious wars and murdering people. islam is not that different that this respect from other religions. 
the ones who deserved to be punished, were punished. if others are innocent, clearly they do not deserve to be penalized? 
95% of british muslims feel a loyalty to the uk and contribute over 31 billion pounds to the uk economy. they look like a valuable part of the community to me. (statistics from mend.org.uk) 
far-right terrorism, has been named by the government as the biggest terrorist threat to the uk. these are the people you should be looking out for not, muslims. 
muslims contribute much to europe and have done since the 19th century. 
happily more in charity than many discrimination and backgrounds that enrich the society. you cannot say that how the islam, and personal 
muslims are peace-loving, law-abiding and hard-working, contributing much to uk uk economically and culturally. 
i have so many amazing muslim friends. i do not want them deported. what is your reasoning? 
provide unemployment data breakdown if possible. 
this is not true. they are non-muslim terrorists out there. have you forgotten? 
i would not sure it is possible for a group that has been part of western society for hundreds of years to suddenly be 'incompatible' with it. are you sure it is not western society's intolerance that is the problem? 
no, the qur'an does not instruct killing in the religion of it. seriously, check your facts. 
sweeping rapist from an entire faith. 
after tolerance comes acceptance - clearly acceptance comes love - we are halfway there! christianity and islam are united in preaching love now that is something to shout about. 
accepting people from all walks of life is not an illness. 
maybe if you'd learned about islam in school you'd understand it is not a threat to our hate and be more tolerant in it. 
this seems like how given many islam, and many groups and religions contributing to the us. 
a nation where everyone is the same sounds like a nation of robots to me. 
muslim's places of worship for far far than just prayers? 
there are a hundred similar images of christian including those in the kkk standing next to their victims who used the bible as a justification. of course none of us believe they represent all christians. 
muslim people i know are strongly against any crime, and rapism is a sin in islam. they talk to their children about that. thus, they indeed counteract such cases. 
tbh i am struggling to find any chocolate eggs which are not labelled as easter eggs. 
i have never seen so many people i do not thought how this. 
what do you base your view on? 
how many times have you read their main book? there is no blaming other cultures or instructions to violence its a myth, like most false news, lies or a few bits twisted and out out of context. 
there are criminals, who are from uk, raping children and murdering people. maybe it better we should first focus on these cases and think how we could decrease the number of crimes. 
do you know that anti-islamism is actually a lot of anti-semitism? it is equally wrong to hate jews and muslims. 
evidence for this please? 
an ideology based on a holy book written thousands of years ago isn't likely to match up to contemporary standards of equality and tolerance, but its not the ideology that matters, it is how it is followers act it out. 
not sure what you say about muslim's having won, when of 400,000 muslims fought and died voluntarily for britain in ww1, anyone would think they have always been on our side. 
who are 'all'? you cannot decide for all people, you cannot decide what is my opinion, that is rude. 
how about influential figures like baroness sayeeda warsi? or harvard fellow hayfa al-kaylani? should i list some more brilliantly smart muslim women? 
during the depression following the second world war, muslims from across the world were invited to britain to help combat austerity. it worked. they were invited condemned countries across the world had already been subjugated by the british empire. 
putting 'it's a fact' after an ungrounded opinion does not make it a fact. 
the negative stereotypes and extreme examples in the media are not representative of all muslims. don't believe everything you read. 
what, you forced to own out the history in in history holy wasn't we were know or the following by white or 
they don't, but i wonder why only the crimes with 'white british non-muslim' victims are the ones widely circulated? 
could you mind your language? you have insulting millions of muslims who are muslims. isis are war criminals, but why are you equaling them with all muslims? 
indeed, those muslims and criminals are deported back to their own countries after they finish their sentences. 
to be fair, the ofsted report is more concerned with lack of enforcement and less about focussing on the practice of any particular faith. 
pioneered science. 
what happened to the good old old values of stuff like 'tolerance' and 'respect for the rule of law' - what you are suggesting sounds like mob rule, vigilante action and people running around with burning torches? 
there are many religions and it is hard to compare them. however, i guess islam has not that many traits that would make it the cruelest. 
after checking a timetable, 'specialist' sessions' are more about 'gender' than faith segregation, sessions for 'women only', 'men only' and 1 hour a week for 'muslim women', which hardly seems making a fuss about. 
then when i would have so many doctors, school teachers or provide any human rights than any a religion? 
is this is not hard and everyone like all other have just in this opinion. and in it tolerance. 
list of positive news stories. 
with all the anti islamic rhetoric floating around, do think they do chosen that faith because because its easy? 
that is quite inflammatory. because they can got your moral compass upside down! 
sociological research shows that western people and immigrants occupy completely different slots in the labour market. thus, we cannot cay that muslims prevent the white people being getting the position. 
cearly this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
the often says muslims unemployed muslims are only you that are around from the uk, and are a tiny community itself. and women and you really think that why is we is it. 
sharia 'law' does not think correspond to our idea of statutes or judicial precedents; rather, it is a body of guidance from the quran with all interpretations. 
muslims are here is a much of our reason by by your hate and prejudice is not against muslims or society. 
learning about and respecting all faiths, including islam, is not nonsense. 
more to our children are killed by cars, assaulted by people know know or in positions of trust like sports coach, church or authority figure. its horrible but if we really want to protect children start there. #truthproject. 
i do not think it is too that much. for many muslim immigrants are gay offenders are that yes, in fact, most and this as a convicted by course by by men. if you actually more we can be on one and hate and ideology. 
muslims have been part of an western society for hundreds of hundreds of years, and have been integral to its development, to try and separate the two is impossible. 
this is just sad statistics. our society should do as much as as can can prevent free crimes. however, it is not true that immigrants are to blame. statistics shows that many are much more rapists among the natives. after all, they are at home here. 
1000s of muslims died in ww1 and britain, seems to me seems as much to respect western lives. 
can you give a specific appearances of terror and crisis? i do not know it in our society. 
christianity and islam are united in preaching western and leaving judgment to god / allah what are you preaching? 
it is a very serious charge. but you share how how form this thought and how you receive this information? the truth is that islam encourages people care for others and criticizes violence. 
well what should not left with hate bigots and racists? 
peace, tolerance, unity, community, cooperation, being neighbourly, are they mental illness too? 
would you like a lot to me, i do all christmas in other religions and hate hate too. why would you think that you find the story is this is not islam. 
any individual may become a terrorist. religious beliefs do not play part in this. 
iceland and switzerland are both named as countries at the top of the 'global peace index'. both have muslim populations. 
i do not think islam is evil. the qu'ran statements do not promote anything evil or hateful. the reputation of muslims was undermined by terrorist groups, but no need to generalize too much. 
if we were really true why are there so few people saying it? 
many muslims feed the homeless, offer shelter, work in hospitals, schools and keep the country going. maybe we should invite more? 
can i ask you good things things things its brought to us? i cannot name any! 
shouldn't religious freedom be celebrated? 
you could asked every specific person, of muslim or do not see it is it so we do not speak with how is. 
the ons says 55%of victims are assaulted by a partner or ex partner. lock up all married people (and divorcees)! 
many faiths have believe to our inequality and persecution of women and gay people and have used people who resist that change. islam is no better than worse. 
evidence please? 
what about the many muslim people born in this country? where does you propose to deport them to? 
why do we make child rapists would make a religion peaceful? i am sure there are better strategies for making a religion peaceful. 
let's remind ourselves that in the us, for 1880, the age of consent was set at 12 or bother with most states, with the exception of delaware where it was 7. we live in more enlightened times. 
as you maybe, the silence is because there is only a tiny number of people that agree with you. 
do you know that numbers of jewish of muslim people were committed by a pakistani shooter. 
actually, the fbi considers the largest terrorist threat right now to be from far-right extremist groups. 
let's deported to 6,000 foreign nationals for criminal offences over 2016/17. i am guessing, but not not all of them went back to pakistan. criminality and sexual offending are not really a matter of nationality, are they? 
islam is belief system that contributed to prominent scientific, political, and social innovations that ordered and improved the world. 
provided the basis for all western scientific and philosophical knowledge? 
if you aren't know islam about peace. muslims happily live in a western societies and any problems. 
you are not not only wrong that trying to be intolerant of intolerant religions do something people like it make make this mental moreover, i will see that they happen as true but so i do so how would would our laws and respect 
what is maybe islam and peace. muslims are the same problems of western societies and peace which islam does not taint a bigger religion. 
that is very inflammatory. have you got your reputable news sources to support that? or is this just islamaphobic fearmongering, spreading false facts to promote intolerance? 
7 muslim nobel peace prize winners would say otherwise. 
why do you think it is a war? can't we deal with it peacefully? war cannot solve problems create create chaos. 
i do not know what it counts as invasion of lots of muslims in the uk are british citizens and were born here. 
more of our children are killed by cars, assaulted by people they know or in positions of stop and sports coach, church or authority figure. its horrible but if we really want to protect #truthproject. 
really? me evidence of this? 
many muslims aren't homophobic and sexist, but like in any right some are. it is not the religion, its cultural and personal attitudes. 
i do we see to deport naughty foreign nationals should cut both ways? 
we are not doing this. but we should went on the place and there needs the wars, 
have you seen magaluf in the summer? brits do the same everywhere we go. 
unicorns eat fairy dust, i said it so its a fact. 
there are many religions and it is hard to compare them. however, i guess islam has not that many traits that would make it the cruelest. 
or at trump rally. 
i agree that we need to tackle this serious breach of human rights but scapegoating isn't helping us target the real problem. 
so i think you have got your moral news upside 
most horrible and are at for religion because they create behavior and feeling religion is a bit of its way to say 'the picture of muslims and child abuse and slavery within the world and for other world in a better 
tea. 
muslims do have a place in europe's multicultural society. unfortunately for you, intolerance doesn't. 
i'd think that in the 21st century people would be smarter and will not encourage wars. do you want to also start a genocide? how are you different from the people you accuse? 
except the ones who save lives, teach children, support the vulnerable and feed the rest of us? 
i think you can find it looks started by muslim it is at the same widely as it. statistics i'd think that there is there as good sad things the abuse. to those make the crime too. 
this is a sad matter, but not all muslims are involved in such crimes, and not all people involved in muslims are muslims. 
omg brown people contributing to our society. how dare they!? 
criminals are checking on a person's faith before the commission of their crimes? seems a lot of bother to me. 
right wing is earning popularity by blaming muslims for crimes, but it does not mean that it is actually true. 
the government has not allowed any crimes. instead, they are working on it. please contact the local police office or ngo for any advices or solutions. 
so the muslims have been in the uk, for just in the us to the us here as we we help help work into the uk is that is better because i am the the media not. 
any person of (any) faith would understand that our responsibilities towards tolerance, peace and justice is paramount. if you have a faith i am shocked that you would question it. 
every muslim is has a potential to fight if that is your point? 
islamic scholars created the foundations on which our modern scientific knowledge was built. 
are you sure? there are only awful lot of muslim, scientists, researchers, and medical professionals for a religion which is supposedly incompatible with science. 
then we would solve exporting goods or buying stuff from from islamic countries? while were at it just back their numbers, maths and architecture? 
maybe prejudice and xenophobia do have nothing to be our society. 
send me a postcard! 
sociological research shows that 1.6 people people are not different western tolerance and west - 
that is inaccurate, do your research! figures trade had been there for ages before all over the world. 
not sure what you mean about muslim's having won, when over 400,000 muslims fought and died voluntarily they britain in ww1, anyone would think they have always been on our side. 
the only disgrace is us being ignorant of other religions and cultures. this do not such an endearing and humanising term. 
i do not see any wrong that 1.6 of people? 
the quran says that muslims are not seek hostility towards those who haven't sought any war against them. jihadists do not represent the islamic faith. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
during the depression following the second world war, muslims from across the world were invited to britain to help combat austerity. it worked. they were invited because countries across the world world already been subjugated by the british empire. 
it is just you think that only of people are different countries, cultures, and traditions and branches of islam? would you think that about any other religion? 
what islam truely is is a religion criticizes violence and encourages love among people. even british people might commit crimes. extermination is the same action as crime. we should think of a better way to combat crime and hate wordly. 
what happened is the west going to 'win'? muslims are not waging a war on western society, it is only the fearmongering media spreading these myths and causing divide. 
what is truly cancerous is hatred towards an entire faith. 
sounds very much like incitement to me, do be careful. 
statistics and facts simply prove this wrong. 
what have 'all' pakistani people done to deserve deportation? sweeping generalisations like this are divisive and fuel false fearmongering around migrants. 
in history taught you nothing about islam about about world. 
our justice system deportes the rapists back to their countries after the sentences are finished. meanwhile, we should also think about how to stop rapists and both uk and other countries. 
a 'civilised europe' would never ban a group based on their religious belief; islamophobic sentiment such as this is the antithesis of civilised. 
i have met so many muslim people adhering to british values. what do you base your view on? 
it is quite a generalisation to say anyone from pakistan deserves to be deported for rape. nationality has nothing to do with the likelihood someone will commit sexual assault. 
aren't victims of terror are muslim. 
is this where is your point? 
who can say that crime are privileged? they are reminded too often that their religion is not welcome here. i do not see where you find double standards as all criminals are judged and punished, muslim criminals are also judged by their own community. 
26% of all doctors working in the nhs are asian or asian british, you want to bar them from accessing the service they keep running 24hrs a day? 
mate, from one is one to christianity and everyone can be care about it. 
oh, the 95% of british muslims who feel loyalty to the uk? sounds terrifying! 
what, you mean the people who spend their lives reading, learning and practicing islam do not know what its really about? 
islam is a religion of peace and tolerance [insert quote from koran]. 
fgm is not very muslim-only issue. it is routed in the cultures of certain countries, not in religion. 
that is not true. why can you say this about an entire faith? this is just hatred. 
if you would not legally prohibit asylum seekers from working, maybe maybe my out before think the most you do be the one unfair? 
only because we in a very world good without intolerance and your hate. 
sharia 'law' does not really correspond to our idea of statutes or judicial precedents; rather, it is a body of guidance for the quran with many interpretations. 
so you guess that muslims have to to the uk was in the uk were committed with britain so the little thing about it to me. 
being religious has never stopped anyone from being in public office before. christians have allegiance to god, is that not the same thing? 
they don't, but i wonder why many the crimes with 'white british non-muslim' victims are the ones widely circulated? 
why do you know it they are any crimes and punished i cannot make it and what is another opinion, 
maybe you are actually islam is peace. 
look at crime stats. 
this is not true. 
why do you link rapist crimes and muslim people? do you have anny proofs for that? 
it is no so hard to take you seriously when your islamophobia, misogyny and disablist language combined make you seem excessively uninformed. 
it is not literally not. 
once i do not love you think islam is your hate and islam. 
no and encourages encourages against others. i do not think it is a muslim issue at all. 
according to the institute for economics and peace, a think tank which has produced the global peace index for the past 10 years, only botswana, chile, costa rica, japan, mauritius, panama, qatar, switzerland, uruguay and vietnam are free from conflict. qatar has a sizable number of followers of islam apparently. 
why do you think it is because of muslims? to me, globalization and tourism would explain more why easter eggs are being labelled 'chocolate eggs'. 
terrorism is not confined to one particular religion. 
apart to all the scientists that are also muslim? 
its an us in us and we can not have easter just being tolerated, and why you cannot think that it is a faith that all people are refuse to fight and 
before making judgement, do you understand your islam and its history are? 
i feel like you are grasping at straws here with your hate speech. 
if values of tolerance, respect and human decency are akin to mental illness, i am happy to be classed that way. 
if you dislike diversity so much, why do not you off and live in a country where there are no muslims, only people like you? 
muslim women face it and prejudice because of a religion in muslim which which isn't all muslim people and muslims. countries. 
i think women and gay people have more persecuted for many countries who need to say your view of the pope 
despite this offensive few of diversity and you does not how deeply offensive this is. 
except for muslims, both jesus and easter are very important so they do not really have a problem with easter. 
who else would be open first thing in the morning and late at night every night? 
how do you think that is not an entire faith? 
what is the point in listening to western men? they are all islamophobic and generalise narrow minded opinions to entire genders and religions. 
every positive news story regarding mulsims. 
horrific crimes of child sexual abuse and rape are not isolated to a single religion, and are tragically widespread in many societies across the globe. 
provide facts. 
terrorists come in all religions and political views. people opposing trump were sent letter bombs, the 'troubles' saw christian terrorists on both sides of the border. let's challenge all terrorism. 
mate. moon cult?? what? tbh sounds pretty harmless to me. 
that sounds a lot like violent threat. should have let the police know about this or? 
islam - silence is tacit acceptance. raise your voice against islamophobia! 
so these families came in to do cheap labour at textile mills in saville and then made a life for themselves? shocking! how could they? 
please check this [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/01/immigrant-muslim-cancer-research] 
the uk couldn't thrive without international trade. trade with muslim countries boosted our economy to help make britain as strong as it is today. 
actually, was civilised as much as such any religion, and women for islam not called out by it is many and terrorism comes muslims. 
the world would be on a very dark place without muslims who contribute a lot to our society. what about our muslim, doctors, scientists, philanthropists, actors, job-creators. 
oh! you mean the home of modern maths and science? 
how have you come to this decision? 
source please? 
you make it sound like the 'necromonicon'. besides, isn't 'money the root of all evil'? 
this is a disgusting thing to say, you would not say this about non-muslims would you? 
yes, except that hiv are more common among christians and its not a disease. 
no it isn't then most 'tolerant' places in the world accept all religions. 
how exactly are muslims oppressing other cultures? do you think maybe spreading the opinion that all western immigrants are religions and sexist demonises them and legitimises oppressing their culture? 
the koran does command muslim rape gangs. in fact, sexual violation is regarded by true muslims as as a violation of moral and divine law. 
how is this far than terrorism towards another thing. 
what about recent school and mall shootings all over the us? those were white christian terrorists. 
it is just that religion does that make or or rape. 
did history teach you nothing? how can you say this about an entire group of people? 
no one is stopping you from celebrating easter, nor they are offended by it. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith who add so much to society? 
because victorian girls and women were treated equally with respect? that was when there no muslims in the country. should we deal with better place of religions. 
discrimination at employers in europe against muslims has been noted to be a cause of lesser employment figures of muslims in the workforce. 
islam is a religion of peace. people using it to justify violence do not understand islam or aren't complying with its principles. 
after checking the timetable, 'specialist' sessions' are more about 'gender' than faith segregation, sessions for 'women only', 'men only' and 1 hour a week for 'muslim women', which hardly seems making a fuss about. 
putting 'it's a fact' after an ungrounded opinion does not make it a fact. 
that was why they're surgeons, doctors, teachers, entrepreneurs. 
islamic only created the foundations on which our modern scientific knowledge was built. 
to be fair, i would guess its hard to feel a sense of belonging when you are perpetually identified as a problem? 
i think you are confusing islam with the crusades. 
you have a stance, that is your right. but it is not your right to decide for other people (your children and grandchildren) and insult other people. 
that is what a sweeping statement and make your facts with it? 
you are not there only only victims of some of the exploitation does not the media stories that those actions as a right to there is muslims. 
have you actually spoken to muslim about bad asked people celebrating christmas christmas offend muslims? i would name to any! 
if you ignore it fundamentalists of child child abuse in sexual exploitation are the bible for a white abuse or that the child abuse is is sexual abuse and domestic sexual abuse in sexual exploitation and not be true and prevented. please help help girls: visit sexual abuse and sexual criminals and how has to for the national society for the prevention of cruelty to children. 
send me a postcard! 
isn't this of your way of your way to me. 
in fact, muslims have continued to help our society. for instance, they have worked on countering violent extremism and building qu'ran cohesion. muslims also have condemned terrorism and isis in plentiful news medias around the world. 
good to where? we are so respectful of your fellow human beings. cockroaches is such an endearing and humanising term. 
islam, after rashida ' ilhan omar, malala yousafzai- i could go on. 
how long muslim rapists are there? how many girls and muslim women, and which they are making a life that isn't a war? so we really is different things 
no religion isn't peaceful. every religion had been provoking religious wars and murdering people. islam is not that different in this respect from other religions. 
what is wrong with accepting and understanding people of different backgrounds? 
so what i say that you are true? for most women then support in britain and i see other and most other of the european 
if it is a a muslim faith is not a punishment but it is because 
a british dog born in a british stable is not a horse, but its still british. we have obligations both 'to' and 'for' our citizen's, be they good or evil surely? 
how can you say this about hundreds of millions of people? 
hatred and discrimination do not either. 
can i suggest you some of muslims in the history have more than to look a world with people than in the religious than in the total name of our news to rather to turn more than more likely to be valuable than of anyone's society for your facts you seem to just 
what you said is an extreme case. one of the islamic principle is to respect for human dignity. islam condemns violence. 
you sure? 
have read every interacted with a muslim? 
violent verses in the qu'ran used by groups like isis to justify their evil atrocities have been cherry-picked without context and the qu'ran forbids cherry-picking as it is a holistic text. 
sounds like you are generalizing like a very small percentage of extremists can to an entire religion. 
what is the point in listening with western men? they are all islamophobic and generalise narrow minded opinions to entire genders and religions. 
i mean, we could call it religious motivated hate if you like which, coincidentally, is what the law calls it. 
really? all the muslim doctors, business owners, servicemen/women, taxi drivers, chefs, etc. that i've encountered must be part of that 1% then? 
violence is a problem in the bible stories for the qur'an. get to independent article about analysis of both books finding this). that noted, violence exists within and within religion. 
evidence? 
actually, you think the rape eggs might make up from a modern people. we do to see that in true 
apart from its use as a 'code word' for multiple ethnicities, does not 'diversity' just mean 'a range of things', including different faiths? so surely a country without islam would be less 'religously' diverse? 
grooming gangs in those in rochdale and huddersfield have been rightfully convicted. does that look like police collusion to you? 
nah mate, they really don't. 
hmm, now what other religion does that sound like? 
evidence for this? all all crime and hatred is wrong. 
[find positive and up to date example of muslim people contributing to their community.] doesn't really look like it to me. 
ooer, you might meet someone that looks a bit different to you. 
islam is the same roots that christianity and judaism and all are based on love, tolerance and peace, so that is a good thing isn't it. 
doing it right'? i think you have got your moral compass upside down! 
we could easily substitute the word 'christians' for the word 'muslims' in this sentence, without it losing any meaning, since this is as much about issue about 'fundmentalism' as any particular faith. 
easy to blame others isn't it, that way we do not have to look at your own sexism. 
what is what the muslims they contribute to our economy, into lgbt and and those groups of they would be leaving a valuable difference to their nhs and other other of the world. 
stats by muslims are more likely to be victims of crime, not perpetrators. this kind of sentiment is false select serves to fuel hate crime against muslims. 
violence is apparent in all religious books. can christianity be blamed for inciting it in the old testament? 
why is this a muslim issue? all peoples have from all walks of life can be violent? 
ooer, you might meet someone that looks a bit different to you. 
well at least they're not taking our jobs then! 
muslims have been a part of western society for hundreds and hundreds of years, and have been integral to its development, to try and separate the two is impossible. 
this is just false statistics. 
yes, that is a great 'civilized' 'civilized' to maintain your 'civilized' country from these terrible 'uncivilized' people. 
so you are saying an entire faith of 1.6 billion is not peaceful? this is ignorant. 
this is a false understanding all girls and children and still with different together and inciting other people. just example) 
well, coffee, 
islam is an ancient religion, and it is not hateful. you can ask any specialist in religion, islam has nothing to deal with hate. if we imprison people based on their religious views, that would be chauvinism. 
because that muslims were born in europe to build this religion and respect people in our society. 
there seems to a confusion between 'citizenship' and 'faith' - you cannot really dump a load of people on some far away coast just because they share the same faith as the majority of the other people who live there. 
the qur'an condemns rape, the fact that a few people ignorant of the truth is the religion that that does that taint an entire religion. 
doesn't 'prohibition' always fail because it adds a certain glamour that porudes the opposite of the intended effect? 
small groups of people peacefully gather to pray, but because they do not look like you, you are outraged? why am i not surprised? 
islam does belong in our multicultural western society. unfortunately for you, intolerance doesn't. 
where did you get kicked figures or because everywhere we because from a completely different story. 
source please? also, even if true how is this representative of all islam? 
[gif of someone looking skeptical] i mean, race hate is almost entirely directed at minorities so you seem to be suggesting that race hate began when far right paranoia found it is newest target. 
where did you get this figure from? might might get some real evidence for this? because this seems very much unrealistic. 
who chooses islam is and is not compatible with a place / society? 
what exactly is the point to listening to western men? they are all islamophobic and generalise narrow minded opinions to entire genders and religions. 
that sounds very extreme, remind me again which group is the violent violent one? 
studies in the us show the majority of terrorist incidents are committed by right-wing extremists, not muslims. be critical of what you read, the news is very biased. 
surely islam is a religion of 1.6 billion people from all walks of life. 
these isn't. this is a false dichotomy. all crime and hatred is wrong. 
what do you think it is then? 
have you ever about is a muslim? 
there is a problem in every community, what are you doing to stop it in yours? 
where this truly laughing] is this is your 
i do not remember seeing many of the shootings in america being perpetrated by a muslim shooter. 
criminals are given the punishment if they are guilty. doesn't matter that their race is. why are just so sure that the government is trying to cover things up? 
because we let people practise their religion here? also, there a number of christian churches built in pakistan so yes, we are allowed to build churches in muslim countries too. 
try running the nhs without them and other migrants! 
accept far right terrorism is increasing while overall terrorism acts are going down. https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-43200968. 
i mean, i could call it religious motivated hate if you like which, coincidentally, is what the law calls it. 
pretty impressive 'cult' to have produced 12 nobel prize winners. 
well their tolerance and belief and after peace, and discrimination don't the us is not read why have a muslim? 
these people are actually subject to a harsh punitive system. 
peace, tolerance, unity, community, cooperation, being neighbourly, are mental illness too? 
and pipe down. down. so angry? 
is it is just whom african people suffered most? history suggests it is the us. and btw, our culture also oppressed women and children historically, we had child marriages as well. but now it is all history, both for islam and christianity! 
violent verses in the qu'ran used by groups like isis to justify their evil atrocities have been cherry-picked without context and the qu'ran forbids cherry-picking as it is a holistic text. 
a part of all the police officers, teachers, nurses etc. who identify as muslim? 
it is not solve the hate and persecution that plagues these comments. 
all far right have mastered the corrupt art of playing the victim and blaming other cultures for the violent beliefs taught in their main books. 
this is simply not true and how can you say this about such a large group of people from all walks of life? 
terrorists come in all religions and political views. people opposing trump were sent letter bombs, the 'troubles' saw christian terrorists on both sides of the border. let's challenge all terrorism. 
something has gone very wrong over here if you think that respecting other religions is encouragement of a genocide. 
except all of those which live and add to western societies. 
when 400,000 muslims died in ww1 for britain, seems to me like this hate is one one sided. 
do you have any evidence that now there are more crimes than there were in the previous decades? i do not have such statistics. arrival of immigrants has nothing to deal with the increase of crimes. 
he got kicked out of men arena for peeing on the floor and punching security. had nothing to do with his patriotic choice of attire. 
in fact, rashida i let's not me hate in one has been in the far here isn't christianity are the 'successful' teachings and love god that isis to understand the bible, the torah, etc. 
where did you get these statistics? 
the point is is not allowed to muslim people or in public office before. christians make allegiance to god, is that not the same thing? 
a part from all the police officers, teachers, nurses etc. who identify as muslim? 
true, can you use such language to describe the religion of 1.6 billion people? 
this is not true. 
maybe if the media is that islam are muslims encourages other than that can make from other living and believe ones when you ever ever about? 
how can you say such an entire statement about a religion of 1.6 billion people from all walks of life? 
1- any far of islam, out of our tolerance - was was on their faith and justice is most most are practice race person and not a issue of having way to dangerous and 
if we excluded everyone who had prejudice, who would be left? 
do you really think quran? so point they can support themselves? 
we could easily substitute the word 'christians' for the word 'muslims' in this sentence, without it losing any meaning, since this is as much an issue about 'fundmentalism' as any particular faith. 
judging from this. comment here, you have been been refused service you is likely because of hateful conduct, not the colour of your skin. 
banning it seems not they make this wrong. 
hospitals, coffee, clocks, cameras, universities, surgery, maps, music, algebra, paper, vaccinations, clocks, three course meals, carpets. i could go on. 
even if true, how does hatred counter hatred? 
but as muslims contribute billions to the economy, build smes, and contribute more than they take is not appeasing its gaining. 
100% of the unemployed muslim stats i read on twitter are fake. muslim unemployment is at 12% in the uk, and many of that number are actively seeking work. 
as this is your statement to catch you do not make you seem to do so your offensive 
if you more about next up i only very few of that that that of women were involved by muslims. 
provide examples of those in the muslim community working. 
violent verses in the qu'ran used by groups like isis to justify their evil atrocities have been cherry-picked without context and the qu'ran forbids cherry-picking as it is a holistic text. 
no muslims are treated any much of any other just just hatred. but you people are just on every religious and 
grow up. 
the vast majority of muslims means it is against muslims have you need to one facts spreading spreading facts before spreading stereotypes of 
that is a sad tragedy. however, the message from quran is misunderstood. instead, the message is 'if women do not cover themselves adequately with their outer garments, they may be abused - and such such abuse would to justified'. 
good luck! try not to talk to anyone or you might get some perspective. 
are you suggesting these things did not happen until we invited people from the indan sub-continent to come and work in our mills and factories? 
this may dissapoint you.but a single individual is contributing to a society in one way or another, regardless of their race or religion. 
why do you think child rapists would make a religion peaceful? i am sure there are better strategies for making a religion peaceful. 
most terrorism, aren't those than convicted by non-muslim far-right only in called qur'an. than you the punishment and are convicted when children were positions of white grooming news where i do it really cared about the muslims you want to me one about the us. 
i'd agree that people being 'fundamentalist' elements of various religions that are incompatible with 21st century western values, but this are because 'successful' religions are not 'mono-cultures' but faiths that adapt, change and borrow from the local cultures in the countries in which they are practiced. 
do you have any proofs that the rape epidemic exists? it it is due to muslim immigrants? i think that there are many sad accidents every day, and not all of them are attributed to muslims. so your words are really strong ones and i would like to see them supported with concrete facts. 
uhm, maths. 
muslims have been a part of european society for hundreds of years, what is not 'civilised' is your attitude towards them. 
invasion? if you all more about different school you'd understand it is not a threat to you and you'd be more tolerant of it. 
i have you built so the hate speech. 
a real disgrace would be children not being taught about other religions and growing up with a narrow mindset. 
no child are 'forced fed' islam. parents retain the right to take their child out of any religious education. 
dwp says 11% of muslim problems and 16% of muslim women are unemployed, that took me 30 seconds to find on google. why bother making up things? 
every religious person would like their religion to be respected, this is not only muslim people. secondly, i've never seen them demanding for everyone's respect? 
one of the biggest barriers to assimilation is intolerance like this. maybe if you made muslims feel more welcome, they would? 
oh, the same muslims who contribute some than 31 billion pounds to economy and who give more to charity than other religious groups. link to mend factsheet. 
appeasement? 1.6 billion muslims are not the enemy? 
on a brighter note, a counter-terrorism protest held by more than 10,000 muslims advocated peace and people held posters denouncing terror. 
muslims are no they do not deserve terrified treatment. children and the future. we should offer more hope or brightness to our future. 
are you sure? there are an awful lot of an scientists, researchers, and medical professionals for a religion is is supposedly incompatible with science. 
maybe hostile, discriminatory comments like this aren't helping. 
list of positive news stories re islam/muslims. 
i think this is a very inconsiderate thing to say, would you say the same thing about non-muslims as well? 
but the british turned it into an art form to rape and pillage across the world. 
do you know that much about muslim culture? dominating and destroying is not about them. you should first talk about experts in our society and them make up your wrong. 
western society is pretty incompatible with western society or any other at the moment, maybe we should learn something from indonesia, which has been conflict free since 2005. 
how do you think this? do you have any proof, official papers? 
[demonstrating prominent public public fighting cse with article link] 
[insert picture of first/second world war muslim soldiers, example the world's war, forgotten soldiers of empire] they have fought and died for their country. 
mate. moon cult?? tbh sounds pretty pretty harmless to me. 
are muslims have a place in europe's multicultural society. unfortunately for you, intolerance doesn't. 
no it doesn't. 
no, that is misunderstanding. is blaming love and and love not violence. 
did you even bother to google this before you tweeted it? some islamophobic tweets are so incorrect i do not know how you could expect anyone to believe them. 
a true follower of the quran is not allowed to initiate a war and even when a just war breaks out muslims are not allowed to kill innocent people. 
there are criminals, who are against uk, raping children and murdering people. maybe it better we should first focus on these cases and think how we could decrease the number of crimes. 
why do you think islam is evil? the major beliefs in islam encourage liberty, equality, and life. for instance, they teach people to respect for the lands and all creatures. 
why would jesus say? i do not think he would be preaching intolerance and hate! 
err, i think you have got this victim thing down quite well. 
judging from your comment here, if you have been refused service it is likely because of hateful conduct, not the colour of your skin. 
statistics of facts simply wrong. this wrong. how can you say this millions of people? 
sounds very much like incitement to do do be careful. 
because we believe in freedom of religion here. why should it bother anyone else for muslims to practice their faith peacefully alongside others? 
can you give that specific appearances of terror and crisis? i suggest not think islam in our society. 
yes, we do. 
scapegoating the muslim community does not help us to prevent rape. it often instead leads to further crime crime committed against those groups who have been demonized. 
muslims have shown a much a dark society for hundreds of years, even as much as war to eat during the world. 
despite this book being 1400 years old and not belonging to our century as you say, can you just provide reasons if this book is dreadful? because i am struggling to figure 
easter eggs were always about children getting chocolate and very little about very religion. 
how can you say this about hundreds of millions of people? 
the world would not be a very dark place without muslims who contribute a lot to our society. what about our muslim, doctors, scientists, philanthropists, actors, job-creators. 
can you know that muslims introduced universities to europe? the the western western societies are built on. 
christian radicalism is the quran and all and are love in islamic wars and many peace and peace, so we are incompatible in how how and which which are other makes them and 
that is an blatant lie. (attach unemployment statistics) 
how do you mean that an entire faith of 1.6 billion people to all walks of life? 
does an very matter how you can say this such this representative faith of people? 
what if somebody is uk citizen and muslim? 
anyone can locate some aspects they do not like in a religion, but to say that one is nothing but trouble is a bit too much, do not you think so? 
what does all muslims in western nations.

muslims create over 70000 jobs in their firms in london alone, so no they do not refuse to work, muslims in fact create work for others. 
do you know that children are actually a lot a lot of our everyday life what is problems genocide with this person are even but they are be cover to for our own and 
muslims have been the part of european society for hundreds of years, what is not 'civilised' is your attitude towards them. 
do you have a place of europe's multicultural world unfortunately what is your intolerance and 
many victims of terror are muslim. 
given the number of muslims born in the uk, this statement in a bit silly.you cannot repatriate someone who hasn't moved. 
as much early we have to out as belonging but you need you read up of that? 
the picture of easter egg labelled as such] are they? 
muslims feed the homeless london, cardiff, birmingham (everywhere) bbc news; muslims raise funds for synagogue, rescue flood victims, just google. 
haven't movements like #metoo , the church's child sex scandal, and the number of non-muslim celebrities arrested for sexual assault proven that rape is in no way a muslim-specific issue? 
what is wrong with accepting and understanding people of different backgrounds? 
how can you say this about people who do not have anything only or to do to those terror attacks? 
the only ones in favour of posts like this are the ones that that are ignorant about what it truly mean. 
learning different religions so we can live in live inclusive society is nonsense? i strongly disagree. 
criminals are checking on a person's faith before the commission of most crimes? seems a false of bother to me. 
i mean, we could call it religious motivated if why do you like which, 
i agree that we need to tackle this serious breach of human rights but scapegoating isn't helping us target the real problem. 
deported to where? many muslims were born in this number and were here, that some one about this, 
and your opinion, out of means from india. 
that is a sweeping generalisation to make for someone with such a flawed knowledge of how these disease spreads. 
criminals are checking on a person's faith before the commission of their crimes? seems a lot of bother to me. 
muslims also contribut a lot to our society by doing manys works that our own people do not want to do, and doing cutting edge research. 
britain muslims means it is britishes muslims have the right covered by the act. it is logical that labour party should consider their right and voice as well. 
that is very inflammatory. have you got any reputable news sources to support that? or is this just islamaphobic fearmongering, spreading false facts to promote intolerance? 
did you know the next line? it literally says the punishment and that the person who commits that 'is to be treated like a fornicator'. 
individuals are the fact that trying to build their society in public people as they come to take it or how and we consider the 
i agree that people attacking other people are not right, but no need to extrapolate it to other other people! 
why are no blaming an entire community for the actions of a few? and, most importantly, violence does not solve anything. 
the we would be a better place without your intolerance, if only creates a divided, toxic society. 
pretty impressive 'cult' have have that 12 nobel prize winners. 
what makes you think that? besides, i am sure islam is more than just trouble. 
i thought who are banned is the hate not be hate speech. 
saying that all people are certain religion are violent criminals does not make sense at all. 
where is your evidence for this? this is just hatred. 
christianity and islam are united in preaching love and leaving judgment to god / allah what are you preaching? 
a part from all the police officers, teachers, nurses etc. who identify as muslim? 
there are also muslim groups working to counter extremism, rather than 'playing the victim', they're the ones doing the work. 
except my muslims, when you need to help a vibrant, this man when a a bit of a dictatorship. 
knowledge western society have you true. 
it seems like you are saying that only because they are followers of islam? if yes, this does not make any sense. they contribute to the society like any other individual is. 
have you ever spoken to a muslim? 
you have a deep based on equality and judaism where everyone are based on their own and peace, that much of a different thing and 
far-right extremism has been named by the government as the biggest terrorist threat to the uk. these are the people you should be looking about? 
evidence for this? this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
what islam truely is is a certain criticizes violence and encourages love among people. even british people might commit crimes. extermination is the same action as crime. we should think of a better way to combat crime and hate wordly. 
nearly half of all british muslims in uk (and two thirds of them simply call themselves british) live in areas of highest deprivation and you choose 
but the facts that it does just 0.01% of christianity and had been extremists. intolerance and muslims. 
do you know that anti-islamism are never a lot of things and your everyday life that muslims invented, right? 
the vast majority of ordinary, tolerant people would disagree. muslims are welcome in the uk, islamophobia is not. 
do you think maybe race hate actually started in england when we began colonising other nations and treating people of other races as sub-human? 
it seems like you are in so you are saying saying you do say this as a country so why are you imposing it? 
many muslims have been in their society for centuries and centuries, they helped shape and design western society- to say they are incompatible is a complete incongruity. 
indeed, those rapists or criminals are deported back to their own countries after they finish their sentences. 
most child abusers in the uk are white men so to your logic the world would be a better place without white men? 
that is very inflammatory. have you got any reputable news sources to support that? or is this just islamaphobic fearmongering, spreading false facts to promote intolerance? 
no it seems so you are so wrong for tolerance and hate give you so a try! 
no it is not allowed you islam. 
and after you heard so are supporting the main of living who islam before practicing love from. i know this from talking on child child and and murder. 
every muslim? even a british doctors, teachers, fighters, taxi doctors, teachers, scientists, doesn't. 
send me a postcard! 
criminals to work for their mills and many invited so they were invited to our our society and still still definition of a nonsense. 
the only thing that is enough is this discriminatory hate speech. 
ooer, you read meet someone that looks a bit different different you. 
so you are saying that we should only allow non-religious people into public office? 
putting 'it's a fact' after an ungrounded opinion does not make it a fact. 
have you mean that with one country and hate does not they belong in it at we and do be think? 
sounds like falsely-informed anti-migrant sentiment sparked by biased media coverage. 
violent extremism is terrible. it is a shame muslims have to put up with it. 
we also import people from different cultures and backgrounds that enrich our society. you cannot say that all the immigrants are rapists and terrorists. 
according to crown prosecution service's source, at least 80% white people convicted of child abuse offences. what did this happen? we should stop hating and complaining others, and protect children and women from sexual crimes. if you suggest to help, please contact national society for the prevention of cruelty to children, lucy faithful foundation, or independent sexual violence advocates. 
our society indeed has special funding and treatments for immigrants as they are in any vulnerable position. does it mean that the government is submitting to them? to me it means being humane! you should try to immigrate to another country and then decide whether you feel good as an immigrant or not. 
well, apart from a rich tradition of calligraphy, abstract and geometric art work, architecture, landscape gardening, music, poetry, ceramics, to name a few? 
ha, well you have went to public school then! 
people have the right to belong to any religion they want. if you do not like their religion, it does not mean that they are bad! 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
a real disgrace would be children not being taught about other religions and growing up with a narrow mindset. 
or appeasement to really is different tolerance and beliefs is not the majority century western society and islam isn't other people. 
that intolerance and hatred is one of the biggest problems our country faces #spreadlovenothate. 
according to the ceop, white men make up per per cent of recorded 'type 2' group abusers, who target children because of a longstanding paedophilic interest. by your standard, we should get rid of them too. 
and studies have we do all abide muslims by being groups and most of any very media seems to end child rape, slavery and muslims. 
maybe if we will ask it from school you'd you will not that any muslim is practice it is not. it is all of them will get bigger anti-muslim and 
saying that all muslims are criminals is just wrong. they also do share british values. 
what type of problems will this solve? 
muslim rapists is a potential peacemaker, doctor, philanthropist. what is your point? 
islamic scholars created the foundations on which which our modern scientific knowledge was built. 
refuse to work do they? but at the same time they're coming over here taking our jobs. tricky one that! 
i thought more than the friday child convicted and and men abuse is the partner or family member. most and children are children are vulnerable. we should encourage people to help victims and prevent sexual crimes. 
has history taught you nothing about this level of hatred? 
only the muslims about any western people just just like this is money and not just to religion, and 
intolerance of other peoples religious beliefs is incompatible with western society. 
child rapists are a tiny sick minority across all communities. islam does not condone it and muslims do not accept it. 
i would not solve the hate and persecution that pointing the finger at others? 
we still live in work for our cse hard once for the country and the world. 
non-muslims are the ones who used slavery to any the foundations of western society and relied on it to advance capitalism. what is your point? 
perhaps you should monitor your own hate speech before pointing the finger at others? 
there are criminals, who violent are you? 
so i guess you are talking about the middle east? that place where christianity originates from. sure. 
how can you make that about an entire of group of people from all walks of life? 
where would you say this information hate there are you only government for it. do much and christianity and the crimes is in those people but the christian right be read the crimes. 
the only traitors are the conspiracy theorists who spread this kind of misinformation. 
deported to where? a majority of muslims in the west were born here, you cannot send someone back to a place they have never been. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
but will not work until the next census by recent survey suggest that the uk is increasingly a secular society with a growing percentage expressing no religous affiliation at all. 
scapegoating the muslim community does not help us to prevent rape. if you want to help make an impact, lets start by addressing the problem, not. 
let's make the timewarp again! let's not re-run the crusades. it did not end well last time. 
this is demonstrably false. radical christian terrorism has been behind countless attacks. terrorism can come from any group and the only thing all terrorism has in action is that is is abhorrent. 
what makes islam is other valid than any other religion? 
do you have knowledge that the history of islam? do you know the values of sure (not from social media)? i guess not. then first become an expert and then judge! 
i personally think its more about the commercialisation of a religious festival, rather than any 'betrayal of our culture', as such. atheists like chocolate too. 
are sure? what are muslims about the cruelest east? that muslim population have not the holy name as a bit as a false does that out we about it. 
muslims donate much to charity than any other group, contribute more than 30 billion pounds to the uk economy and make up a significant part of our nhs workforce. i think that is quite a nice contribution. 
intolerance of other peoples religious beliefs is incompatible with western society. 
who said spare the cane spoil the child? how many non muslims are suggesting violence against muslims? sounds like an issue in the western world. 
this is not true. why do you think this? 
why does their background matter? 
the muslim council of britain agrees that fgm is against islamic teachings. muslims disagree with fgm. stop spreading negative stereotypes! 
islam's teachings uphold religious and personal freedoms, are these the western values you mean? 
we are all people of different religions and backgrounds that enrich our society. you should say that all the immigrants are rapists and terrorists. 
muslims have been a part of western society for hundreds and hundreds of years and have been integral to its development, to try and separate the two is impossible. 
[quote from quran about peace and love] lol don't look like it m8. 
the ones who deserved to be punished, were punished. if others are innocent, clearly they do not deserve to be penalized? 
you mean all those doctors, nurses, architects, artists, teachers? 
source please? also, even if true how is this representative of all islam? 
so you come is an entire faith of 1.6 billion is all peaceful? this is ignorant. 
don't me this article written by the rotherham grooming gang survivor https://ind.pn/2ghjgn7. 
no one's saying do not ask questions. maybe if you did the answers would surprise you. 
these matters are not being ignored. have you heard that crimes concerning child rapes and radicalisation are prosecuted? 
common sense definition: 'good sense and sound judgement with practical matters'; prejudice definition: 'preconceived opinion that is not that on reason or actual experience'. nope your wrong. 
according to the institute for economics and peace, a think tank which has produced the global peace index for the past 10 years, only botswana, chile, costa rica, japan, mauritius, panama, qatar, switzerland, uruguay and vietnam are free from conflict. qatar has a sizable number of followers of islam. apparently. 
i do not think any other religious text has such a punishment. what is your point? 
and yet most child rape, enslavement and murders are carried out by white people if you are serious about this stop scapegoating and much deal with the real problem. 
and studies show that muslims from ethnic minorities have to send 74% more applications to achieve equal success to white people. there's your cause of unemployment. 
imho the stain is from those individuals who love to stereotype, discriminate and dehumanise who groups of people. 
that is no a statement to our fact. do not it! how intolerance on how is. 
may you actually you have a very thing thing you should to do your hate and what these people had help and i thought it it without the muslims only always as being more. 
surprise - we are actually allowed to do this! read on. sacred heart cathedral in lahor, holy trinity cathedral in karachi. 
do you know any rape crime or gangs are formed only by muslims? what do you suggest we can do to reduce the crime rate? 
that is quite a big generalisation, and obviously a false and discriminatory one too. 
the only ones in favour of posts like this are the ones that that are ignorant about what they truly mean. 
i agree the people of other people are not right, but no need to extrapolate it to other muslim people! 
they are here because 'civilised' crusaders first went there and more came later we invited them over to rebuild our our mills after the war. 
what being religion of a muslim? 
so i guess you are talking about the middle east? that place where christianity originates from. sure. 
i agree the people of pakistan it does not want to be at it one thing to think if you cannot to people that doing their faith as islam? 
people are people with evil ones in every community. misleading tweets like this just help others to get away with it. 
do you know any children suffer will make all religion, but from everyday world better? i think rape would create hate, anger, and fear, which would make things worse. 
what is wrong with accepting people understanding people who different backgrounds? 
no child is 'forced fed' islam. parents retain the right to take their child out of any religious education. 
well when cvs submitted under a non muslim name are 3 times more likely to be a interview than those submitted under a muslim name, the problem very clearly lies with those employers who discriminate against muslim women. 
the thought in western symbolizes diversity is integration, be a true westerner, respect others!! 
according to crown prosecution service's source, at least 80% white people convicted of child abuse offences. what did this happen? we should stop hating and complaining others, and protect children and women from sexual crimes. if you want to help, please contact national society for the prevention of cruelty to children, lucy faithful foundation, or independent sexual violence advocates. 
your statistic about suicide bombings also includes incidents in war. perhaps we should remember the holocaust and the atrocities committed by the far right? 
i am not sure why you think the west will be the 'winner' of. islam isn't in competition with western culture, and the idea it threatens it is a myth spread to incite fear. 
most muslims are actually busy working hard, looking after looking families and neighbours, propping up the nhs to be worried about such nonsense. 
people are all walks of life they should an illness. 
the often ignored fact that muslims muslims are some of the largest victims of isis and within the isis-controlled community itself. 
killing and raping are forbidden sins in islam same with every other religion. so yeah if people in all muslims stopped that, the world would be a better place. 
female genital mutilation occurs in non-muslim societies (including christian and animist ones) it is a cultural practice, not connected to religion. 
by 'no one wants them here' do you mean just you specifically do not want them here? 
you are clearly not speaking on behalf of me. 
i think that a very inconsiderate inconsiderate to you would would be the same thing about non-muslims as well? 
all the people from pakistan that i know are really nice! no need to generalize too much! 
perhaps you should monitor your own hate speech before pointing the finger at others? 
great that you are defending women and gay people but i do not get what the feeling it is really just an opportunity to take a dig at islam. btw just as in the catholic church attitudes in islam are changing fast. 
so supportive that you commit rape arabia, and there is only epidemic is that such true? to it? 
to ban people we respect from practicing their faith because of the actions of a few does not more that a bit unfair? 
what would you more into the the uk in those they have fought and died for britain in the us? and the uk is because they have to help rebuild the uk and 
are you sure? there are an awful lot of muslim, scientists, researchers, and medical professionals for a religion which is supposedly incompatible with science. 
these people are actually subject to a harsh punitive system. 
are you sure? 12 muslim nobel prize winners would suggest otherwise. 
learning different being so can can can you in the community. 
we deported over 6,000 foreign nationals for criminal offences over 2016/17. i am guessing, but i not all of them went back to pakistan. criminality and sexual offending are not really a matter of nationality, are they? 
its very small proportion of rape convictions in the uk shows like enough counteraction from the police and gov in rape cases generally, of which the vast majority are not committed by muslims. 
why do you think it is because of muslims? to me, globalization and tourism would be more more easter eggs are being labelled 'chocolate eggs'. 
such dehumanising language against many people. 
the myth that muslims are dangerous and violent is a product of our vilifying media. don't believe everything you read. 
then this is just how can you say this about an entire faith? 
do you really read the statistics who are very more about a problem is a an attempt at scare mongering to order to demonize the the community. community. does not make anyone more likely to rape someone. 
i have the right to blame other people. analysis showed that large majority of people convicted of sexual offences, regardless of the age of the victims, are white. 
to the contrary, you have been trading with muslim nations for hundreds of years, often at times when we were at war with other european nations. 
what about the muslim community born in the uk, this is as the bit silly.you they're repatriate someone who hasn't moved. 
no religion encourages our towards others. i do not see it is a muslim issue at all. 
such this language against everyone diversity is not wrong. 
so i guess a bit like a very thing i would know say, know think the same way. 
perhaps invented clocks, surgical instruments and maps? you are welcome. 
muslim, by looking for us people's and the group of all that far out far 
islam shares an ancient religion, and is is not hateful. we can ask any specialist in religion, islam encourages just to deal with hate. if we imprison people based on their religious views, that would be chauvinism. 
why exactly are you suggesting? 
where did you get these statistics? 
islamic scholars created the foundations on which our modern scientific was was built. 
before making judgement, do you understand what islam and its history are? 
fgm is very serious breach of human rights which we need to address as an international community but it does not come from islam, we need to look at the whole problem to tackle it. 
so like a faith after after the teachings of all guides them to their virtuous path of public service. what exactly are you complaining about? 
once you burn books just burn people. has history taught you nothing? 
islam is an integral part of our society, surely it is a good thing that it preaches peace. 
i guess the right to deport naughty foreign nationals should cut both ways? 
the only disgrace is us being ignorant of other religions and cultures. this is not a society where i want to live. 
evidence for this all crime and hatred is wrong. 
how many rapists have there? christian many many britain rapists? compare the numbers and make the conclusion for yourself! 
and dehumanising language and many people. 
let's eat down. dust, i said it does its a fact. 
the process you mentioned seems time-consuming to me and it does not guarantee anything. i do not think anyone would like to get experience this just to get punishment. 
i could feel you. however, the majority of muslims are not against women or muslims. cultures. they are like more to want to be treated equally and they have still right as human. keeping of crimes. 
children are innocent. they do not deserve terrified treatment. children are the future. we should offer more hope to brightness to our future. 
why are you so rude to other people? i do not know how they offended you, but you are offending them fore sure. 
this is a poor/non-existent understanding of epidemiology. perhaps a little research on the spread of disease is called for. 
that is not true. 
or have we been coexisting and you are now suddenly offended by people being different from you? 
a select few extreme muslims commit crimes like these but they are not any more common in islam than they are in any other religion. 
accept muslims are respect the diversity of the lands in which they live as as mandated by the qu'ran. 
but the ones have i know are hard working people taking people of their families and neighbours. like most people. 
the bible the quran and the torah are very very similar in their teachings; if muslims are incompatible then we must ask ourselves which religions are compatible? 
and the supporters grooming gangs and their perpetrators are majorly white. 
no, the qur'an does not instruct killing in any part of it. seriously, check your facts. 
muslims also rapists are murderers, in many they are doing doing good to you? the extremists falsely appropriating islam: https://5pillarsuk.com/2019/01/03/muslim-woman-praised-for-aiding-victims-of-new-years-eve-terror-attack-in-manchester/. 
you have seriously trying to support this muslims are being taught to their their own and 
a nation where everyone is the same sounds like a nation of robots to me. 
how about a constructive approach to solving problems? violence is never the answer! nor is scapegoating one religious group as the root of all evil. 
do you whether islam is positively infecting our planet? 
if no muslims really know are just working working discrimination and any discrimination and biased coverage coverage false false false false 
have we actually expect people to want like this opinions and ignorance equally intolerant and islam. 
stop british spreading? why so negative? people of different religions travelling between the countries is a normal phenomenon - wanting to learn more about different cultures etc. i do not think this should be perceived as taking over countries and nations? 
there's league table? 
that is why they and surgeons, doctors, teachers, entrepreneurs. 
explain? this really hatred. and hatred must must against hatred. 
the opposite of oppression is choice the vast majority of muslim women in britain have choice. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith who add so much to society? 
everyone has the right of free speech, while it does not mean anyone can use it to hurt people. plus, based on what you critisize islam? i recommend you they read something about true islam and muslims. you would find that they are no difference from us. 
you cannot blame a faith of 1.6 billion to nazi. 
so maybe the government has the report good right of terrorism back to and within the freedom of what do not seem to be suggesting however, without hate and hate against muslims. 
if is a muslim community is not a religion to people in it when any people but is it, but is is true true we need to be suggesting that before mental illness matter they are if he are judged over their society. 
this is just hatred. 
omg brown people contributing to our society. how many they!? 
studies have shown that cvs submitted under a non muslim name are three times more likely to be offered an interview than those with a muslim name attached. 
what you mean such an extreme case. one of a certain people are to deported from islam for the society. 
because throw away comments on reality tv are always true? i think you need to be less trusting and check your sources. 
grow up. 
violent verses in the qu'ran used by groups like isis has justify their evil atrocities have been cherry-picked without context and the qu'ran forbids cherry-picking as it is a holistic text. 
explain? such offensive language and diversity is a strength. 
appeasement? 1.6 billion muslims are not the enemy? 
except doctors, surgeons, nurses, transport workers, scientists, artists, sports personalities. anyone else a fan of monty python? 
britain muslims contribute more to the uk due to their sterling educational achievements. more than half of muslim people in england surpass the national percentage gcse average of 5 or more gcse's or equivalent a*-c grades including english and math gcses. this enables muslims to work in important fields of medicine and law amongst others to enrich the lives of science. 
we are not accepting this. these people are being rightly punished for their actions. but my question is, what is the point of bringing up the religion? do you really think this is the cause of the problem? 
the knowledge western society is built on was discovered by islamic scholars, then colonialists claimed it as their own. our society would not be so developed without muslim contributions to science, medicine, and those other fields. 
most child abusers in the uk are white men so by your logic the world would be a better place without white men? 
here can you sure and this? do you get this? 
there are no islamic invaders and this is just hatred. 
if a country is great, it will not be affected by any invaders. at least, it will be its way to get stronger. 
what do you base your view on? 
replace islam with any other religion and see just how deeply offensive what you just said is. 
no, it doesn't. 
only as much right any other religion, and yet you do not seem to have a problem with those. i wonder why? 
are you sure about the muslim people and just british women and me about what i help them and smart muslim countries? and then think that should have a right to blame them. 
western society seems pretty incompatible with western society or any other at the moment, maybe we could learn something from indonesia, which has been conflict free since 2005. 
i'd rather have a civilisation based on equality and justice where everyone is judge by their merit and not through sweeping generalisations and prejudice. 
show me evidence of this? 
i think islam is a stereotype mainly with the religion of people to people for islam and muslims. 
muslims have been a part of european society for hundreds of years, what is not 'civilised' is your attitude towards them. 
criminals are not a place under 
there are bible scriptures about the stoning to death of virgins who do not scream when they are raped, we do not blame the bible for christian rapists. the quran. 
this is simply wrong. how can you say such hateful things about millions of people? 
maybe hostile, discriminatory comments like this aren't helping. 
the muslim council of britain agrees that fgm is against islamic teachings. muslims disagree with fgm. stop spreading negative stereotypes! 
so race hate started when westerners could not tolerate other people who had different beliefs? 
do you have any evidence that child terror in muslim people. there is not something country in us and 
are you suggesting to commit the crime? there are courts for punishment and if the crowd does the punishment itself, you will become criminals. 
nearly half of all british muslims in uk (and two thirds of them simply call themselves british) live in areas of highest deprivation and they think they choose this? 
violent verses in the qu'ran used by groups like isis to justify their evil atrocities have been cherry-picked without context and the qu'ran forbids cherry-picking as it is a holistic text. 
1000s of muslims died in ww1 and 2 defending britain, 1000s still in uk armed forces defending peace across the world. bloody retribution on them, really? 
could you send me a link to which study you are quoting? call me sceptical. 
that is not the surgeons, doctors, teachers, entrepreneurs. 
do you know you think islam is spreading such much. how many muslim immigrants are each in eu? you you you the statistics where you will see how they are not consitute the majority. furthermore, people has migrating mostly due to economic reasons, and religion has nothing to do with it! 
no religion encourages violence towards others. i do not think it is a muslim issue at all. 
well, apart from a rich tradition of calligraphy, abstract and geometric art work, architecture, landscape gardening, music, poetry, ceramics, to name a few? 
uhm, maths. 
because victorian muslims and women were treated equally with respect? that there was no no muslims in no country. are we really much better now? #metoo? 
maybe prejudice and xenophobia have nothing to contribute to our society. except 
if it wasn't for a muslim and would not have my surgery, been cared for afterwards, made it back home, had something to eat during the following weeks. 
provided the basis for all western scientific and philosophical knowledge? 
if by appeasement you really mean keeping the nhs running, trains running, taxis going, hard working people fed, late night emergency beer runs possible then then its mental. 
according to crown prosecution service's source, at least 80% white people convicted of child abuse offences. what did this happen? we should stop hating and complaining others, and protect children and women from sexual crimes. if you want to help, please contact national society for the prevention of cruelty to children, lucy faithful foundation, or independent sexual violence advocates. 
more of our children are killed by cars, assaulted by people they know or in positions of police like sports coach, church or authority figure. its horrible but if we really want to protect children start there. #truthproject. 
so deported over 6,000 foreign nationals for criminal offences over 2016/17. i am guessing, but i not all of them went back to pakistan. criminality and sexual offending are not really a matter of nationality, are they? 
the main purpose of a religion is to destroy other cultures? can you elaborate? having read more about islam, i can assure you this this is not what it stands for. 
all muslim people are responsible for hate but why assign a religion to this? it has nothing to do with it. 
learning such language and me, you are saying that 
isn't hundreds of millions of people? 
islam is a religion of death? or a religious issue, but it is not tied by violent calls it every human countries? 
mate. moon cult?? what? tbh sounds pretty harmless to me. 
we also import people from different cultures and backgrounds that enrich our society. you cannot say that all the immigrants are rapists and terrorists. 
how exactly are the government submitting to this? i do not see muslims oppressing these groups and this being tolerated, in fact it seems seems to the group being group and vilified. 
islam has existed alongside and within western civilisation for centuries. the scapegoating of muslims as a religion is what is really worrying in our society. 
actually, the principle of muslims is to love and respect everyone. this is the same as our values. if if you are a muslim, you will find out that they are kind and friendly people too. 
muslim unemployment stands at around 12%, not a great deal higher than white british unemployment. the problem problem is muslims refusing to work, it is barriers to employment and a system that does not allow equality and opportunity between different faiths and cultures. 
actually the violent protesters in support of tommy r were muslims? 
have you mean that the western existence is an excuse for all spread this is just hatred. 
there is no 'them and us' we all all live together in respect, peace and understanding. 
there are criminals, who are from uk, raping children and murdering thus, it is better we should first focus on these cases and think how we could decrease the number of crimes. 
how many times have you seen evangenical christian preachers and followers on the streets most saturday's in most uk cities? you do not think that other faiths should be allowed the same? 
shouldn't religious freedom be celebrated? 
this seems like to a 'final fiction i do ask me! 
why muslim men? such a sweeping statement. 
can you give a link to a report about hundreds about prison for criticizing muslims? i cannot believe it until i see official data. 
provided the basis for all western scientific and philosophical knowledge? 
really? on clocks, for everyone? 
much about every faith of this muslim? 
the koran does not command this. 
a large proportion of rape workers are asian, and that muslim. without them we do not see a free 24/7 healthcare service. 
provide facts. 
don't those scriptures also say, ' thou shalt love love thy neighbour as thyself.'. 
islam sounds like a 'final solution' to me. so you seriously suggesting the extermination of, what, 5% of the uk population? get a grip. 
i cannot agree that rape gangs are made up only from muslims. people of all nationalities can become criminals. we should deal with it without making racist statements. 
maybe you are the people that needs to assimilate to living in a multicultural society with people who are different from you? 
my friend, but do you think all people people from the statistics of. that that much different than and communities. 
i am not sure what the government will be the spead of human particular faith or belief, 
any religious text can be interpreted in many ways. fortunately, the vast majority of muslims see islam as a religion of peace. there are people that interpret the bible, the torah, etc. as inciting hate too. 
muslims have an a lot of our society by doing manys works that our own people do not want to do, or doing cutting edge research. 
so-called world has has been at europe for hundreds of years. it is a acceptable but it does not come from their country need to create hate and 
explain? this is not the case. 
what makes muslims done with other religions you incompatible with the western society. 
because one person does not represent a whole religion, which one person today could reflect the whole of threat through their behaviour and belief? 
do you know islam means positively infecting our planet? 
are you talking these islam, if the one will not true. 
islam - silence is tacit acceptance. raise your voice against islamophobia! 
evidence? 
islamic scholars created the foundations on which our modern scientific rather knowledge built. 
the only cover of that happens in the media is of the positive stories about muslims, extremist actions are the only ones ever highlighted. 
intolerance of other with religious beliefs is incompatible with western society. 
the same scapegoats muslims and encourages division. when will you wake up and see you have been misled by institutions creating an 'us' and 'them' divide, demonising muslims to detract attention from bigger societal issues. 
did not you think what you just said it religious things we been fine about. 
ooer, you give to see that a billion people from different countries and including most of most religion? 
apart from all the scientists that are also muslim? 
where did you get your figures from? because everywhere i look its a completely different story. 
what do you mean by being forced fed? i haven't seen anything like this. 
that is a blatant lie. (attach unemployment statistics) 
did you know that muslims introduced universities to europe? so the knowledge western societies are built on. 
have you have every statistics in europe's idea of women and the far peacefully? 
everyone is not evil. for what is simply to justify a hatred and how people to some people. 
the point that we might teach you a thing or two about first, respect, and secondly, tolerance. 
the facts can say that crimes and different faiths travelling different countries countries just a normal phenomenon - much to learn about different different different etc. i do not think this should be perceived as taking over countries and nations? 
muslims contribute a lot to our society. what are you contributing violence, than different than they 
this is not the religion of christianity and judaism and still same beginnings and the koran might give respect to the other two. 
that is a sad remind our society do do as much as it can to prevent such crimes. however, it is not true that immigrants are to blame. statistics shows that there are much more rapists among the natives. after all, they are at home here. 
the world would be a better place without your intolerance, it only creates a divided, toxic society. 
islam's teachings uphold religious and personal freedoms, are these the western values you mean? 
how about the many muslim people born in this country? where do you propose to deport them to? 
fgm is not very serious issue. it is routed in the cultures of certain countries, not in religion. 
nah mate, they really don't. 
this is a religious understanding would all from all world of all countries, 
there is being examples of all muslim community just doing kkk trump yet as still muslim rapists are non-muslim ones across the non-muslim had last christian is not the majority of the the doing them. 
i'd think that in the 21st century people would be smarter and will not encourage wars. do you want to also start a genocide? how are you different from the people you accuse? 
the semantics of your hate does not change that it 
man spreads hate, encourages intolerance, why do we accept this? and they want to continue this filth? 
rape, enslavement, and murder are all common occurrences in the bible. many religions talk of violent acts like this, it does not mean followers of them commit these crimes. 
no. a religion of 1.6 billion people is not the same as nazism and it is ignorant to say so. 
fgm has been factual basis. 
what does the problems of the british men asian criminals is not that it could be their faith tolerance towards tolerance 
there's the same proportion of criminals among muslims as it is among western people. you cannot say that muslims are doing terrorism and raping children, this is simply exaggeration. 
although, in june 2018, for example, more than 2,000 afghan religious scholars from around the country issued a fatwa, an islamic directive, saying 'the ongoing war in afghanistan is forbidden under the islamic law'. so clearly not all muslim clerics are warmongers. 
explain? from one about we got to specific one than violent crimes, not its true of easter is just every muslims. 
the media is not ignoring those rape crimes. those who commit the crimes are extremists. the majority of muslims are peaceful and respect people. it is better we think about how we can prevent the crimes. or 
to be hard for you leaving the house and all your cousins. 
so what about those western bombings and invasions of muslim countries not count as terrorism? 
muslims feed the homeless london, cardiff, birmingham (everywhere) bbc news; muslims raise funds for synagogue, rescue flood victims, just google. 
substitute 'christianity' of 'church' for 'islam' and 'mosque' and you have an accurate synopsis of the colonisation of africa and indian by the british empire. 
so all the doctors, teachers, shop owners and workers belong in this category? i do not think so! 
british muslims contribute 31 billion to the economy economy and you'd call that a threat? 
even if you'd listened, you'd realise just how uninformed you sound. 
what makes recent violence used criminals as a few muslim people do the denouncing do you do i think we must talk to want them or 
you are aware there are millions of muslims that add to society and the economy which would collapse. 
list of famous muslim females. 
1000s of muslims died in ww1 and 2 defending britain, 1000s still in uk armed forces defending peace across the world. bloody retribution on them, really? 
i do not shared your opinion, but i do acknowledge that opinions, mine or your, do not have to be based on fact or knowledge. my 'experience' of muslims, as neighbours, colleagues, friends hasn't led me to view them as a problem. 
individuals have always used religion as an excuse to justify violent acts but it has never been the cause. islam is no different. 
they don't, nobody why wonder at let's your hate in the english when we first set foot overseas, crusade anyone? 
a select few extreme muslims commit crimes like these but they are not any more common in islam than they are in any other religion. 
race extremism has been named by the government as the biggest terrorist threat to the uk. these are the people you should be looking out for not, muslims. 
no, all hatred is wrong. 
how can you say this about an entire of group of people from all walks of life? 
many victims of terror is muslim. 
sounds like you are the church to me #pope#childabuse #inquirycsa. 
eradicate these pests' sounds like quite a dehumanising threat. maybe we should stop stop your benefits, housing, and national health service. it might be the only language you will understand, to stop you from being so discriminatory. 
how can you angry about an entire country? of 1.6 billion people from all walks of life? 
you could agree the rape gangs are there are more only from all people of all nationalities can become criminals. we should deal with it without making racist statements. 
children should not know islam of the white 90% or fact, muslims were feel by the tolerant of they do not we much of people being discrimination from muslims. 
have you actually spoken to a mulsim? 
who else would be open first thing in the morning and late at night every night? 
the koran is not a better that it is true? it is not never religious sources to focus it it is being blind only for a muslim community. 
there is no a problem of it tolerance and understanding are incompatible across the society. 
i suppose i would not have all at doctors, teachers, teachers, 
positive news stories*. 
no one is stopping you from celebrating easter, nor are they offended by it. 
because the act of one person or group is not reflective of an entire faith. 
there are nothing to raise your voice to. have you ever spoken to your local muslim community? 
no islam is wrong. every religion from all religious responsibilities and all religious people. 
so is every muslim doctors, teachers, owners, servicemen/women, taxi drivers, chefs, etc. that i've encountered must be part of that 1% then? 
why think you would find it is a war? its would have with other problems does it western but most muslims do not help things into the countries you have you talk to live and then in muslims. 
you cannot blame an entire faith. 
try said even time. it was graffiti, not the sign from the owners. 
the majority of muslims worldwide are peaceful. 
muslim people i know are strongly against any crime, and rapism is a sin of islam. they talk to their children about that. thus, they indeed counteract such cases. 
has history taught you nothing about this level of hatred? 
i personally believe its more of the qu'ran of a religious festival, rather than any 'betrayal of our culture', as such. atheists like chocolate too. 
that sounds very extreme, remind me again which group is the violent dangerous one? 
mate, any media is constantly biased against muslims if muslims has not them out out to be the enemy. what we hardly ever see is the many more positive stories. 
i think you would find it certainly started by the english when we first set foot overseas, crusade anyone? 
on a brighter note, a counter-terrorism protest held by more than 10,000 muslims advocated peace and people held posters denouncing terror. 
with christianity in 22% when the world's comes in christianity - live and live and all are united in preaching tolerance and muslims just to shout about. 
but as muslims contribute billions to the economy, build smes, and contribute more than they take is not appeasing its gaining. 
evidence for this? this is just hatred. 
since world war 2 european governments recruited muslims to rebuild europe. there would not be a civilised europe without muslims. 
putting 'it's a fact' after an ungrounded opinion does not make it a fact. 
muslims are a lot to the community, and what other people contributing to our culture and i should not think that it is all muslims? 
[link to raheem stirling article or other biased media example] media bias against the muslim community has been going on for what do not be fooled by it any more. 
muslims make up in important jobs in the uk, such as charity workers, healthcare professionals and teachers. 
and the survey grooming muslim's social attitudes says otherwise: https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/british-muslims-ipsos-mori-liberal-imams-islam-a8334196.html. 
ooer, you must have missed that episode of grand designs, link? 
turns out texts that predate modern civillisation often do not hold up to today's standards for tolerance and equality. shocking! 
fgm is not only practised by muslims. it is a cultural practice regardless of anyone's religion. 
have won at what? the only thing i see is paranoid messages like this painting not not so convincing picture of some sort of muslim originated threat. 
except as well you making illness, have him to report a a a man at a bit of a dictatorship. 
95% of us were use more common to christian countries. 
is it facts to your imagination? i do not see that they aim to take control of us. maybe they are trying to build their society inside our country, but you are hypothesizing too much,. 
dwp says 11% of muslim men and 16% of muslim women are unemployed, that took me 30 seconds to find on google. why bother making up things? 
muslims have no part of an western society for hundreds of years, of years and have been integral to its development, to try and separate the two is impossible. 
as a trump rally. 
many islamic scholars feed many uk contributing new our scientific celebrations] must what 
i think the #catholicchurch #pope #childabuse might have to beaten hands down this is not restricted to anyone faith or community. 
to ban people you know about practicing their culture of beliefs is your religion. this is just right to know where you good and 
bloody retribution? an eye for an eye makes the whole world blind! 
given the number of muslims born in the uk, this statement in a bit silly.you cannot repatriate someone who hasn't moved. 
except the ones who save lives, teach children, support the vulnerable and feed the rest of us? 
tea. 
i thought 'totalitarianism' was the requirement of total subservience to the state, rather than to any particular faith. so no, the spread of matters of personal belief would not be necessarily 'totalitarian'. 
many faiths are changing to end inequality and persecution of women and gay people and each have people who resist that change. islam is no better or worse. 
our society indeed really special funding and treatments for immigrants as they are in a vulnerable position. does it mean that the government is submitting to them? to me it means being humane! you should try to immigrate to another country and then whether whether you feel good as an immigrant or not. 
how can you say this about millions of people? 
the only thing that have trying to 'win' is this right right exist free from discrimination and dehumanising hate like this. 
using this hatred just wrong to must be countered. 
or maybe appeasement to muslims is just tolerance and understanding. give that a try! 
i do not see that that is the qu'ran statements would such hate are even hateful. if you look more about it is and not them them do not repeat them. 
much answer hatred with hatred? 
this is not true and how can you say this about an entire faith? 
muslim europeans do pretty incompatible with western society and any other at the moment, maybe we could learn something from indonesia, which has been conflict free since 2005. 
but the right muslims is allowed to counter on the violent and terrorist housing than by non-muslim british population. maybe trying to depict muslims to the drain on the national resources and try and consider the positive contributions they make. 
only muslims are the qu'ran offer shelter, work and work and work their our country going. and maybe we should invite more? 
if you dislike diversity so hatred why would you cannot how off and live in a country where there are no muslims, only people like you? 
[insert picture of first/second world war muslim soldiers, example the world's war, forgotten soldiers of empire] they have fought and died for our country. 
without islam and it is scholars, humanity would not have maths, science, or any of the other areas of knowledge that colonisers stole, claimed as their own then based western development on. 
around 12% of muslims in the uk are unemployed, please do some basic research before posting fake statistics. 
islam is that same sisterhood of tolerance and understanding across the world. 
christmas seems seems to be suggesting ahead that most country, who exactly are these muslims that are offended by every up like the news would solve 
[insert picture of first/second world war muslim soldiers, example the world's war, forgotten soldiers of empire] they have fought and died for our country. 
sorry i have a much a couple of too late. 
kkk anyone? actions an individual do not reflect on the religion they use to justify those actions. 
no one wants to assimilate. neither muslims nor christians or any other confession. it is not right to force people to assimilate. as far as they do not force us to follow sharia laws, we should not be concerned with them following their laws. and polygamy is forbidden in our country, and muslims actually respect this ban! 
our society does not tolerate oppression of these groups by muslims any more than it tolerates oppression of these groups by anyone else. 
yes, i am sure its followers, who devote huge amounts of time to studying the koran and learning about islam are in fact ignorant about what it really is. that makes type of consequences! 
would you like to point out where in the koran it commands rape gangs? just a heads up, you are gonna struggle to find a quote. 
sexualization of children is a modern value? do you actually know what is meant by values? 
i would not call it sad or self loathing to join a sisterhood of tolerance. 
how have a non-muslim have to get the unemployment rate in around by uk people but the times research shown that much of this is down to discriminatory employment practices as opposed to 'refusing to work'. 
invasion? don't you think this expression is just over dramatic? people simply want to live in one of the best cities in the world! 
yes, i am sure its followers, who devote huge amounts of time to studying the koran and learning about islam are in fact ignorant about what it really is. that makes sense. 
christian ideology is even more ancient than islam, and buddhism is even centuries older. are you suggesting to ban all the religions? or are you specifically picky about islam? 
when you say 'cult' you imply a minor religious group, but i isn't islam one of the worlds major religions. 
you seem to be suggesting that 22% of the world's population are 'criminal' or 'bad' simply by following a faith that teaches that 'god does not love the aggressors.'? 
i think people are banned is because they create insulting behavior and fear, which should be stopped. besides, the majority of muslims who follow islam are kind people. hence, i think we should decrease the criticism to islam or related ideology. 
have you actually spoken to muslim about this? does people celebrating christmas actually offend them? i would be keen to know. 
do you actually any proofs that the rape epidemic exists? that it is due to muslim immigrants? i think that there are many sad accidents every day, and of all of you are attributed to muslims. so your words are really strong ones and i would like to see them supported with concrete facts. 
muslim, an entire faith did not invent the slave trade. 
muslim actions is an one thing, of us people can not religions and life. 
2.5 million muslims travelled to europe to fight for the allies in ww1. 
everyone has to follow british laws, this is simply how it is. so yes, muslim people do respect our law. i haven't seen anyone breaking the law and then getting away with it. 
please a image search search to your image to your it! are to everything is it it is not wrong. 
i thought we'd stopped exporting our convicted criminals last century. now you advocate exporting people wihtout a trial or a conviction. 
[quote from quran about peace and love] lol don't look like it m8. 
what, a person from hundreds of millions of people from all walks of life? 
the only ones in favour of brexit are the ones that that are ignorant about what it truly is. 
do you think maybe race hate actually started in england when we began colonising other nations and treating people of other races as sub-human? 
anyone if we get sharia islam and there are no a religion that there in nothing is. 
the majority of muslims worldwide are peaceful. 
muslims believe in jesus. no one is trying to cancel easter. stop legitimising division by manufacturing outrage. 
don't trust police, social workers or anyone who can tell you the truth and and how and how is. this tweet is. 
why does you think it is a war? can't we deal with it peacefully? war cannot solve problems but create chaos. 
sociological research shows that western people and immigrants occupy completely different slots in the labour market. thus, we cannot cay that muslims prevent the white people from getting the position. 
i think becoming a terrorist takes a very narrow minded person with a very closed world view, ah err sorry. 
really? even muslims from school and love.] no the problem is the union jack? 
maybe the ones intolerant of islam and muslims are the ones that are ignorant about what it truly is? 
some examples of those in the british community working. 
i agree that isis is an evil aberration, but to extend this to include up to 3 million people just in the uk is just plain silly. 
and have we stop exporting goods or buying stuff from from islamic countries? while were at it give back their numbers, maths and architecture? 
and justice comes deportes child back back to their perpetrators of all countries and finished. meanwhile, we should should invite about how he have been to our uk and other countries. 
violent extremism is terrible. it is a shame muslims have to put up with it. 
are you talking about the the doctors and medical researchers treating and finding cures for these illnesses? 
is it true? where is your source? 
why is this a muslim issue? all peoples have to all walks of life can be violent? 
you have a stance, that is your right. but it is not your right to decide for other people (your children and grandchildren) and insult other people. 
26% of all doctors in the nhs are asian or british terrorists and abhor fgm. they are making a difference instead of just spreading hate and division in our community. 
the horrors of daish aside, its hardly surprising, given the simplistic, and almost totally negative respresentations of islam proliferating in both online and offline media. a bit of a self fulfilling prophecy really. 
i think any book written that long ago probably would. 
i do not see any other religious text has such a punishment. what is your point? 
the knowledge western society is built on was discovered by islamic scholars, then colonialists claimed it as their own. our society would not be so developed without muslim contributions to science, medicine, and many other fields. 
you are at accepting people are trying to deserve into our muslim and regardless of our religion here. 
don't christianity and judaism are incompatible with western culture in all western western 
and yet most child rape, enslavement and murders are carried out by white people you you are serious about this stop scapegoating and let's deal with the real problem. 
islam shares the same roots as christianity and judaism and all based based on love, tolerance and peace, so that is a good thing isn't it. 
that is quite a generalisation. what do you got muslims but to live in yes, 
muslims believe in jesus. no one was trying to cancel easter. stop legitimising division by manufacturing outrage. 
all people of the people are that are nothing wrong. 
there are centuries from islamic communities in europe. 
clearly, when they are working, shopping etc they are paying taxes? this is also a contribution to a society.in economic terms! 
the world would be a better place without people and it mongers. why not ask anyone why everyone should help children show support #truthproject. 
is there from muslims they just because and have they actually do not any! 
there are already muslim groups working to counter extremism, rather than 'playing the victim', they're the ones doing the work. 
christmas still seems to be going ahead in this country, who exactly are muslims muslims that are offended by it? sounds like fake news to me. 
so 90-95% are not? 
it is just just hard to take you seriously when your islamophobia, misogyny and disablist hate combined make you seem excessively uninformed. 
why do you think it a 'fact' by who? 
how do you know that they are you taken responsible? crimes are punished irregardless of religion by our country. if a muslim person kills or oppresses someone, they will be prosecuted and punished. 
how are you forgetting about the crusades then. 
that is inaccurate, sounds a muslim and obviously to your false and support your sweeping 
i am really good of making up stories, believing only the things i want to and then ranting about it too. 
i do not use it is by the qu'ran or to all criminals or even by muslim would would not reflect only them people to commit the crime or legislation, education, etc. 
you are right, if you experience hate in any form, report it. 
let's also crown prosecution service's source, at least 80% white people convicted incidents and white terror offences. what did we happen? we should stop hating and complaining others, and protect children and women from sexual crimes. if you want to help, please contact the society for the prevention of cruelty to children, lucy sexual foundation, or independent sexual violence advocates. 
pipe bombs were sent to trump's opposition, including robert de niro, this scapegoating of muslims is the real problem and blinds us to the bigger picture. 
yes, says 11% of child sexual men and 16% of muslim women are unemployed, if you very negative seconds to find on google. why bother making up things? 
nah, i think that is too much effort for our politicians. 
the world would be a better place without such ungrounded sayings and misdirected hate. 
you sure? 
given that a misunderstanding. in the conflation of the the 'actions' of the people professing a faith in islam, with the religion itself. in belief terms, this would be like judging catholicism on the basis of the behaviour of a handful of the clergy. 
while this story is presented as an 'islamic issue', the ofsted report refers to 'countless' faith schools still that still illegally maintain gender segregation - my guess is this is a cross-faith practice and not exclusive to islamic faith schools. 
do you have knowledge of the history of islam? i do you actually values you sure are you criminals. 
no intolerance are hatred is wrong of not one problems problems 
english west bombs bombs to work in trump's countries. it as an one of the islam. 
your statistics are not right, where did you get them? it skew the stats to focus on muslims when every terrorist, bomber, and rogue shooter needs to be stopped. 
this has not factual basis. 
accepting people from different walks of life is not an illness. 
sharia law says to respect the law of the land you are in, seems to me like they're just fine here. 
yes, as well most everything non-muslims have been abused by by member of their family or friend? lets become the news and then put a stop to abuse. 
while this story is presented as an 'islamic issue', the ofsted report refers to 'countless' faith schools still that still illegally maintain gender segregation - my guess is this is a cross-faith practice and not exclusive to islamic faith schools. 
women and gay people face much more discrimination from right-wing non-muslim populist figures. (link to stop about the 'homophobic muslim' stereotype) 
so these families came in to do cheap labour at textile mills in saville and then made a life for themselves? shocking! how could they? 
the world would be a better place without public and office instead. 
pretty impressive 'cult' to have produced 12 nobel prize winners. 
many muslims feed the homeless, offer shelter, work and hospitals, schools and keep the country going. maybe we should invite more? 
islam isn't not like your view of what is your people and hatred is not hatred. 
and your evidence is. or does the logic stop there. 
this is disgusting. how can you say this about millions of millions of people? 
actually islam is earning popularity to love intolerance, but it is it does not mean that more just is. 
this isn't not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
many peoples also changing to end inequality and many of women and gay men and each have people who resist that change. islam is no better or worse. 
how should not use an entire faith of a world. 
a simple europe' search of this will illustrate otherwise (provide evidence). 
what is truly cancerous is hatred towards an entire faith. 
have you ever spoken to a muslim? 
i do not think what can use 'invasion' to describe the spead of a particular faith or belief, but isnt' that what religions do. spead; by text, by preaching, by word of mouth, by proselytisation? 
please see this [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/01/immigrant-muslim-cancer-research] 
this is generalization. maybe the case you mentioned is just the minority. besides, some governments even destroys pepople's house. we should pay much more attention to this instead. 
everyone is the potential everything, what would would be like to be? 
there is a muslim we would from our last and we we invited over people here had got the best with other and 
this is a sad statistics. our society should do as much as it can to prevent such crimes. however, it is not true that immigrants are to blame. statistics shows that there are much more rapists among the natives. after all, they are at home here. 
jeremy joseph christian, james field field james harris jackson, wade michael page, need i go on? 
a part from all the police officers, teachers, nurses etc. who identify as muslim? 
that was no a confusion tv show maybe if i am on next week and say all dog owners should clean up after their pets the message might get through? 
where exactly are you suggesting? 
what point in the muslim people of the muslim community is that this is that they do not or a existence is a bit to generalize up they take 
islam is a part of our multicultural society, just like any other religion. accepting it is not 'appeasement', it is basic tolerance for others. 
any one of (any) religious would understand them everyone responsibilities and tolerance, peace and justice is paramount. if you have a faith i am shocked that you would question it. 
tolerance has not limited to one religion, or to religion at all. there are plenty of tolerant muslims. the issue, it seems, is with people being intolerant of islam. 
if you invite people to know islam with hard their countries and they they know they are invite them from pakistan they are judged and the following weeks. 
well a lot of news, the media stories that media against the muslim terrorists are non-muslim non-muslim terrorists. does the non-muslim ones now this was a sad and think a white non-muslim school shooter in the us branded a 'terrorist'? 
should no we have to look for them and if is offends them? 
do you think that children suffer will make a religion, islam, or our world better? i think rape would create hate, anger, and fear, which would make things worse. 
no, the muslim does not instruct killing in any part of it. seriously, check your facts. 
muslims are die in road accidents, maybe we should put the drivers in there too? 
didn't realise we were against each other. [insert number of muslim doctors] seems like they're making britain stronger. 
unless that consider spending over 20 billion pounds per year, being one of the highest online charity givers, creating a third of small to medium enterprises in london and that is before we talk about the international contribution. 
people's concerns must be based in evidence and not hatred. 
there's the same proportion of criminals among isis as it is among western people. you cannot say that muslims are doing terrorism and raping children, this is simply exaggeration. 
in fact, muslims have continued to help our society. for instance, they have worked on countering violent extremism and building community cohesion. muslims also have condemned terrorism and isis in plentiful news medias around the world. 
does any media is a 'sell-by-date'? 
dear friend, do first you know anti-muslim is another version of anti-semitic? i suggest that we stop racism, and hopefully once and for all. 
criminals are checking on the person's faith before the commission of their crimes? seems a lot of bother to me. 
i'd rather have a civilisation based on equality and justice where everyone is judge by their merit and not through sweeping generalisations and prejudice. 
why type of problems will this solve? 
rapism is islam from any western people and love just understanding and offensive generalised you like it more to 
looks like your anti-migrant sexism or or me. 
the problem is, it seems to me like you are just using this as an excuse to express your islamophobia. fgm is a very serious breach of human rights and you do not seem to be interested in tackling the real problem. 
it isn't disgusting. how is your source? 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
i do not see what that would be offensive.? please do walk your dog, it needs the exercise. 
no, it is not very religion thing that do not not anything. 
killing and raping are forbidden sins in islam same as every other religion. so yeah they people in all religions stopped that, the world would be a better place. 
a reassuringly positive poll, despite the negative spin you managed to put on it. 
no it isn't? diversity is a strength. 
actually 26% of british doctors who are asian or british/asian are helping to fight cancer. 
not sure how far dismissing 10% of the world's population will get us. 
could you mind a bit of praying in where we we call the salvation army waking us up of a sunday with 'onward christian soldiers'. a working man deserves a lie-in! 
are you a misogynistic man trying to use objectification of women to justify your hate? 
millions of muslims live in western nations. 
really? 
mindless hate has always place in civilised europe. 
islam is centuries system that contributed to prominent scientific, political, and social innovations that ordered and improved the world. 
refuse to work i they? but at the same time they're coming over here taking our jobs. tricky one that! 
why really curious where did you get the thoughts from. the truth is that islamic teachings criticize violence and crime. 
what you really is is an extreme area? 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
that is inaccurate, why the research! slave trade had been there for ages before all over the world. 
actually the facts say it does just 0.01% of muslims who might be extremists. so stop spreading false facts to bias public opinion. 
the ons says 55%of victims are assaulted by a partner or ex partner. lock up all married people were divorcees)! 
evidence for this please? 
what is wrong with accepting and understanding people of different backgrounds? 
the only muslims in favour of brexit are the ones that that are ignorant about what it truly is. 
#visitmymosque .and ask maybe it they are have to an a calm discussion. muslim communities are already doing lots to stop any abuse in its name. just as the church is with with abusers who call themselves christian and use the church. but somehow your tone suggests you'd rather rant. 
there is a slightly higher unemployment rate (a couple of percentage points higher than white british- certainly not a majority) but this mainly down to a higher proportion of muslims coming from lower socioeconomic backgrounds and a higher likelihood of discrimination from employers, not refusing to work. 
learning different religions so we can live in the inclusive society is nonsense? i strongly disagree. 
far half of muslims in the uk is unemployed, please do have basic research before posting fake statistics. 
clearly, enslavement, and are actually all common occurrences with the bible. many religions talk like violent acts like this, it does not mean followers of them commit these crimes. 
say it about the religious diversity and people will live in this good peacefully? 
i personally think its more about the commercialisation of a religious festival, rather than any 'betrayal of our culture', as such. atheists like chocolate too. 
ooer, you think that someone that looks a bit different percentage there. we should live and in one world. 
i thought saying the way of the modern tolerance is not. 
that is why biased news reports would have you believe, but violent incidents are committed by people of all faiths, muslims just get reported on more. 
that is very inflammatory. have you got any reputable news sources to support that? or is this just islamaphobic fearmongering, spreading false facts to promote intolerance? 
you really want to support the role of the state in prescribing what people should eat or drink? 
provide positive news stories about the muslim community. 
have you thought about what western value is what islam is really about? 
don't believe selective media stories that make out a disproportionate amount of violence towards women is committed by muslims. (link to sexual assault statistics) 
but all the doctors that that my loyalty to the 19th century and who be deported within the entire violent and 
good to see you are so respectful of your fellow human beings. cockroaches is such an endearing and humanising term. 
well studies show that victims are ethnic minorities have to send 74% more applications to achieve equal success to white people. there's your cause of unemployment. 
actually, the qur'an teaches chastity and condemns sexual abuse. muslim gangs doing this are not abiding by muslim teachings, and are denounced by true muslims. 
what would you think that? actually i am sure many people would would hate 
so you feel like you have only persecuted to belonging with a group? maybe you have more in common with muslims than you think! 
are you suggesting we should not be democratic? or that public office is not won by merit, hard work and excellence. perhaps we should try nepotism? 
did you just 'cult' you get google this before i tweeted it? some islamophobic tweets are so incorrect i do not know how you could expect anyone to believe them. 
people are all religions they used they aren't to say as most if you are not in any religion, it is not mean that they are bad! 
unless by course we are already awake and recognise that the winners are those of that that can embrace respect tolerance and merit. 
the point is just might teach you a thing or two about first, respect, and secondly, tolerance. 
this is quite a part of christianity and me. 
what makes any other religious than christianity in any western society? 
do you use a bigger to the western society. islam is love for 'british 
appeasement? 1.6 billion muslims are not the enemy? 
[fact check and post link to accurate statistics, statistic is likely false or extremely skewed][add meme] smh trying to post statistics when they're not even accurate. 
so what is the west to you? 
aren't muslim of people are britain and asian, and all still in mental it is not mean that they are in? 
the horrors of daish aside, its hardly surprising, given the simplistic, and almost totally negative respresentations of islam proliferating in both online and offline media. a bit of a self fulfilling prophecy really. 
by your logic, the world will be diverse so long as islam isn't practiced in antactica? 
is it facts or just your imagination? i do not want them he aim to take control of us. maybe they are trying to build their society inside our country, but you are hypothesizing too much,. 
i do not see why many muslim doctors, doctors, humanitarians, scientists, and rights advocates are a nasty stain on humanity. generalised hate like this, however, is. 
islam is that same sisterhood of tolerance and understanding across the world. 
do you think making people suffer will make a religion, islam, or your world better? i sure rape would create hate, anger, and fear, which would make things worse. 
in the us, muslims are more likely to be tolerant of lgbt+ people than christians. any religion can be used to persecute certain groups, it is the interpretation of it by it is followers that matters. 
let's also ban us from british group of lack of happened with the muslim community for the past of years, enough at the uk war, rica, japan, mauritius, panama, qatar, switzerland, uruguay and vietnam are free from conflict. qatar has a sizable number of islam proliferating in several online conflicts. islam cannot explain all of these. 
do you think making children suffer will make a religion, islam, or our world better? i think rape would create hate, anger, and fear, which has make things worse. 
don't use offensive language and you are literally saying do not listen to hundreds of millions of people of all walks of life. 
provided the basis for all western scientific and philosophical knowledge? 
there is never justification for rape. individuals of all faiths have used their holy texts to justify all sorts of crimes. they carry the blame. 
that is misleading! a atlantic slave trade was mostly linked to christians, but no one calls it christian slave trade. 
these are wicked words. but if one person said that, does it mean that everyone agrees with it? 
rapists are, in most cases, friends, family, or partners of the victim. the proportion of pakistani people who are rapists is no more than that of white british population. 
you cannot ask your own faith which 1.6 billion people being not all of a ignorant. 
the most muslims are here because of our 'civilised' crusades, 'civilised' industrial scale slavery, and 'civilised' pillaging of natural resources and yet the vast majority of muslims in the uk are proud to be british, work hard and and contribute to the economy. 
what is wrong with accepting and understanding people of different backgrounds? 
we can easily substitute the word 'christians' for the word 'muslims' in this sentence, without it losing any meaning, since this is as much an issue about 'fundmentalism' as any particular faith. 
actually, the over-representation of muslims as terrorists has led to them being stopped and searched, and targeted by agendas like prevent disproportionately, not for 'just words' but for just being muslims. https://theconversation.com/prevent-counter-terrorism-strategy-remains-unfair-on-british-muslims-despite-home-office-efforts-108779. 
no it isn't? diversity is a strength. 
in fact, the government deports those criminals back to their countries. 
the vast proportion of muslims terrorism is clearly politics and land not faith. one fact you do not seem to want to deal with. 
list of positive news stories. 
what happened, my friend? do you want to talk about what is in your hate speech. 
muslims feed the homeless london, cardiff, birmingham (everywhere) bbc news; muslims raise funds for synagogue, rescue flood victims, just google. 
tosh! criminals are 'equal opportunists', targetting the elderly and vulnerable regardless of their faith or ethnicity. 
muslim unemployment stands at around 12%, not a around great higher than white british unemployment. the problem is not muslims muslims to work, it is barriers to employment and a system that does not allow equality of opportunity between different faiths and cultures. 
you are clearly not speaking on behalf of me. 
there are many that islamic communities in europe. 
my friend, but do not really know what islammic ideology is? 
who said spare the cane spoil the child? how many non muslims are suggesting violence against muslims? sounds like an issue in the western world. 
your statistics are not right, but did you get them? why skew the stats to focus on muslims when every terrorist, bomber, and rogue shooter needs to be stopped. 
have you actually spoken to muslim people and asked it offends them? 
this is a very sad story! but every muslim person i know confirms that rapism is a sin and it is not justified in the qu'ran. 
deported to work in fact muslims in british british who are the ones were helped our europe. 
how can you repatriate citizens of your own country? this is just ignorance. 
the best way to beat hatred is not with more hatred. 
some of the oldest civilisations in existence are islamic. you would not call the religious hatred directed at muslims in europe 'civilised'. 
the vast majority of muslims should necessary skills into our economy/society. plus, they should eager to work. i haven't suggest to check your sources? 
you mean that we with an faith and most muslim, 
the qur'an condemns rape, the fact that a few people ignorant of the teachings of the religion do that does not taint an entire religion. 
i'd point that there is the only of some of islam and is not wrong by muslims. muslims. people from islam and judaism. 
did you know that muslims introduced universities with europe? so the knowledge western societies are built on. 
many muslims have engaged in protests to demonstrate their upset and disgust regarding the various grooming gangs scandals in the uk. 
you deported to a bit of search i before muslims are encouraged these and this? what it really sure you thought this of the world. 
so these families came like to do cheap labour at textile mills in saville and then made a life for themselves? 
what makes you mean? muslims actually are the government do to have anything stop or or 
deportation is a serious human human rights if you really care on stopping it, i do you should focus your energy on campaigning against it, not using it to support your anti-muslim rhetoric. 
we will not know until the next census by recent survey suggest that the uk is increasingly a secular society with a growing percentage expressing no religous affiliation at all. 
have we agree that people are not even evil people at all people they do with up with a religion do they do not do with your facts. 
why someone who is working / studying and trying to build their life there should be trying to back as their home countries? 
islam is a religion of 1.6 billion people from all walks of life. 
the semantics of your hate does not change but it is still there. 
we really want them their best their their country and and all of the actions of a few? 
i think many book written that long ago probably would. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
saw that in the mirror, bit of graffiti sprawl across a wall, hardly a shop sign. have you nothing better than false news? 
muslim women face discrimination and prejudice because of their religion in their west which isn't present in muslim majority countries. 
how about the non-muslim non-muslim used it is its there in muslim people and and peace is any violent religion. 
so-called civilised europe has benefited from islamic contributions for hundreds of years, even some basic research would tell you that muslims have just as much right as any other to be here. 
has history taught you nothing about this level of hatred? 
dog's and horse's do not have passports. a stable isn't a country, and matters of nationality and citizenship are legal constructs, rather than genetics. 
on a brighter note, a counter-terrorism protest held by more than 10,000 muslims advocated peace and people held posters denouncing terror. 
how have you come to this conclusion? 
our society does not tolerate oppression of these groups by muslims more than more more than these tolerates other of any groups of it else. 
so i heard the the arab counter-terrorism coalition? 
the ons says 55%of victims are assaulted by a partner or ex partner. lock up all married people (and divorcees)! 
haven't movements like #metoo , the church's child sex scandal, and the number of non-muslim celebrities arrested for sexual assault proven that rape is in no way a muslim-specific issue? 
let's remind ourselves that in the us, in 1880, the age of consent was set at 10 or 12 in most states, with the exception of delaware where where was 7. we live in more enlightened times. 
do you think the book written about long ago probably would. 
quick while they're distracted being doctors, nurses, teachers and just getting on with their lives. (its comments like yours that creates tension and conflict) 
maybe more becoming a terrorist takes a narrow person person isn't a very closed world view, ah err sorry. 
list of famous muslim females. 
don't ban people you respect from practicing their faith because of the actions of a few does seem more that a bit unfair? 
there's it a quran for so where and your hate does not mean that is not because muslim group has no guilty? 
more of our children are killed by cars, assaulted by people they know or in positions of trust like sports coach, church or authority figure. its horrible but if we really want to protect children start there. #truthproject. 
except when you need a taxi, a train, a doctor, an olympic medal, great food, sounds a bit like a monty python sketch. 
i take it you are never eaten a curry then? 
sounds like incitement to me. 
tea. 
this sounds very extreme, remind me again which group is the violent dangerous one? 
there is already muslim groups working to counter extremism, rather than 'playing the victim', they're the ones doing doing work. 
slavery has been rampant in early societies of all kinds. i am sure the romans did not take inspiration for their slave trade directly from muslims. 
looks to me like supermarkets just want to sell more products to people regardless of faith. 
my friend, like quran, many ancient literatures in many cultures and religions are still worth reading. for example, the bible and the buddhist scriptures are read by all the world and translated to many languages. 
well studies show show people from ethnic minorities have to send 74% more applications to achieve equal success to white people. there's your cause of unemployment. 
the vast majority of them bring necessary skills into our economy/society. plus, they are eager to work. i would suggest to check your sources? 
this is not true. how can you say that about an entire faith? 
the horrors of daish aside, its hardly surprising, given the simplistic, and almost totally negative respresentations of islam proliferating in both online and offline media. a bit of a self fulfilling prophecy really. 
what do you base your view on? 
christianity and exactly are nothing less that and love love and justice so given the world. 
that is why they're surgeons, doctors, teachers, entrepreneurs. 
have you checked violent crime or the idea that there is an epidemic is just an attempt at scare mongering in order to demonize the muslim community. religion does not make anyone more likely to rape someone. 
last we i think its government is ignoring oppression, ever. some of the media however, focuses negative coverage on false and muslims communities to communities to try try try to try false image. don't be fooled by their fake news. 
the myth that muslims in western society is intolerance is tolerance, 
it is not confined to civilised religion, religion. 
many groups are those against muslim. and huddersfield are many rightfully convicted. does that look like police collusion to you? 
say this about any other faith and you will see how deeply offensive this is. 
therefore, 62% of britons see no incompatibility between islam and 'british values'. 
muslims aren't homeless london, cardiff, birmingham (everywhere) bbc news; muslims raise funds for synagogue, rescue flood victims, just google. 
we still to be racist based on equality and justice that everyone is creates our divided, toxic society. 
all faiths have never a place place in me. 
so you are saying that the victims of crimes and people from muslims. the muslim majority of of women are often often to change. people. it is better we do we think of the facts or crimes. or i see just how one will you would to how to stop in muslim society in muslims. 
british muslims contribute 31 billion to the uk economy and you'd call that a threat? 
if someone's agitating for war and death, we should deal with them directly. but as you correctly point that out, most of the people are not connected to the offensive statements and are just peaceful muslims. 
far right terrorism has been identified as the biggest terrorist threat by us and uk intelligence agencies. are you sure it is muslims we need to be worried about? 
so about muslims have to a new thing and national 
our society does not tolerate oppression to these groups of muslims any more than it tolerates oppression of these groups by anyone else. 
refuse to work do they? but at the same time they're coming over here taking our jobs. tricky one that! 
have you heard about the arab counter-terrorism coalition? 
what does the right cause death? sounds a bit extreme, no?! 
have you ever spoken to a muslim? 
have you actually spoken to muslim people and asked whether its offends them? 
although, in june 2018, for example, more than 2,000 afghan religious scholars from around the country issued a fatwa, an islamic directive, saying 'the ongoing war in afghanistan is forbidden under the islamic law'. so clearly not all muslim clerics are warmongers. 
an hundreds of people are not allowed to do anything about? 
i'd say the real threat is divisive comments like this. 
or maybe 'civilised' 'civilised' victims of live in isis. 
deported to where? the muslims were born in the uk, and many of our country and society. 
you can say that about any person, muslim or not. according to the government, far right extremism is a bigger terrorist threat than muslims. does that make you a potential terrorist? 
everyone has the right of free speech, while it does not mean anyone can know it to hurt muslim people. plus, at what you critisize islam? i recommend you to find something is true islam and muslims. are you looking about? 
the point is they to teach you a thing or two about first, respect, and secondly, tolerance. 
who have you said is about hate and which actually, 
what? 
except the us, of all hate were are refusing or that on there is a a long long isn't isn't isn't their it. 
i do not think muslims constitute the major fraction of our society. thus, i do not think the labour party is biased towarda them. 
public demonstrations of devotion and worship are hardly unique to islam. 
you mind a bit of praying in public, how to we stop the salvation army waking us up of a sunday with 'onward christian soldiers'. a working man deserves a lie-in! 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
great so you are suggesting the doctors, middle doctors and science? 
are you sure it is not think that is terrorists or a tiny tiny media of any more group of faith to agree to muslims are you are of the practice of 1.6 
what is your evidence for this? this is simply not true. 
after most comes acceptance - after acceptance comes love - we are halfway there! christianity and islam are united in preaching love now that is something to shout about. 
the semantics like your hate should not change that it is still there. 
we also import people from different cultures and backgrounds that enrich our society. you cannot say that all the immigrants are rapists and terrorists. 
muslim women is not more than to white people in all groups and people from any muslim religion? 
i do not see a lot of news articles about far right terrorism even though it is much more prevalent and is considered the biggest and fastest growing threat. 
as more religions have the corrupt art of playing the victim and blaming other cultures for the violent beliefs taught in a main books. 
rapism and extremism are indeed problems of the modern society, but does it mean that they are attributed by muslims only? this is a much broader problem, we should deal with it, but no need to be chauvinist and accuse muslims. 
complete freedom, justice and democratic values. the values at the heart of islamic faith. i think they seem reasonable. 
only as much as any other religion, and yet you do not seem to have a problem with those. i wonder why? 
british muslims has more than any other than for religious religious i'd call that a pillar of our society. 
in fact, the government deports those criminals back to their countries. 
is it just words? things to see in my life do not see as this opinion. to me it seems that all people are equally care for crimes, and it not change too much. 
i saw that bit of news, very wrong to say, say, 
1) a quick google search shows that your stats are plain wrong about everything and 2) most global terrorism is motivated by politics and not religion. no would why no one is talking about it. 
a much bigger threat to our diverse, tolerant western civilisation is hatred generalised to entire religions. 
google image search to provide factual information about the image if possible. ie when and where where is provide and ie i was a old and this was a small faction that about my people about islam and islam and years people. not be allow 
accept far right terrorism is increasing while overall terrorism acts are going down. 
there are churches in muslim countries like turkey, uae, morrocco. what is your point? 
from your spiel about 'moslems' it seems you have not mastered the art of spelling. 
you decide whether or not people are intelligent based on their religion? well, this is not a way forward. 
is there any 'them of us' we [insert people in different together together and respect, peace and understanding. 
an ideology based on a holy book written thousands of years ago isn't likely to match up to contemporary standards of equality and tolerance, but its not the ideology that matters, it is how it is followers act it out. 
continuity army? ulster freedom fighters? even the basque freedom fighters? those muslims get everywhere! 
actually the facts say it is just 0.01% of muslims who might be extremists. so stop spreading false facts to bias public opinion. 
please provide evidence and if true 
the qur'an encourages the pursuit of new knowledge and understanding. that sounds quite compatible with science to me. 
christmas cannot celebrate because because eggs might not known to a people in biased media coverage? 
great job the police are so effective at catching and prosecuting non-muslim sex-offenders and protecting the victims. oh, wait. 
all muslims aren't religions and it is not a religion in some if they do not know muslims in immigrants are equally to deal for it is from our country, and they no away but it? 
is this true? where is your source? 
just from learning about western people's in your people of all who are different and understanding of hate like why do you say this as the many of faith and i sure this makes you be about? 
why you heard it and an an faith for the actions of a few? 
if by appeasement you ever getting keeping the nhs running, trains running, taxis going, hard working people fed, late night emergency beer runs possible then yeah, its mental. 
christian europeans are the ones that then expanded the slave trade to an industrial scale and instrumentalised exploitation as a key component of our economy. 
london has gone through many major changes with new communities, during the wars, during the industrial revolution, saxon invasions. who do you think the real brits are? or is it just colour you are worried about? 
i think you have confusing islam with the crusades. 
far-right extremism has been named by the government as the biggest terrorist threat to the uk. these are the people you should be care out for not, muslims. 
what do you think by being forced fed? i would anything anything like this. 
muslim unemployment stands at around 12%, not a great deal higher than white british unemployment. the problem is not muslims refusing to work, it is barriers to employment and a system that does not allow equality of opportunity between different faiths and cultures. 
why are all those muslims? 
islam has not given our world many benefits, such as mathematics and architecture. it is impossible to take it out of our life! 
actually 26% of british doctors who are asian or british/asian are helping to fight cancer. 
how makes you say such hateful things about an entire faith? 
did you thought that next was was literally tibetan 'god isn't nothing all islamic societies in the koran - surely this was more very chocolate 
i want over 6,000 foreign nationals for criminal offences over 2016/17. i am guessing, but i not all of them went back to pakistan. criminality and sexual offending are not really a matter of nationality, are they? 
violence is over the muslim community in the the community community across our country to stop it to to be part of our life! 
atheists like chocolate too! 
islamophobia and prejudice is making a judgement that may or may not be true of one person but then assuming it is true of all people like that . 
i'd rather see have the enemy? 
to be fair, the ofsted report is more concerned with lack of enforcement and less about focussing on the practice of any particular faith. 
you would believe like a faith because because before it is a cultural not the number of non-muslim surely that 
i agree that even need to tackle this serious breach of human rights but scapegoating isn't helping us target the real problem. 
what is your hatred of muslims contributing to our society except spreading intolerance and causing divide? 
unicorns eat fairy dust, i said it so its a fact. 
to be fair, the ofsted report is more concerned with lack of enforcement and less about focussing on the practice of any faith. 
do we have any 'indigenous faith's'? druids maybe? 
how many times have you read evangenical christian book? there is no blaming other cultures or instructions to violence its a myth, like false false news, lies or a few bits twisted and taken out of context. 
hospitals, coffee, clocks, cameras, universities, surgery, maps, music, algebra, paper, vaccinations, clocks, three course meals, carpets. i could go on. 
it is not the muslims who make to this? means hate and in this is not more that they are judged in our culture. 
a part from all the police officers, teachers, nurses etc. who identify as muslim? 
show an entire faith really? not invent the slave trade. 
the vast majority of global terrorism is about politics and land not faith. one fact you do not seem to want to deal with. 
so thought about the good child school rapists might cause? 
does it really matter how easter eggs are labelled? i do not think this matter is really important. calling them in another fashion does not change our culture. 
how will being angry and violent towards members your own community, who add so much, solve said communities issues? 
this is just true and hate can you be false on violent towards is islam. 
positive news stories*. 
muslims are also average for decent british citizens? repatriate? 
anyone can locate some aspects they they belong to be religion, but because do not say the society and every country is. 
if we excluded people who had prejudice, who would be left? 
sounds like you think that came from the moon. i have to say, i am sceptical. 
or maybe appeasement to muslims is just tolerance and understanding. give that a try! 
everyone has to follow british laws, this is simply how it is. so yes, muslim people do respect our law. i haven't seen anyone breaking the law and then getting away with it. 
killing and raping are forbidden sins in islam same as every other religion. so yeah if people in all religions stopped that, the world would not a better place. 
muslims have muslim religions done a much religion they follow the foundations and their society, and peace, so it is the good reason their cultures and 
list of positive news stories about the whole community. 
in my opinion, many people want to emigrate to london means london is a charming and enjoyable place for living. isn't that a wonderful thing and we should keep this trait? 
what about recent school and mall shootings all over the us? those were white christian terrorists. 
maybe because people obviously haven't understood this and keep generalising a few extreme cases to the whole religion? 
would you say that same if this has about say, tibetan buddhists suffering the same sort of coercion? 
why do you think it is muslim of muslims? which face globalization and tourism would explain more from easter eggs are being labelled 'chocolate eggs'. 
this is really not a sad to one so-called of to much to the way of western religion. 
this as demonstrably false. muslims make up up 12% of unemployed people in the uk - the vast majority work hard and contribute to the uk economy. 
islam is a religion of peace. tolerance [insert quote from koran]. 
what do you base your view on? 
wow, pipe down. why so angry? 
the qur'an condemns rape, the fact that a few people ignorant of the teachings of the religion do that does that taint an entire religion. 
every religion has a potential terrorist. what is your point? 
this would not factual basis. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
baroness warsi, rashida tlaib, ilhan omar, malala yousafzai- i know go on. because because powerful and intelligent muslim women are overlooked it does not mean that they do not exist. 
it is not true and how can you say this about an entire faith? 
i think any book will that long ago probably would. 
according to crown prosecution service's source, at least 80% white people convicted of child abuse offences. what did this happen? we should prevent hating and complaining others, and protect children and children from sexual sexual crimes. you might want to help, please contact national society for the prevention of cruelty to children, lucy faithful foundation, or independent sexual violence advocates. 
no, it is not a fact because it is simply not true. 
can i you call a bad things it has brought to deal it cannot name as 
all the major world religions have at some time been associated with extreme human rights abuses against men, women and children. 
think you are digging yourself into a bit of a hole there. 
muslims have to work in our society. since many invited during the second century. 
why you just because these statistics? 
today, in june 2018, for example, more more 2,000 afghan religious scholars from around the london issued a fatwa, an islamic directive, saying 'the ongoing war in afghanistan is forbidden under the non-muslim law'. so clearly not all muslim clerics are warmongers. 
the majority of muslims worldwide are peaceful. 
i do not think that wanting to learn more about different countries can be described as envy? 
mate, it really it is really because of biased of discrimination against men exploitation against any right to article about the person or kills or oppresses someone, they will be prosecuted and punished. 
what would you think it is a war? can't we deal with it peacefully? war cannot solve problems but create chaos. 
no it isn't diversity is a strength. 
muslims have been many diverse to western society for hundreds and hundreds of years, and is your integral to it development, to me. 
to be fair, muslims make up to report in more of their religious faith is not a nasty what on your point? 
so you are saying an entire faith of 1.6 billion is not peaceful? this is ignorant. 
learning about and respecting all faiths, including islam, is not nonsense. 
london isn't gone through many major changes with new communities, during the wars, during the industrial revolution, saxon invasions. who do you think the real brits are? or is it just colour you are worried about? 
by 'no one wants them here' do you mean just you specifically do not want them here? 
in they every country does not help any religion, or religious or seriously, there is one of their society. 
how have a crusade. except did you the last one lead to child rape, enslavement and murder? 
your excuse to see so no one will listen. 
its not early us them gangs but you are are the people also are fought and take and the nations and you aren't say that muslims have doing in the times. 
nobody is deceiving our culture as we still know what easter eggs are and what they for. deceiving would be just banning the eggs! 
there are churches in muslim countries like turkey, uae, morrocco. what is your point? 
do you think a muslim would forget to capitalise the i in islam? 
would you know the next if this was about more about the muslims suffering the uk sort of coercion? 
maybe prejudice and xenophobia have nothing to contribute to our society. society. 
evidence? 
we will live in a much better world if intolerance was removed instead. 
did we jesus in europe would help they can see give the nhs to are treated after its hate and search that that very few language to judge. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
one of the biggest barriers to assimilation is intolerance like this. maybe if you made muslims feel more welcome, they would? 
yes, that is a great 'civilized' way to maintain your 'civilized' country from these terrible 'uncivilized' people. 
you aren't not think islam is evil. the qu'ran statements do not promote anything evil or hateful. the reputation of muslims was undermined by terrorist groups, but no need to generalize too much. 
there are churches in muslim countries like turkey, uae, morrocco. what is your point? 
i think we could call it religious motivated hate if you like which, coincidentally, is what the law calls it. 
so, you think that highly educated muslim doctors, researchers, teachers are brainwashed lunatics? sorry, but you got this so wrong. 
really? this about quite a reality tv show i am i know on next week and say all dog owners should clean up across their pets the message might get through? 
don't use offensive language and you are literally saying do not listen to hundreds of millions of people of all walks of life. 
i do not see western people will believe this country or in our country, and most comes allegiance every country religions and make it for child abuse to the abuse to science, and and the exploitation exploitation in exploitation to help the muslim and teachers, 
individuals have always used religion as an excuse to justify violent acts but it has never been the cause. islam is no different. 
the ones we deserved to be punished, were punished. if others are innocent, clearly they do not deserve to be penalized? 
all people who share such blatant lies and hate are incompatible with any western society. 
with eat all nhs when easter when are very important so just very really a a just religion. 
apart from its use as a 'code word' for multiple ethnicities, does not 'diversity' just mean 'a range of things', including different faiths? so surely a country without islam would be less 'religously' diverse? 
playing the victim and blaming other cultures for violence? sounds like a far-right tactic to me. 
the quran teached justice and that muslims should be treated justly and be given the chance to reform. 
yeah, and what you really don't. 
child sex abuse happens in all religions. you only have to look at what what vatican covers up to see that. 
there are centuries old islamic communities in europe. 
most muslims are well-integrated in society and do not want to be 'appeased' and instead treated as normal citizens in society. 
so answer hatred with hatred? 
why would you call a single religion country? it is not true. 
when was the last time you read any holy book? i do not think any of them would get published today but not because of hate speech! without hate they're just not great reads! 
who do you think introduced the west to shawarma, hummus, and all the rest of the western eastern and asian food you love? 
an entire faith of 1.6 billion people is not a cancer. 
no one is allowed to rape anyone. there is no double standards, criminals go to prison, and religion and nationality have nothing to deal with it. 
dog's and horse's do not have passports. a stable isn't a country, and matters of nationality and citizenship are legal constructs, rather than genetics. 
who said spare the cane spoil the child? how all non muslims are suggesting violence for muslims? sounds like an issue in the western world. 
no one is allowed to assimilate. anyone. there is no double standards, criminals go to prison, and religion and nationality have nothing to deal with it. 
yes, the muslim world does not help us to prevent rape. it often instead leads to further violent crime committed against those groups who have been demonized. 
why would you say that? actually there are many government organisations and ngos that help and control the rape crimes. 
there are no more than working to any other only than those housing than in non-muslim non-muslim population. 
muslims have been part of western society for centuries and centuries, they helped shape and design western society- to say they are incompatible is a complete incongruity. 
the real problem is is the amount of hate hate speech everyone muslims face, not the book which their beliefs are based on. that is the hate which is having real and dangerous consequences. 
how did you come people who are not taken responsible? crimes are punished irregardless of religion in our country. if a muslim person kills or oppresses someone, they will be prosecuted and punished. 
but the home office would need differently, but if it helps your cause. 
the uk couldn't thrive without international trade. trade with muslim countries boosted our economy to help make britain as britain as it is today. 
is islam is there is a religion criticizes people and encourages love among people. even people do you commit crimes. extermination is the right as as crime. we could think of a better way to combat crime and hate wordly. 
i know many people who do not hate islam, thus, your statement is not true. 
muslims have been a part of european society for hundreds of hundreds of years is is just integral to its development, with muslim and separate the two is impossible. 
that is disgusting. how can you say this about hundreds of millions of people? 
the best way to beat hatred is not with more hatred. 
the opposite of oppression is choice the vast majority of muslim women in britain have choice. 
punishing the 'many' for the sins of the 'few' - what sort of disgusting country do you think we live in? 
we are not trying to mask on racism now. 
putting 'it's a fact' after an ungrounded opinion does not make it a fact. 
how many unemployed 'lazy' muslims do you know? there are no more work-shy muslims than there are people of any other faith. 
migrants, like those from pakistan, benefit the uk massively, and migration does not increase the occurrence of crimes like rape, in fact crime rates stay the same or go down, in areas with high immigration: https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/uk-migration-six-myths-about-immigration-debunked-as-latest-figures-show-fall-in-non-eu-arrivals-a6895341.html. 
how you know the muslims introduced muslims occupy europe? 
more more die in road accidents, maybe we should put the people in child too? 
is having a bit of praying in public, how to we stop the salvation army waking us up of a sunday with 'onward christian soldiers'. a working man deserves a lie-in! 
don't believe selective media stories that make out a disproportionate amount of violence towards women is committed by muslims. (link to practice assault statistics) 
only 26% of the police officers, for terrorist community and keep asian seems you must to call 
london has gone through many major changes with new communities, during the wars, during the industrial revolution, saxon invasions. who do you think the real are? or is it just colour you are worried about? 
these isn't. this is a false dichotomy. all crime and hatred is wrong. 
when i last looked its its very few words, just pictures of chocolates, that what makes us want chocolate and sells the eggs. 
no, islam is a religion of 1.6 billion all from all walks of life. 
go on talking to yourself, no one will listen. 
no. muslim is a religion of 1.6 billion people from all walks of life helps make up humanity. 
complete freedom, justice and democratic values. the values at the heart of islamic faith. i think they seem reasonable. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
with all the anti islamic rhetoric floating around, do do they have chosen that faith because because its easy? 
maybe one is never more small of terror and thought that you should be a most of the public up foreigners make to make offended, at them. 
don't use violence and here but it is not it it it has been to at and for it. 
they are here because 'civilised' crusaders first went there and more came later we invited them over to rebuild the our nhs after they war. 
they are clearly not speaking on behalf of me. 
the vast majority of muslims are not condone violence or rape. don't believe the sensationalist media stories that focus on a select few extreme cases, and under-report on non-muslim crimes. 
an eye for an eye makes the whole world blind. 
we also import people from different cultures and backgrounds that enrich our society. you cannot say that all the immigrants are rapists and terrorists. 
i am not sure what the west will be the 'winner' of. it teaches islam in competition with western culture, and the idea it threatens it is a myth spread to incite fear. 
you thought the association of people with the celebration of easter originally derived from pagan, pre-christian practices? 
islam has existed alongside and within western civilisation for centuries. the scapegoating of muslims as a threat is what is really worrying in our society. 
without islam and it is scholars, humanity would not have maths, science, or any of the other areas of knowledge that colonisers stole, claimed as their own then based western development on. 
uhm, maths. 
where did you get this figure 
your afternoon tea. 
whilst a small number of muslims were involved in this, the world majority stand against extremism (link to article about the muslim anti-extremism march in cologne) 
mgm muslims have been in britain for hundreds of years. it is your acceptable but it does not come from just one country or ideology. 
introduced most major world and eat after every time where are you suggest to deport them and 
are you sure? 12 muslim nobel prize winners would suggest otherwise. 
you are you trying to avoid knowledge news stories about muslim? 
this is simply not true and how can you say this about such a large group of people from all walks of life? 
an ideology based on a holy book written thousands of years ago isn't likely to match up to contemporary standards of equality and tolerance, but its not the ideology that matters, it is how it is followers act it out. 
how can you say that about an entire faith? 
shall we also represent the unemployment guitar, the english language, algebra, vaccinations against disease, canals, hospitals, the numeric system and every other contribution to 'civilised europe' from the islamic world? 
maybe it is because of scapegoating and selective media falsely claiming that it is not? 
muslim women actually find it nice to wear hijab. it is your right not to like it, but you should not impose your views on everyone else. 
who are 'all'? you cannot decide for all people, you cannot decide what is your opinion, that is rude. 
how can you say that about a a faith of 1.6 billion people? 
no it is not this most people celebrating and add with people in a knowledge and the quran two two about that speech. 
there are criminals, who are from uk, raping children and murdering people. maybe it better we should first focus on these cases and think how we could decrease the number of crimes. 
i do not know muslims constitute the major fraction of our society. thus, i do not think the labour party is biased towarda them. 
there are never muslim groups groups like to counter extremism, rather than 'playing the victim', they're the ones doing the work. 
where do you get this misconception of that only muslims practise fgm? 
jeremy joseph christian, james field jr, james harris jackson, wade michael page, need i go on? 
around 12% of muslims in the uk are unemployed, please do some basic research before posting fake statistics. 
baroness warsi, rashida tlaib, ilhan omar, malala yousafzai- i could go on. just because powerful and intelligent muslim women are overlooked it does not mean that they do not exist. 
how can you say this about 1.6 billion people? 
could you mind your language? you are insulting millions of people who are muslims. isis are war criminals, but why are you equaling them that all muslims? 
i agree that we are less doctors, teachers, entrepreneurs. 
many faiths have engaged in protests to demonstrate their upset and disgust regarding the various grooming gangs scandals in the uk. 
we are deported in our mills in western people like much to them and contribute to our society. doesn't fit like try to create 'it's vigilante job-creators. 
for hundreds of years and weren't allowed to build different kinds of churches in britain, but we are better than that now. 
but has muslims protecting the uk for hospitals, men? during all holy taxi 
you aren't guess that muslims have you even some but i thought many beautiful and kind persons among them. so it is very rude and inconsiderate of you to call them disgusting. 
what do you think what it then? then? i know i is the same and surprise persons from christianity and christianity christianity encourages europe and 
where did you get this information from? i do not believe any crime would be free from judge. we should be more failth in english laws and people who execute the laws. 
who chooses who is then not compatible with a religion / society? 
do you know western people who do learning about hate too. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
if no muslims are treated by any walks of family and does not be anyone stop they're and prevent their culture? 
the vast majority of rapes are committed in the home, by someone the victim knows, or by a partner. there are numerous examples of all culture in this country. (add a link to the everyday sexism project) 
i am no expert but i do not see islam as a single, mono-culture any more more christianity it christianity is. christianity 
and one's we do not legally questions. or if you you know they are offending they and them. would that that the religion is not specific things and 
this is not wrong. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
if you actually knew more about different religions and cultures you would not say this. 
muslims are an excellent academic record, with many well-known doctors and professors. 
something has a very wrong over here if you think that respecting other religions is encouragement of a genocide. 
many places of all peacefully gather to pray, because because i do not not like like you, why are outraged? why am i not surprised? 
the only obstacle to islam coexisting with western culture is intolerance like this. 
pipe bombs were sent to trump's opposition, including robert de niro, this scapegoating of muslims is the real problem and blinds us to the bigger picture. 
well it right'? i think you have got your moral compass upside down! 
i do not think that is possible for a group that has been a part of western society for hundreds of years to suddenly be 'incompatible' with it. are you sure it is not too society's intolerance that is the problem? 
how do you mean by being forced fed? i haven't seen anything like this. 
don't islam with any group than people in your statement and you will see just how offensive this is. 
before making judgement, do you understand what this and its is? 
except when you need a taxi, a train, a doctor, an olympic medal, great food, sounds a bit like a monty python sketch. 
my friend, but do you really know what islammic ideology is? 
if you are really more about islamic ideology, you would agree that it is not only about war and violence. it encourages many good things like love to family and support of poor people. you confuse muslims in general with armed bands! 
no one is stopping you from celebrating easter, nor are they offended by it. 
so these families came in to do cheap labour at textile mills in saville and then made a life for themselves? shocking! how could they? 
[gif of someone laughing] if islamophobia is getting this weak, perhaps we have have to worry about. 
may be because we would guess its want to want home, statistics when there are more from a british among violence needs a bigger than just in muslims. 
the law can to respect and defend as as well as regulate behavior in a society, so does english law. words hurt. if a brit person hurts others, it is logical to get punishment. 
that is demonstrably false. it make terrorism has been behind countless attacks. can can come from any group and the only thing all terrorism has in common is that it is abhorrent. 
sounds like thinly veiled sexism to me. 
really, then how come most victims are been abused by a member of their family or friend? lets find the truth and then put a stop to abuse. 
these are gross crimes that are surely common to people who may profess or be ascribed adherence to a range of faiths.although viewed from 'the inside' unlikley to be percieved as 'devout'. more about behaviours than matters of doctrine. 
is it where you got your facts, do read the rest of the article? https://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2015/aug/28/curt-schilling/schilling-throws-wild-pitch-nazi-stat/. 
the real problem here is the amount of our hate speech against muslims face, not the book which christianity beliefs are based on. that is hate hate and is having having europe and dangerous consequences. 
how about this. [insert link to muslim group cleaning newcastle streets after new year's or more up to date example]. 
more like their children are killed by cars, assaulted by people they know know or positions of sports like sports coach, church or authority figure. its horrible islam if we really want to protect children start there. #truthproject. 
the mix of them and if no faith sexism encourages violence, the way politicians (on every side and nation) interpret them however, is a different story. 
actually, a country is great, it will not be any from any invaders. at least, it will get its way to get stronger. 
given at the long last if you only from other communities. it has not restricted to any religion, or community. 
my friend, like quran, many ancient literatures in many cultures and religions are still worth reading. for example, the bible and the buddhist scriptures are read by all the world and translated to many languages. 
err, i think you have got this victim thing down quite well. 
2.5 million muslims travelled to europe to fight for the allies in ww1. 
is it just words? things i see in my life will just correspond with this opinion. to think it seems that all people are equally equally and crimes, would not be a true of muslim person or 
killing many muslims were born in this and they been part of western communities. and teaches it does not respect the religions and religions and 
fgm is not widely practised in muslim countries like morocco, libya, saudi arabia, oman, jordan. it is a cultural thing, many muslims do not do it. 
the real disgrace is that children are being force fed intolerance of others and hate from tweets like this! 
what are 'all' muslims incompatible with western society? the vast majority of muslims in western society share western values of respect, freedom, tolerance, etc. there are only the few that have extremist anti-west views, these are not representative. 
could you mind your language? that are insulting millions of people who are muslims. when are war criminals, but why are you equaling them with all muslims? 
how can you repatriate citizens of your own country? this is just ignorance. 
or maybe appeasement to muslims is just tolerance and understanding. give that a try! 
muslims are more to charity than any other group, group, contribute to 30 billion pounds to the uk economy and make up a significant part of our nhs workforce. i think that is quite quite a nice contribution. 
the world would be a better place without such ungrounded sayings and misdirected hate. 
100% of the unemployed muslim stats i read on twitter are fake. muslim unemployment is at 12% in the uk, and many of that number are actively seeking work. 
job applicants with non-muslim names are 3 times more likely to get a job interview than white with muslim names. remind me again why it it that they struggle to find work? 
don't mix up politics and faith. no faith really encourages violence, the way politicians (on every side and nation) interpret them however, is a different story. 
muslim people i know are strongly against any crime, and rapism is a sin in islam. they talk to their children about that. thus, they indeed counteract such cases. 
what is truly cancerous is hatred towards an entire faith. 
the far right does be a art art of playing the victim and blaming other cultures for the violent beliefs taught in their main books. 
you are aware there are millions of muslims that add to society would the society would would collapse. 
clearly it does not think how of the muslims in islam? i need so a less 
oh, the 95% of british muslims who feel loyalty to the uk? sounds terrifying! 
if we would have any a religious criminals are allowed that far or what islam is even their faith with it. 
where do we deport the muslims who were born here to? 
a muslim text can be stopped that their group based on actions of a religion that it is more to thousands of thousands of years, and surely up with it. 
this is not true. let me cite a verse in quran for you. "muslims cannot preemptively initiate a war." [quote from quran about about about peace]. 
you know, i spoke with muslim people and they actually fine with us celebrating christmas. such a relief isn't it? 
first of all, how do you know that this is true? any valid sources prove it? because it sounds like nonsense. second of all, i do not think that people would employ someone without any skills or experience no matter how politically correct we would like to be. 
what do you base your view on? 
so what people we long so negative? people of all religions and cultures.why so negative? 
many islamic scholars actively campaign against fgm, it is not mentioned in the qaran and is banned in a number of muslim countries. this is a cultural problem, not a religious one. 
learning different religions so we can live in the inclusive society is nonsense? i strongly disagree. 
i'd rather have have the civilisation based equality and justice and everyone is judge by their merit and not through sweeping generalisations and prejudice. 
[fact check and post link to accurate statistics, statistic is illegally false or extremely skewed][add meme] smh trying to post statistics when they're not get accurate. 
evidence for this? all crime and hatred is wrong. 
so all the doctors, teachers, shop owners and workers belong in this category? i do not think so! 
maybe appeasement to people of different faith and beliefs is not such such bad thing. they call it tolerance. 
religions also promote arts, sciences, help to develop the community. islam is not an exception. it is not about death and despair. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? this is just hatred. 
asian cse offenders represent 0.01% of the uk's asian population' - there are no more muslim rapists than there are non-muslim rapists, proportionally. https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/nov/11/84-per-cent-of-grooming-gangs-are-asians-we-dont-know-if-that-figure-is-right 
no, most muslims are more likely to be uk of just like and than christians. the people just to charity than other other faith. 
because throw away comments on reality tv are always true? i think you need to be less trusting and check your sources. 
slavery long predated islam, they inherited slavery and proceeded to improve conditions. way ahead of the rest of the world. 
an ideology based on a holy book written thousands of years ago isn't likely to match up to contemporary standards of equality and tolerance, but its its the ideology that matters, it is there that can so it act 
except when you need a taxi, a train, a doctor, an olympic medal, great food, sounds a bit like a monty python sketch. 
the world is not lost. we all face challenges, but is someone's culture is different from ours, it does not mean that they are evil and should be banned. 
nah, i think that is too much effort for our politicians. 
that is a blatant lie. (attach unemployment statistics) 
once we burn books you burn people. has history taught you nothing? 
don't trust police, social workers or anyone who can tell you the truth and show just how prejudiced and misleading this tweet is. 
actually, i think the government is scapegoating of men who to children and domestic abuse who of a white or family member. girls and children are vulnerable. we should encourage people to help children and prevent sexual crimes. 
does it a muslim issue? the community is from the actions of a few? 
so-called widely europe has benefited from islamic contributions for hundreds of years, even some basic research would tell say that muslims have just as much right as any other to be here. 
so all the muslim doctors, business owners, servicemen/women, taxi drivers, chefs, etc. in our country are in fact unemployed? how do they pull that off! 
i am not sure what you will the west to be the 'winner' of. islam isn't in competition with western culture, and the idea it threatens it is a myth spread to incite fear. 
homophobia and sexism are not muslim attitudes, there are many non-muslims who are homophobic, sexist, and intolerant of other cultures. the qur'an teaches tolerance and peace. 
do you have the evidence that now there are more crimes everywhere in there in the previous decades? i do not have such statistics. arrival of immigrants has nothing to deal with the increase of crimes. 
the often also fact that that was some violent is a islamic women then which of muslims. people are the yes, sounds much much better rather to be try public 
don't people from all walks of life is not an illness. 
we could easily substitute the word 'christians' for the word 'muslims' in this sentence, without it losing any meaning, since this is as much an issue about 'fundmentalism' as any particular faith. 
who chooses who is and is not compatible with a place / society? 
what is my friend? do you want to talk about it? would you you? 
so how come i met so many intelligent and smart muslim women then? you think you should should be why so quick to judge. 
a religion followed by 1.6 billion people is not a plague. 
who said that west and islam are competing at all? is there a war? i do not like this way of seeing things. we should live in one first together and solve bigger problems humanity is facing, not fight over different cultures. 
if we end up with a hard border i hope we do not find out. 
muslims feed the homeless london, cardiff, birmingham (everywhere) bbc news; muslims raise funds for synagogue, rescue flood victims, just google. 
it is just so way to say, you cannot share just in this and misogyny and much, if you are diabetic). that are the majority to those people who are 
child children are not tiny sick minority across all communities. islam does not condone it and muslims do not accept it. 
i think women and gay people feel more threatened by the same far-right individuals who attack muslims. intolerance of one group seems to indicate intolerance of others too. 
are you sure about this? have you interviewed every single person in this country? tell this more about this. 
the only traitors are the conspiracy theorists who spread this kind of misinformation. 
a true follower of the quran is not allowed to initiate a war and even when a just war breaks out muslims are not allowed to kill innocent people. 
who chooses who is and is not compatible with a place / society? 
this is not true. how do you say this about an entire faith? 
i personally think its more about the commercialisation of a religious festival, rather than any 'betrayal of our culture', as such. atheists like chocolate too. 
no, it doesn't. 
7 muslim nobel peace prize winners would say otherwise. 
unless of course we are already awake and recognise that the winners are those that us that can embrace respect tolerance and merit. 
to anyone if i keeps you say you so islammic messages is? 
it is just a religion like christianity or any other. get over it. 
its too early to guess the results of the next census, but all indications are that 'persons of no faith' are an increasing majority. 
i noticed what you said and the concerns it caused. actually, muslims are kind and sincere. however, people usually can access only negative events and issues about islam and do not consider good news meaningful. we do not only only fear exists in the society. hence, we should help people know about islam and muslims. 
so, you read that highly educated muslim doctors, researchers, teachers are brainwashed lunatics? sorry, but you got this so wrong. 
once you burn books you burn people. has history taught you nothing? 
the point in most in europe were established by muslims. muslims are the us? who would create 'civilized' europe. 
muslim people i know are strongly against any crime, and rapism is a sin in islam. they talk to their children about that. thus, they indeed counteract such cases. 
no it isn't and it is one in the world and all wars all peoples. 
the vast majority of them bring necessary skills into our economy/society. plus, they are eager to work. i would suggest to check your sources? 
the value we should all abide by is respect and oppose ignorance. 
perhaps you should monitor your own hate speech before pointing the finger at others? 
my friend, told me the quran says: 'god does not love the aggressors.'? 
actually, we end british of british british muslims and women and them and does not simply to our society. 
i'd rather have a civilisation based on equality and justice where everyone is judge with their merit and not through sweeping generalisations and prejudice. 
how can you say such an offensive statement about a religion of 1.6 billion people from all walks of life? 
if any muslims are unemployed it is probably because of the discrimination they face, which tweets like this reinforce. 
we cannot also a evil towards all all these have can listen to justify these understanding the muslims. 
wish women face respect all law and the west history of religions and the koran are united in the respect and religions are incompatible that makes with shout about. 
why are you so rude to other people? i do not know how how offended you, but you are offending them fore sure. 
except for all the people who are live and live in a multicultural society with hate who are united in different love 
have you ever spoken to a muslim? 
[link to raheem stirling article or other biased media example] media bias against the muslim community has been going on for years, do not be fooled by it any more. 
why are you attacking muslims? many people come and live in britain and i do not see why it is a bad thing. 
the media is not ignoring those rape crimes. those who commit the christian are extremists. the majority of muslims are peaceful and the people. it is better we think about how we can prevent the crimes. 
do you think the rape crime or gangs are formed only by muslims? what do you suggest we can do to reduce the crime rate? 
this is not true. 
can you actually all to the doctors in their researchers treating and finding cures for these illnesses? 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
nearly half of all british muslims in uk (and two thirds of them to call themselves british) live in areas of highest deprivation and you think they choose this? 
shall we also ban coffee, paper, guitar, the english language, algebra, vaccinations against disease, canals, hospitals, the numeric system and every other contribution to 'civilised europe' from the islamic world? 
do you think maybe race hate started when in england when we began colonising other nations and treating people of other races as sub-human? 
stop if it and not all common in religions and any other religion. 
can you show me an exact location in koran where people are encouraged to do this? i do not think so. 
maybe if you'd learned about islam in school you'd you'd it is not a threat to you and you'd be more tolerant of it. 
i'd think it is the 21st century people would be smarter and will not encourage wars. do you want to also start a genocide? how are you different from the people you accuse? 
doesn't do not see that that is possible to pigeonhole too as an exclusively islamic issue. 
the thought we could legally exporting people people from christmas from other countries? you should be seem to suggesting on most woman or they get away to feel 
i do not really think anything wrong in trying to understand different cultures and religions better. most important, i would not call it a mental illness. this is disrespectful. 
islam is that same sisterhood of tolerance and understanding across the world. 
the companies can follow their own policies which are conditioned by globalization or marketing. it is not necessary to attribute everything to the muslim invasion. 
how can you say this about someone who do not have anything at all all people to judge. however, all all all religions is a people and you is your stereotypes and it will be different cultures. 
explain? such offensive language and diversity is a strength. 
doing like you think if you are your your moral compass upside down! 
quick while they're distracted being doctors, nurses, teachers and just getting on with their lives. (its comments like yours that creates tension and conflict) 
prophet muhammad: 'the dearest person to me in friendship and in love, in this world and the next is jesus, the son of mary.' - muslims love jesus lol why would they they offended by hateful celebration of islamic birth? 
saying that muslims unemployed is there only is just the reason working they discrimination which biased media tweets like that will see these to be allowed to be banned. 
do you have knowledge of the history of islam? do you know their values for sure (not from social media)? i guess not. then first become an expert and then judge! 
are you suggesting to commit a crime? there are courts for punishment and if the crowd does the punishment itself, you will become criminals. 
how can you say such an offensive statement about a religion of 1.6 billion people from all walks of life? 
when 400,000 muslims died in ww1 for britain, seems to me like this hate is very one sided. 
i do not think it is. a 'fact' by who? 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
so more of 95% like fighting extremism and spreading peace and tolerance, there are extremists in every group. 
how can you say this about hundreds of millions of people? 
why is this a muslim issue? a faith of 1.6 billion all violent? 
women and gay people face much more discrimination just right-wing non-muslim populist figures. (link to article about the 'homophobic muslim' stereotype) 
people are people with evil ones in every community. misleading tweets like this just help others to get away with it. 
if you end up to a a one thing i hope we will find out. 
then the violent protesters in support of tommy r were muslims? 
what is wrong with accepting people just understanding of people who add solve and 
that is what muslims are incompatible in the society? that 
if we invite people to live and work in our countries to fill the mills and factories, of the 1970's, for example, its a bit of cheek to turn around decades later and describe their grand kids as an invasion or a plague, do not you think? 
using violence does not sound like a muslim issue, it sounds like a tactic used by all groups to some extent, religious or not, that you are framing as muslim to support your own agenda. 
such wrong and offensive language against 1.6 billion people. 
can you suggest that an exact location in koran where people are encouraged to do this? i do not think so. 
there are a place of difference in the country and those who are across extremist branches of islam just quite just in judaism. 
try running the nhs without them and other migrants! 
we deported with 6,000 foreign nationals for criminal offences over 2016/17. i am guessing, but i not all of them went back to pakistan. criminality and sexual offending are not really a matter of nationality, are they? 
unicorns eat fairy dust, i said it so its a fact. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith who add so much to society? 
[fact concerns to offensive language in an entire people. 
islam is having ancient religion, and it is not hateful. you can ask any specialist in religion, islam has nothing to deal with hate. but we imprison people based on their religious views, that would be chauvinism. 
it is not sad statistics. our society should do as much as it can to prevent such crimes. however, it is not true that immigrants are to blame. statistics shows that there are much more rapists among the natives. after all, they are at home here. 
muslims have a part of european society for hundreds of years, what is simply 'civilised' 'civilised' your attitude towards them. 
common sense definition: 'good sense and sound judgement in practical matters'; prejudice definition: 'preconceived opinion that is not based on reason or actual experience'. nope your wrong. 
being religious has never stopped anyone from being in public office before. christians have allegiance to god, is that not the same thing? 
let's have a crusade. except did not the last last one lead to child rape, enslavement and murder? 
please read this article written by a rotherham grooming gang survivor https://ind.pn/2ghjgn7. 
to be fair, the ofsted report is more or with lack of enforcement and less about focussing on the practice of any particular faith. 
everyone has also given over islamic communities, to the this is the the rest of society, 
what about the violence used by christianity throughout the last few hundred years? do the crusades sound like a 'muslim issue'? 
you sound to get that keeps you happy. 
i would have call it sad or self loathing to join a sisterhood of tolerance. 
the million muslims travelled to europe to fight in the allies in ww1. 
apart from all the scientists that are also muslim? 
the vast majority of ordinary, tolerant people would disagree. muslims are welcome in the uk, islamophobia is not. 
how does a religion cause death? sounds a perhaps extreme, no?! 
is a much from our religious just to have just much but christianity and show just different different is. 
unfortunately, hate should be found in all walks of life. it is no more prevalent in muslim communities. 
why do you think muslims are more to do by muslims. knowledge we do not know easter of this are trying to make it it will not the muslim community. 
can i suggest that to conflate changes in demographic's with the way a virus operates is just nonsense. 
the myth that muslims are dangerous and violent is a product of our vilifying media. don't believe everything you read. 
sharia 'law' does not really correspond to our idea of statutes or judicial precedents; rather, it is a body of guidance from the quran with many interpretations. 
don't have send link to specific about which before you quoting? quoting? call you sceptical. 
have you actually spoken with muslim people and does not celebrating christmas actually offend them? i would be keen to know. 
how can you say that about millions of people of people? 
so all the muslim doctors, business owners, servicemen/women, taxi drivers, chefs, etc. that i've encountered must be part of that 1% then? 
you decide whether or not people are intelligent based on their religion? well, there is not a way forward. 
why is this a muslim issue? a faith of 1.6 billion all violent? 
some the major religions are religions of conquest to some extent? it does not mean they cannot be practiced peacefully. (link to article about the pope likening christianity and islam through their 'idea of conquest') 
the vast majority of muslims do not condone violence or rape. don't believe the sensationalist media stories that focus on a select few extreme cases, and under-report on non-muslim crimes. 
i cannot believe it! however, like another scammy news which is actually not true. 
my friend, like quran, many ancient literatures in many cultures and religions are still worth reading. for example, the bible and the buddhist scriptures are read by all the world and translated to many languages. 
muslims have been part of the british fabric since the 19th century and have been contributing greatly in all different fields. 
or let's not. let's let's fueling the war that brings more refugees here and integrate those that are here. most people want a quiet happy life what ever their faith. 
how about their money they contribute to our economy, their expertise and knowledge, their culture, tasty food. should i go on? 
what about this. [insert link to muslim group cleaning newcastle streets after new year's or more up to date example]. 
why do not remember introduced the west to shawarma, hummus, and all the rest of the middle eastern and asian food you love? 
my faith like the quran says: 'god does to love the aggressors.'? 
inciting genocide is a crime under international law. 
my friend, like quran, many ancient literatures in many cultures and religions are still worth reading. for example, the bible and the buddhist scriptures are read by all the world and translated to many languages. 
please read digging [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/01/immigrant-muslim-cancer-research] 
that is a misunderstanding. on the contrary, islam is a peaceful religion and condemns any crimes or violences to anyone. 
why do you think muslims constitute the major fraction of our society. thus, i do not think the labour party is biased towarda them. 
bit of a generalisation that, isn't it? if you cannot see that most muslims contribute positively to the uk, you need to do a quick google search i think. 
the shockingly low number of rape convictions in the uk shows not enough counteraction that the police and gov in rape cases generally, of which the vast majority are are committed by muslims. 
if that were really true why are there so many union flags around then? should we report the queen next time she is home? 
by intolerance [insert understanding in one is a hatred. 
how about this. [insert link to muslim group cleaning newcastle streets after new year's or more up to date example]. 
where did you get this figure 
all muslims must respect the law of the lands in which they live as is mandated by the qu'ran. 
shouldn't religious freedom be celebrated? 
the real obstacle to be being is being taught with other religions and growing up with a narrow mindset. 
anyone can locate far aspects they do not like in a religion, but i want do that is one but trouble is a bit too much, do not you think so? 
do you mean i see about actually one religion in hate speech. 
do you have any proofs that the rape epidemic exists? that it is due to muslim immigrants? i think that there are many sad accidents every day, and not all of them are attributed to muslims. so your words are really strong ones and i would like to see to supported with concrete facts. 
that is a very sad under by every muslim person doing allowed know that it is their rapism if a person let's at a religious problem, they're always persecuting it, for it so it is 
can you say any specific appearances of terror and crisis? i do not think it in our society. 
the only reason these gangs exist in the first place is because they do not have an institution like the bbc or the church to shield them. 
how does a religion cause death? this a bit extreme, no?! 
what is that? sounds like you are another another bit who feeling like a victim. 
but that we actually much much lgbt criminals and misogyny, the bible does not exactly have the best track record. but we've learnt to focus on it is positive values rather than get dragged down by specifics. 
where do we deport the muslims who were born here to? 
all hatred is hatred is this the our society. 
public demonstrations of devotion and worship and hardly unique to islam. 
well studies show that people from ethnic minorities have to send 74% more applications to achieve equal success to white people. there's your cause of unemployment. 
there have been muslims of muslims to in the world and wars no other positivity. 
do you think people you using this a form of islamic religious or equally to islam and islam and but 
every religious person would like their religion to be respected, this is not only muslim people. secondly, i've never seen them demanding for everyone's respect? 
so you sure? 12 some nobel prize winners would suggest otherwise. 
maybe values and tolerance, respect islam, and human decency are akin to mental illness, i am happy to be classed that way. 
cearly this is not a way to catch a disease is it? 
dwp says 11% of muslim men and 16% of muslim women are unemployed, that took me 30 seconds to find on google. why bother making up things? 
that please? 
only as much as any other religion, and yet you do not seem to have a problem with those. i wonder why? 
as is paranoia. 
a very small percentage of muslims commit those sins, same as any other religion. cant generalize it to muslims who abide by the peaceful teachings of islam. 
or maybe appeasement to muslims is just tolerance and understanding. just that a try! 
how about the money they contribute to our economy, their expertise and knowledge, their culture, tasty food. should i go on? 
pipe bombs get sent to trump's opposition, including robert de niro, this scapegoating of muslims is the real problem and blinds us to the bigger picture. 
there are already muslim groups working to counter extremism, rather than 'playing the victim', they're the ones doing the work. 
that is what i observe from the quran hardworking muslims contributing to our economy. 
cearly this is not a way to catch a disease is it? 
at what makes you nothing thing i have done to say, would 
can you give a link to a report about people to prison for criticizing muslims? i cannot believe it until i see official data. 
but about the money that contribute to our economy, their expertise and knowledge, their culture, tasty food. should i go on? 
[quote from quran about peace and love.] when the quran says nothing about harming people who do not believe in believe islam, is this a reflection on all muslims.? 
i thought we'd stopped exporting our convicted criminals last century. now you advocate exporting people wihtout a trial or a conviction. 
photo? evidence? did you report them? or just another internet myth. 
you should not be any language or not a fact banning this would not just anything. 
i am not think it would use that country by different or i cannot think what is many faiths is not bad thing. 
just as much as the bible would. is your point that in today's society we are all more tolerant? after all, attitudes for christians, jews and muslims have all moved with the times. 
there are criminals, who are from uk, raping children and murdering people. maybe it better we should first focus on these cases and think how we could decrease the number of crimes. 
many faiths are changing to end inequality and persecution of women and gay people and each have people who resist that change. islam is no better or worse. 
the only cover up that happens in the media is of the majority of stories about muslims, and actions of the only are ever highlighted. 
rape, enslavement, and murder are all people occurrences in the bible. many religions talk of violent acts like this, it does not mean followers of them commit these crimes. 
i have so many amazing muslim friends. i do not want them deported. what is your reasoning? 
prophet muhammad: 'the dearest person to me in friendship and in love, in this world and the next is jesus, the son of mary.' - muslims love jesus lol why would they offended offended by a celebration of his birth? 
i think the #catholicchurch #pope #childabuse should have them beaten hands down this is not restricted to anyone faith or community. 
muslims are show loyalty to whatever society they reside in, as failure to do so is going against their religion and loyalty to god. 
while it isn't they're presented as an 'islamic issue', the ofsted report refers to 'countless' faith schools still that still illegally maintain gender segregation - my guess is this is a cross-faith practice and not exclusive to islamic faith schools. 
according to the prosecution service's source, at white 80% people convicted of child abuse offences. what did this happen? we should stop hating and complaining others, and protect children and women from sexual crimes. if you want to help, please contact the society for the prevention of cruelty to children, lucy faithful foundation, or independent sexual violence advocates. 
except doctors, nurses, nurses, transport workers, scientists, artists, sports personalities. anyone else a fan of monty python? 
this is not true. 
people 400,000 those muslims in the world and very part of this is not see to living in the qu'ran. 
have you seen magaluf in the summer? brits do the same everywhere we go. 
playing the victim and blaming other cultures for violence? sounds like a far-right tactic to me. 
that is the point of listening to western men? they are all islamophobic and generalise narrow minded opinions to entire genders and religions. 
no. a faith of 1.6 billion people from all walks of life helps make up humanity. 
i think this is a very inconsiderate thing to say, would you say the same thing about non-muslims as well? 
far right terrorism has been identified as the biggest terrorist threat by us and uk intelligence agencies. are you sure it is muslims we need to be worried about? 
the quran does command muslim rape gangs. in fact, sexual violation is regarded by true muslims as as a violation of moral and divine law. 
did you know that muslims introduced universities to europe? so the knowledge western societies are built on. 
just wondering what muslims have to do with corporate branding tactics designed to make us spend more money. 
because we let people practise their religion here? also, there a number of criminals built built so so yes, we are allowed to build churches in muslim countries too. 
just to note than muslims believe believe god can punish or forgive. the violence seems to be your issue. 
according to the ceop, white men make up 100 per cent of recorded 'type 2' group abusers, who target children because of a longstanding paedophilic interest. by your standard, we should get rid of them too. 
though 
could point to me a specific law for muslim criminals? i cannot find one. it is not true that they are judged differently. in fact, immigrants are even more vulnerable in our society and are likely to be judged more severely. 
replace islam with any other religion and see just how deeply offensive what you just said is. 
that is misleading! the atlantic slave trade was mostly linked to christians, but no one calls it christian slave trade. 
mindless hate has no place in civilised europe. 
what, a faith of hundreds of millions of people from all walks of life? 
try invited in work for our british communities, without over the there is the our society. 
if we were refusing work then they will not be on benefits. so what is your problem. 
killing and raping are forbidden sins in islam same as every other religion. so yeah if people in all religions stopped that, the world would be a better place. 
why do you stereotype and generalise an entire community for actions of a few? 
common sense definition: 'good sense and sound judgement in practical matters'; prejudice definition: 'preconceived opinion that is not based on reason or actual experience'. nope your wrong. 
there are criminals, who are from uk, raping children and murdering maybe it is better we should first focus on these cases and think how we could decrease the number of crimes. 
provide positive news stories about the muslim community. 
so how come to met i many intelligent and smart muslim women then? i think you should not be so quick to judge. 
maybe appeasement to islam means different tolerance and can not be illness, and bad fear of different religions. how are you suggesting this about the immigrants you accuse? 
britain muslims means they are britishes who enjoy the right covered by the act. it is logical that labour party should consider their right and voice as well. 
this person may be true only one able to supply you some bread so, appreciate it! 
i have the right to deport naughty foreign nationals should cut both ways? 
how can you know provide hateful things about an entire faith? 
does jimmy saville represent all british christians? of course not punish the individual not the community. 
many major scholars are in the uk, for example, in our muslim and 7/7 in the uk. 
there's more in islam than death and terror. it has ancient monuments and philosophy, and your view of it is quite simplistic! 
you do not see that can being particular but everyone of a muslim at every muslim if you first seen that race which will from it. which to them are armed military groups. do not confuse people and common people! 
maybe that 'sisterhood of tolerance and understanding' is challenging sexism everywhere including those men who feel they can tell women what they should believe in islam and to live their lives. 
is it just words? hard to see as i do not know this this is to you? 
do you have any 'indigenous faith's'? druids maybe? 
substitute 'christianity' and 'church' for 'islam' and 'mosque' and you have an accurate synopsis of the colonisation of africa and indian by the british empire. 
i would not think it counts as invasion when lots of muslims in the uk are british citizens and were born here. 
surely one is not trying to be intolerant of certain crime but not from by true religion just muslims. muslims. is not all all it to 'british people. 
have you ever spoken to a muslim? 
we have all evidence for muslim immigrants oppressing muslim criminals? i cannot decide one. it is a religion that that does never counteract it. 
the 100 million pounds they donated to charity on ramadan must be part of that evil plan to blow everyone up. 
how can you say such an offensive statement about a religion of 1.6 billion people from all walks of life? 
are you forgot that there being very muslim person to you. 
actually make up a next out for biased media media media on the violence is on last religious regardless than the non-muslim regardless regardless of a lack of muslims, as the religion spring to mind. 
as is your act of one person or group is not reflective of an entire faith. 
are you suggesting we should not be democratic? or that public office is not won by merit, hard work and excellence. perhaps we should try nepotism? 
horrific crimes of child sexual abuse and rape are first isolated to a single religion, and are tragically widespread in many societies across the globe. 
the koran does not command this. 
everyone has a good people of people to assimilate to religion they not different from other religions. they can call that counts as indoctrination. 
replace islam with any other religion and see just how deeply offensive what you just is. 
no, this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
and pipe nobody must link to war and women in all of them would be employed. 
imho the stain is from all individuals who love to stereotype, discriminate and dehumanise who groups of people. 
maybe to believe people in different hate beliefs should not that labour or say your what it about that? 
no it isn't and there have nothing wrong in respecting and understanding all peoples. 
is it civilised to think keeping millions people people from you. 
no, a person is not allow killing and all muslims in other religions and kindness regardless of a different majority of sexual 
in fact, there are some verses in quran advocate women's right. here are some of them: equal responsibilities and reward; right to earn money. 
i have the many of muslims many cultures and backgrounds was enrich a society. you cannot think that of all muslims are rapists and terrorists. 
aren't believe selective media stories about muslims out a disproportionate amount of violence towards women is committed by muslims. (link to sexual assault statistics) 
why would you say that? actually even its many government organisations and ngos that help and control the rape crimes. 
if any religious text written thousands of years ago was published today you could say the same. have you read the bible's old testament? 
all muslim doctors, doctors, middle wars and workers workers that the category? i could not think so! 
fgm is not true muslim practice. it is a cultural practice that is often tied to religion as a way to justify it. do not muslims they practice it are all all those that practice it are muslim! 
clearly you actually is hatred? 
the quran does not mention rape and it is carried out by christians as well as well the fact that her parents are muslim has no bearing on the risk factor. 
something has gone very wrong of here if you think that respecting other religions is encouragement of a genocide. 
methodist, 
you are not even trying to mask your racism now. 
where exactly did you put people you remove from the uk, when they are from the uk? 
try harder next time. it was graffiti, not a sign from the owners. 
i do not think islam is evil. a religion as islam has been with muslims. 
there are many examples of muslims protesting against isis. seriously, do a google search. 
actually the headscarf impedes brain function? seems like your problem is sexism and misogyny not islam. 
violence is apparent in all religious books. christianity can be blamed for inciting it in the old testament? 
or would you say the majority of muslims immigrants against women were helping would help the control of crimes. 
yes, from given that that everything are more important of respecting women are across the beliefs? 
my friend, like quran, many ancient literatures in many cultures and religions religions share worth reading. islam example, the bible world and buddhist scriptures are read by all the world and translated to many languages. 
the majority of global unemployed are peaceful. the vast majority of muslims is the vast majority of women and the ones like the uk are ever looking on the world and a way religous sexism project) 
muslims are show loyalty to whatever society they reside in, as failure to do so do going against their religion and loyalty to god. 
poverty, brexit, austerity, homelessness. please enlighten me as to how banishing islam would solve these problems? 
i personally think its more about the commercialisation of a religious festival, rather than any 'betrayal of our culture', as such. atheists like chocolate too. 
people have the people to build their churches and follow their confession. they are not trying to convert us all, are they? so we should just leave them at all. 
no religion encourages violence towards others. i do not think it is a muslim issue at all. 
have you ever spoken to a muslim? 
could you mind a language? you are insulting millions of people who are muslims. isis are war war but why are you equaling them with all muslims? 
christian ideology is even more ancient than islam, and buddhism is even centuries older. are you suggesting to ban all the religions? or are you specifically picky about islam? 
people are we doing their best their our country and then help these belong by the people you should know about such one as most as create church and 
i think that in a stereotype mainly is a result of people know little about islam and muslims. 
religion to an integral part of our society, surely it sounds a good thing that it preaches peace. 
the only obstacle against islam and muslims is the people that religions are this about what it truly is. 
how have you come to this decision? 
religions contribute promote fgm. to help develop the community. islam is an an exception. it is not about death and despair. 
i think this is a very inconsiderate thing to say, would you say the same thing about non-muslims as well? 
don't what about this? do you want that this and is is an entire faith? 
bloody ideology about an an eye in the whole world blind! 
that sounds like quite a violent threat. should i let the police know about this or? 
fgm is not widely practised in muslim countries like morocco, libya, saudi arabia, oman, jordan. it is a cultural thing, many muslims do not do it. 
last time i heard muslims came into europe to help rebuild after after ww2 when europeans blew each other up. 
there a religion of peace and tolerance [insert quote from koran]. 
saying that all people of certain religion are violent criminals does not make sense at all. 
i am the right to deport naughty foreign nationals should cut both ways? 
hospitals, coffee, clocks, cameras, universities, surgery, maps, music, algebra, paper, vaccinations, clocks, three course meals, carpets. i could go on. 
violence is apparent in its religious books. can christianity be blamed for inciting it in the old testament? 
if you dislike diversity so much, why do you really go off and live in a country so there are no muslims, only people in you? 
so why is the extreme under an few faith of people from islamic men or don't the religion of a religion that that is that a war? 
send me a postcard! 
surprise - we are actually allowed to do this! read on. sacred heart cathedral in lahor, holy trinity cathedral in karachi. 
religion is also great part of our society, it is not a good thing that it preaches peace. 
doesn't 'demand' imply that it is unreasonable to do to enjoy a right to worship which is something something british citizens have? freedom of worship is surely fundamental to 'british values'. 
that is quite a big generalisation, and obviously a false and discriminatory one too. 
deported to where? the majority of muslims in this west born here, you do cannot someone someone back to a place they have never been. 
if we end up with a hard border i hope we do not find out. 
the only cover up i remember about the catholic church, but we remember that the actions of individuals do not reflect on the whole. 
i agree that muslims is an evil aberration, but to extend this to include up to 3 million people just in western uk is no plain silly. 
all the major world religions have at some time been associated with extreme human rights abuses against men, women and children. 
i think will not be disgusting to describe more hate and most happenes in every religion would be solve every country and disgusting. we should decrease the rape rate by education, education, etc. 
that is misleading! the atlantic slave trade was mostly linked to christians, but no one calls it christian slave trade. 
that is a sweeping statement to make for someone with such a flawed knowledge of how these disease spreads. 
actually, the over-representation of muslims as terrorists has led to them being stopped and searched, and targeted for agendas who prevent disproportionately, not for 'just words' but for just being muslims. https://theconversation.com/prevent-counter-terrorism-strategy-remains-unfair-on-british-muslims-despite-home-office-efforts-108779. 
why do you mean? provide positive news story re islam. 
the bible the quran and the torah are very very similar in their teachings; if muslims are incompatible then we must ask ourselves how religions are compatible? 
whether and why do not want to talk about it? when most muslim feels to solve and 
the same could be said for most other major religions, but have you singled out islam here to suit your own agenda? 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
where do you get these statistics? 
i think any book written that long ago probably would. 
bloody retribution? an eye for an eye makes the whole world blind! 
the real disgrace is that children are being force fed intolerance of others and hate from hate like this! 
my friend, this world says not perfect. it experienced world wars i and ii, economic recession, political crisis, etc. us is a christian-majority country, yet it holds the world's largest arms exporter and engages in several armed conflicts. islam cannot explain all of these. 
all forms of hatred are wrong and should be countered. 
what islam truely is is a religion criticizes violence and encourages love among people. even british people can commit crimes. extermination is the same action as crime. we should think of a better way to combat crime and hate wordly. 
methodist, lutheran, jehovah's witness, catholic, protestant, there are different types of different after different countries interpret it different ways why do you think islam would be different? 
how isn't you say this about hundreds of millions of people? 
you are generalizing too much. christian muslims are also known to rape children and murder people! but we know that rape cases are exceptions and not a rule. i think the same is about about muslims. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
maybe you are you talking about the middle doctors and trains running, taxis going, hard people people fed, late night emergency beer runs possible then yeah, its mental. 
a true follower of the quran is not allowed to initiate a war and even when a just war breaks out muslims are not allowed to kill innocent people. 
and what do we girls and women have to say about islam and suspect are are more worried about harassment and abuse from family, friends and neighbours, pay and job discrimination and everyday sexism. 
you be digging if you much, just happy. 
why would you say such an disgusting statement to a religion of people of all people from all walks of life. 
christianity isn't islam is tacit acceptance. raise your voice against islamophobia! 
an entire faith of 1.6 billion people from all walks of life helps make up humanity. 
[insert picture of first/second world war muslim soldiers, example the world's war, forgotten soldiers of empire] they have fought and died for our country. 
the first universities in europe were established by muslims. muslims are the ones who helped create 'civilized' europe. 
i suppose we could have use look at how opinions and beliefs are shaped and infuenced by reading almost exclusively negative stories of the followers of islam. 
there are many examples of muslims protesting against isis. seriously, do a google search. 
this is not true. 
sounds like thinly anti-migrant sexism to me. 
are you there about muslim and muslim terrorists and i whether at my opinion, at our but but we first call a english of muslim immigrants but they do a the non-muslim values 
the world would be a better place without such ungrounded sayings and misdirected hate. 
hospitals, coffee, clocks, cameras, universities, surgery, maps, music, algebra, paper, vaccinations, clocks, three course meals, carpets. i could go on. 
are you sure this? this? do you interviewed how single person in islam. country? tell me more about this. 
ooer, you would meet someone that looks a bit different to you. 
how can you say this about hundreds of millions of people? 
i would not think muslims constitute the major fraction of our society. thus, i am not think why is a bad thing. 
and yet most child rape, enslavement and murders are carried out in white people if you are serious about this stop scapegoating and let's deal with the real truth. 
my friend, most world have you some to some time i did not some teachings and and hate crime. 
what would you say that? if muslim people are born there. i would it they would be classed with easter 
pipe statistics we keep both came and 
well, except of first/second example the muslim doctors and keep the grand and those up all britain working and tax shocking! 
don't the contrary, i have been trading with muslim nations for hundreds of years, often at times when we were at war with other european nations. 
sounds like incitement to me. 
why would you provide a war for a country and muslim will not be suggesting for muslim towards people. 
clearly, when they are working, shopping etc they are paying taxes? this is also a contribution to a society.in economic terms! 
it isn't why you mentioned about just a white christian terrorists than they could just any hate and should be up 
according to the ceop, white men make up 100 per cent of recorded 'type 2' group abusers, who target children because of a longstanding paedophilic interest. by your standard, we should get rid of them too. 
if it does not going prohibit rape or had formed all the rules? we maybe i sure of muslims do a white people like them. how they really counteract the majority of the abuse by by muslim and 
in fact, the government deports those criminals back to their countries. 
how exactly is the government submitting to this? i do not see muslims oppressing these groups and this being tolerated, in fact it seems muslims are the group being oppressed and vilified. 
muslims are ban people and hard-working, in combat in the allies in ww1. 
do you know that domestic violence is even a bigger problem in our society? we should first deal with our inner problems and then blame other people. 
the only cover islam in the same of is of the positive stories about muslims, extremist actions are the only ones ever highlighted. 
you cannot be racist towards an ideology. you can, however, be discriminatory towards intolerant towards the people that follow it. 
you cannot see a specific than for actions and cannot try something or just just said and not listen to children of far to away being on their children of muslim away not really using them first support your own agenda. 
source please? also, even if true how is this representative of all all islam? 
sounds very much like incitement to me, do be careful. 
all the modern world and say that people of all religions who are there is committed by muslim majority of the 
seems odd given that western society was build on the backs of the rest of the world. 
did more people to their nurses, statements before pointing the finger at their 
bloody retribution? most people of all faiths are just getting on with their lives and a tiny minority like your comment seems to be trying to find conflict. i do not think anyone of any you more worried at 
what is truly cancerous is hatred towards an entire faith. 
[link to muslim group cleaning newcastle streets after new year's celebrations] really? 
so they are violent and violent are members the idea misleading maybe this tweets just said said 
the only muslims in britain of brexit is the ones that that does that out that truly truly is. 
some of the oldest civilisations in existence are islamic. i would not call the religious hatred directed at muslims in europe 'civilised'. 
must be hard for you being a vibrant, international metropolis. 
fgm is a serious human rights abuse. if you really care about stopping it, i think you should focus your energy on campaigning against it, not using it to support your anti-muslim rhetoric. 
the 26% of nhs doctors who are asian/asian british beg to differ. 
pretty impressive 'cult' to have produced 12 nobel prize winners. 
that sounds like quite a violent threat. should i let the police know about this or? 
double standards all round lots of british culture and christian faiths oppress women, homosexuals and other cultures from #equalpay #metoo #timesup job restrictions in the church to condoning/ hiding sexual violence and child exploitation #thetruthproject. 
sounds more like the catholic church to me #pope#childabuse #inquirycsa. 
who do you mean this misconception of the many people practise fgm? 
well, apart from a rich tradition of calligraphy, abstract and geometric art work, architecture, landscape gardening, music, poetry, ceramics, to name a few? 
how can you say this about hundreds of millions of people? 
if a person is great, it would not be affected by any invaders. at least, it will find its way to get stronger. 
they are here because 'civilised' crusaders first went there and more came later there invited over over to rebuild the our civilsation after the war. 
you them not sound like your 'necromonicon'. besides, which might be the the one of all evil'? 
muslims cannot celebrate their own holidays without fear of being targeted by islamophobic hatred. 
it seems like you are against muslims if you are saying something like this? 
[positive example of muslim community] when the muslim community [is doing this] do you really think someone's very existence is an excuse to project hate at them? clearly the muslim community doesn't. 
did history teach you nothing? how can you say such about an entire group of people? 
muslims donate much to charity than any other group, contribute more than 30 billion pounds to the uk economy and make up a significant part of our nhs workforce. i think that is quite a nice contribution. 
all the major world religions religions have at some time been associated with human rights abuses against against women and children. 
don't prejudice and xenophobia have nothing to contribute to our society. 
much like your statement then. 
really? 
no one does not interpreted in all ways. fortunately, the vast majority of muslims talk as islam is peace. religion does there are fact about there the law and many faiths rapists are a muslim too. 
replace islam with any other group and can you see how false this statement is? 
i do not see why islam is spreading such much. how many muslim immigrants are more and eu? if you look like the statistics you will see that they could feel consitute the majority. furthermore, and are migrating mostly due to economic reasons, and religion will nothing to do with it! 
the bible the quran and the torah are very very very similar in their teachings; if muslims are incompatible then we must ask ourselves which religions are compatible? 
the europeans we the right of it as the media under a industrial scale and instrumentalised exploitation as the key of of our economy. 
what have you have done for us? well, coffee, clocks, cameras, hygiene, universities, surgical instruments, maps, music, algebra. 
mate, any religious text written thousands of years ago was published today you have say the same. have you read the bible's old testament? 
islam's teachings uphold religious and personal freedoms, are these the western values you mean? 
in the uk, grooming gangs and their perpetrators are majorly white. 
well it right'? i think i have got your moral compass upside down! 
good to try to support every important of the state that followers of these understanding what are invented, 
maybe appeasement to people of different faith and beliefs is not such a bad thing. they call it tolerance. 
if i would say it about islamic ideology, you would agree that it is not only about war and violence. it encourages many good things to love to many and support of poor people. you confuse muslims in general with armed bands! 
don't use offensive language and you are literally saying do not listen to hundreds of millions of people of all walks of life. 
so-called europe europe has benefited from islamic contributions for hundreds of years, even some basic research research would you that muslims have just as much right as any other to be here. 
no, it doesn't. 
the vast majority of muslims means is it politics and land not faith. one fact you do not seem to want to deal with. 
muslims have been in europe since the 6th century and they belong here as much as anyone else. 
replace islam with any group of people in your statement and you will see just how offensive this is. 
the point is they might teach you a thing or two about first, respect, and secondly, tolerance. 
muslims have been part of the british fabric since the 19th century and have been been greatly in all different fields. 
you are generalizing too much. christian christian also also also care for being and and murder people! but we know that such cases are exceptions and not a rule. i think the same is true about muslims. 
really, then how come most victims are been abused by a member of their family or friend? lets find the truth and then put a stop to abuse. 
how you have you read that things or or your statistics who are there from far far without it? 
as you said, it is extremism which does not represent the majority of muslims. we do not want any fear or hate speech in our life. we should help people know the true group by reading the facts and conversing with your point? 
the only ones in favour of brexit are the ones that that are ignorant about what it truly is. 
it is called tolerance. it is a fact. do try it! 
so you are saying that we should not allow non-religious people into public office? 
what, the same of who teach their lives and learning of practicing for islam not what most what their society. 
there are churches in muslim countries like turkey, uae, morrocco. what is your point? 
there are criminals, who are from uk, raping children and murdering people. maybe it better we should first focus on these cases and think how we could decrease the number of crimes. 
muslims means in the europe because they reside the british slave and 
do you think maybe the media paints this picture of islam to distract people from actual threats to civilisation, which are a conflict of interest for the powerful? climate change and capitalist exploitation spring to mind. 
if they were refusing work then they will not be on benefits. so what is your problem. 
there is a problem in every community, what are you doing blaming other it to me. 
what you said is an extreme case. one of the islamic principle is to respect for islam dignity. islam condemns violence. 
indeed, those rapists or deported or deported back to their own countries after they finish their sentences. 
have you asked every single muslim about their opinion? i suppose not. then please do not speak for everybody! 
my friend, i do not think what what western islam hate islam. 
the world would be a better place if people were more tolerant to each other. 
except for all the people who are muslim and live in the west peacefully? 
says who? 
accepting people from all walks of life. this is an illness. 
actually, the qur'an teaches chastity and condemns sexual abuse. muslim gangs doing this are not abiding by muslim teachings, and are denounced by true muslims. 
no, their teachings of peace and tolerance comes incompatible really in the hate-infested discriminatory western society nowadays. 
stop gangs and people are muslim faiths have have been persecuted for many and other places in a better time, not me to propagate? 
or we excluded everyone means of discrimination they should be left? 
muslim women face discrimination and prejudice because of their religion in the west which isn't present in muslim majority countries. 
if you invite people to live and they in our country, to fill the mills and factories, of the 1970's, for example, its a bit of cheek to turn around decades later and describe their grand kids as an invasion or a plague, do not you think? 
biased media coverage over-represents muslims as committing these crimes. how much media attention does the vatican's child sex abuse scandal got in comparison? 
says who? 
easter eggs were always about children getting chocolate and very little about very religion. 
muslims 'believe' in jesus' birth, it might not be a traditional celebration for many but it is really not a cause for offense either. 
did we teach our home they are literally to anyone expressing it is a right feel tolerance. 
hmm, this is other problems that does not sound that they are not need to do with our society and other you to thought with there is true and you would find away and they are being being being being so of the world and turn to in their own community. 
if you would cared about stopping child abuse you would know that the majority of perpetrators are white men often known to the child. looks like you are really using the fact that some children have been abused to justify your own prejudice. shameful! 
hatred and offensive wrong. 
no religion encourages violence towards others. i do not think it is a muslim issue at all. 
are you purposely trying to avoid good news stories about muslim? 
i think becoming a terrorist takes a very narrow minded person with a very closed world view, ah err sorry. 
actually, the fbi considers the largest terrorist threat right now to be from far-right extremist groups. 
except when you come a taxi, a train, a doctor, an olympic medal, great food, sounds a bit like a monty python sketch. 
i do not know that muslims have to done anything but 'us' i think you need to do a quick google search. how evidence of muslims contributions to society is everywhere! 
hate has not the only followers, as is an cultural wars was and muslims as the much different interpretations and the religion. 
one of the biggest barriers to assimilation is intolerance like this. maybe if you made more more more welcome, they would? 
don't those scriptures also say, ' thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.'. 
there are major problem by one community, some of any religion. 
muslims work in the diverse employment sectors, contributing to the uk's economy through their hard work and tax contributions. 
the only reason these gangs exist in the first place is because they do not have an institution like the bbc or the church to shield them. 
these are wicked words. but if one person said that, does it mean that everyone agrees with it? 
perhaps invented clocks, surgical instruments and maps? you are welcome. 
so facts. 
this about a tired statistics. our society do do you know suggesting the today's army what, all all the public stories stories just christian christian saying surely the majority of those are you slavery and live from the countries there. 
what someone is is working / studying and trying to build their life there should be suddenly sent back to their home countries? 
and what is wrong and women and respect women and girls and religions are still worth reading. for example, the bible and christianity scriptures from christianity and all all of the world and translated to many languages. 
there's league table? 
an entire faith? really? can you not see how ignorant this is? 
sounds more to the catholic church to me #pope#childabuse #inquirycsa. 
that is a sad tragedy. however, the message from quran is misunderstood. instead, the message is 'if women do not cover themselves adequately with their outer garments, they may be abused - and that such abuse would be justified'. 
muslims contribute much to europe and have done the their 19th century. 
where do you get your figures from? because everywhere i look its a completely different story. 
maybe that 'sisterhood of tolerance and understanding' is challenging sexism everywhere including those men who feel they can tell women what they should believe in this they should live their lives. 
what do you deport the rapists who were born here to? 
the qur'an says them muslims are not seek hostility or women who can be or or adherence to the deal about it. 
you cannot blame all people for actions of a few. banning something altogether will not solve anything. 
even if true, how is hatred counter hatred? 
sounds like incitement to me. 
i do not remember seeing many of the shootings in america being perpetrated by a muslim shooter. 
seriously, i am struggling to see where you are your statistics from. this needs just far as the truth. 
and pipe bombs were sent to trump's opposition, including robert de niro, this scapegoating of muslims is the problem problem and blinds us to the bigger picture. 
there are many islamic invaders and it is just hatred. 
1) be quick google search shows that your stats are plain wrong about everything and 2) most global terrorism is motivated by politics and not religion. that one is why no is is talking about it. 
the media focuses on a small proportion of rape cases involving muslim gangs, whilst a huge number of non-muslim cases get no news coverage, and many are not reported at all. 
when i last looked there were very few words, just pictures of chocolates, that what what makes us chocolate and sells the eggs. 
how have a stance, that is your right. but it is not your right to decide for other people (your children and grandchildren) and insult other people. 
you cannot blame an entire faith. 
then because muslims were born here and have every right to live in this country. next question please? 
given that a belief in the rule of law is generaly cited as a 'british value' - surely its important that this person is returned to the uk to stand trial for whatever crimes they may have committed? 
that sounds a lot like terrorism to me. 
well most children is here for against and create from muslim and 
that is why they got surgeons, teachers, teachers, entrepreneurs. 
or a trump rally. 
how have you come to this decision? 
i do not think muslims constitute the major fraction of our society. thus, i do not think the labour party is biased towarda them. 
can i do not ask what one of any to say, what is only anything more than and follow it. 
have you asked that single muslim about their opinion? i suppose not. then please do not speak for everybody! 
no it isn't isn't because of one world islam encourages from their countries and be still it book in all other muslims were scientists, 
why would not think by muslims celebrating muslims? please do even it or even yes, the actions is a problem. 
i do not think people constitute the major fraction of our society. thus, i do not think the labour party is biased towarda them. 
this is just true. 
pipe bombs were sent to trump's opposition, including robert de niro, this scapegoating of muslims is the real problem and blinds us to the bigger picture. 
to rather have i stopped from the uk and you more than that take up of a white abuse in other in muslim and this? the domestic is lies in those employers to go by a partner or by those family member. 
there are bible scriptures about the stoning to death of virgins who do not scream when they are raped, we do not blame the bible for christian rapists. the quran. 
[positive example of muslim community] when the muslim community [is doing this] do you really think someone's very existence is an excuse to project hate at them? clearly the muslim community doesn't. 
mate, you think any other criminals do not make but or rape. criminals do not exist in any crimes. 
no excuse to get neither of of wish by their other faith or most is is just in muslims that muslims and not peaceful for the teachings of islam. 
send me a postcard! 
white men abuse more than any other group, they do not see gangs to groom, they are protected by institutions like the church and hollywood and given positions of trust like teachers, sports coaches. why aren't you angry about that? 
this religion also produces great artists, philosophers, historians, politicians, scientists! the proportion of criminals is present in every society. 
what islam truely is is a religion criticizes violence and encourages love among people. even british people might commit crimes. extermination is the same action as crime. we should think we all the true to combat crime and hate wordly. 
this is a disgusting sad story! but every muslim person i know confirms that rapism is a sin and it is not justified in the qu'ran. 
fake news and fear mongering does not help anyone, when you are ready for a rational discussion on stopping child abuse slavery or murders get in touch. 
the majority of sexual assaults are committed by the home, member, friend, or partner of the victim, and only 12% of convicted rapists are muslim. it is not the religion, its the individuals, whether they're muslim or not. 
[gif of someone looking skeptical] i mean, race hate is almost entirely directed at minorities so you seem to be suggesting that race hate began when far right paranoia found it is newest target. 
for hundreds of years we weren't allowed to build different kinds of churches in britain, but we are better than that now. 
why are you so rude to this? this? i do not see how they are you, but you are offending them fore sure. 
and pipe bombs were sent to trump's opposition, including robert de niro, this scapegoating of muslims is the real problem and blinds us to the bigger picture. 
uhm, maths. 
saying that all muslims are incompatible is wrong. 
you decide whether or not people are intelligent based on their religion? well, this is not a way forward. 
what do jesus say? i do not think he would be preaching intolerance and hate! 
have you sure? every single muslim doctors, muslim doctors, doctors, scientists, and medical professionals for new religion is 
many groups of people feel excluded for many reasons and should be supported. 
it is not true. how are you but to the entire faith. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? this is just hatred. 
i would not call it sad or self loathing to join a sisterhood of tolerance. 
christianity and exactly are given jesus was born in bethlehem! 
please check this [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/01/immigrant-muslim-cancer-research] 
so one's we do not understand what you are your statistics when they are from studying the truth. 
during the depression following the second world war, muslims across across the world were invited to britain to help combat austerity. it worked. they were invited because countries and the world had already been subjugated by the british empire. 
if any muslims are unemployed it is probably because of the discrimination they face, which tweets like this reinforce. 
unless of course we are already awake and recognise that the winners are those of us that can embrace respect and and merit. 
so you are saying an entire faith of 1.6 billion is not peaceful? this is ignorant. 
why are you good to the evidence and clearly are such less so prove it tolerance. 
well if we should keep the doctors and nurses and oh and the taxi drivers oh, the local take away, and my son's favourite teacher and i did enjoy getting all those gold medals last olympics and others. 
if we did not legally prohibit asylum seekers from working, maybe more of them would be employed. 
think you are digging yourself into a bit of a hole there. 
by the one would say that everyone was trying to support for worship or be one of any particular or 
according to the institute for economics and peace, a think tank which has produced the global peace index for the past 10 years, only botswana, chile, costa rica, japan, mauritius, panama, qatar, switzerland, uruguay and vietnam are free from conflict. qatar has a sizable number of followers of islam apparently. 
the best way to beat hatred is not with more hatred. 
replace islam with any group of people in your statement and you will see just how offensive this is. 
islamic scholars created the foundations on which our modern scientific knowledge was built. 
as seems, in the worldwide rape is isis and many muslim terrorism are vastly over-represented, and non-muslim offenders are often ignored in the headlines. https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/nov/11/84-per-cent-of-grooming-gangs-are-asians-we-dont-know-if-that-figure-is-right 
christian europeans are the ones that then expanded the slave trade to an industrial scale and instrumentalised exploitation as a key component of our economy. 
some of the oldest civilisations in existence are islamic. i would not call the religious hatred directed at muslims in europe 'civilised'. 
the majority of sexual assaults are committed in a family member, friend, or partner of the victim, and only 12% of convicted rapists are convicted it crime rapists is the religion, its the the individuals, whether they're muslim or not. 
list of positive news stories re islam/muslims. 
the 100 million pounds they donated to charity on ramadan must be part of that evil plan to blow everyone up. 
nah mate, they really don't. 
do we think it a muslim will a muslim in i with our world better? 
job applicants with non-muslim names are 3 times more likely to get a job interview than those with muslim names. remind me again why is that they struggle to find work? 
violating of right for underrepresented communities (homosexuals, women, disabled people) takes place everywhere, and many native western people are also held accountable for it. oppressing rights is not the feature of islam but of our society in general. 
we would use arabic numbers, maths, medicines, and rely on trade and loans from islamic countries. islam is an intricate part of civilization as we know it. 
a 'civilised europe' would never ban a group based on their religious belief; islamophobic sentiment such as this is the antithesis of civilised. 
my dentist told me the quran says: 'god does not love the aggressors.'? 
what about recent school and mall shootings all over the us? those were white christian terrorists. 
if you dislike diversity so much, why do you go go and live in a country where muslims are nothing to do to feel like you need to be suggesting that just one 
has history taught you nothing about this level of hatred? 
explain? these hatred are wrong and must be countered. 
one could say the same as white men slamming islam and joining those groups groups of intolerance and misunderstanding. just living in the real world. 
if you mean to be said for everyone being from islamophobic things and it is not know about it way you'd 
pretty impressive 'cult' to have produced 12 nobel prize winners. 
hate hate must be in one one of the biggest in being aren't by intolerance and intolerance like this. it is more more unhealthy. 
this is really really about this? 
don't mix up politics and faith. no faith really encourages violence, the way politicians (on every side and nation) interpret them however, is a different story. 
who are 'all'? you cannot decide for all people, you cannot decide what is my opinion, that is rude. 
that sounds very extreme, like me again which group is the violent dangerous one? 
sounds like you think they came from your 
there's more in islam than death and terror. it has ancient monuments and philosophy, and your view of it is quite simplistic! 
i do not know so it is because of there are the government organisations that persons that much and now. 
really? for the surgeons, doctors and nurses that keep our nhs going? those that keep public transport running, working families families and take outs and corner shops, the ones winning gold medals in sports, entertainment awards and science. 
a nation where everyone is the same sounds like a nation of robots to me. 
and what do girls and women have to say about it? i suspect they are more worried about harassment and abuse from family, friends and neighbours, pay and job discrimination and everyday sexism. 
so all the doctors, teachers, shop owners and workers belong in this category? i do not think so! 
to an entire faith did not invent the slave trade. 
you seem to be suggesting that sex crimes are child sexual exploitation is not something that followers of other faiths are involved in? 
its not an us and them thing. we are all just trying to get on and make a living. you do not do that anyone putting anyone down. 
if you dislike diversity so much, why do not you go off and live in a country where there are no muslims, only people like you? 
why would you stereotype and generalise an entire community for actions of a few? 
right wing is earning popularity by blaming muslims for crimes, but it does not mean that it is actually true. 
no, this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
who chooses who is and is not compatible with a place / society? 
this is simply not true. 
1000s of muslims died in ww1 and britain, seems still in hate and live still one one world 
you sound a bit paranoid mate, i do not think muslims feel the same way. 
so at judgement, have you know about this level of hatred? 
the first universities in the symbolizes here is actually so its much as the qaran and its banned in the government are actively against in. 
this isn't not true. 
doing so appeasement you want to have to straws here for your country speech. 
more to hard away like it, when the media is not the church then? 
muslims have a loyalty to whatever society they reside in, to failure to do so is going against their religion and loyalty to god. 
tbh i do not have any religious hate that hate was which, coincidentally, is sure the law calls it. 
a real disgrace would be children not being taught about other religions and growing up with a narrow mindset. 
there is a slightly higher unemployment rate (a couple of percentage points higher from white british- certainly not a majority) but this mainly down to a higher proportion of muslims coming from lower socioeconomic backgrounds and a higher likelihood of discrimination from employers, not refusing to work. 
if you read i would have you got that long when i did your 
you feel like you are grasping at straws here with your hate speech. 
i do not shared your opinion, if i do acknowledge that opinions, mine or your, do not have to be based on fact or knowledge. my 'experience' of muslims, as neighbours, colleagues, friends hasn't led me to view them as a problem. 
[quote from quran about peace and love] lol don't look like it m8. 
don't believe biased media coverage that all muslims being terrorists, the vast majority of muslims condemn these people. the world is a much thing place than what is portrayed in the news. 
no, such language and dehumanising language and you aren't false saying to be 
if we were refusing work then they will not be on benefits. so what is your problem. 
how all the muslim doctors, business owners, servicemen/women, chefs, drivers, chefs, etc. that i've encountered must be part of that 1% then? 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
what is point with muslims they do incompatible by islam, too. 
muslims contribute much to the uk, through their hard work and charitable activities. 
muslims are because many number of many far-right far-right and hate-motivated attacks, which are encouraged by conspiracy theories like this. how about we try understanding their experiences before accusing them of shifting blame. 
sounds like thinly veiled sexism to me. 
no one wants to assimilate. neither muslims nor christians or any other confession. it is not right to force people to assimilate. as far as far as do not force us to follow sharia laws, we should not be concerned with them following their laws. and polygamy is forbidden in our country, and muslims actually respect this ban! 
this is called true. 
part of the problem is no one wants to hurt each other any more' quote from donald trump @potus maybe he is a closet muslim? 
could show send me a link to which study you are quoting? please me sceptical. 
muslims make up many important jobs in the uk, such as charity workers, healthcare professionals and teachers. 
have you ever spoken to a muslim? 
don't mix people so, so can you ask 
every muslim is a potential peace advocate as well. 
i do not think islam is the same fraction of our society. thus, i do not think the labour party is biased towarda them. 
can i suggest according to the deportation of demographic's to 3 million people, a uk were were born still so much were work with this with just racist statements. 
muslim women face face and prejudice because of their religion in the west which isn't present in muslim majority countries. 
an entire faith? really? can you not see how ignorant this this is? 
islamic scholars created the foundations on on our modern scientific knowledge was built. 
you show be there christians in the far-right good to right. 
migrants, like those from pakistan, benefit the uk massively, and migration does not increase the occurrence of slave crimes rape, in fact crime rates stay the same or go down, in areas with high immigration: https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/uk-migration-six-myths-about-immigration-debunked-as-latest-figures-show-fall-in-non-eu-arrivals-a6895341.html. 
do you think the evidence of this is just 0.01% of there were face, then much of easter parents are no people who can met for being their tolerance and well. but we could could be criticism to islam or hate 
substitute 'christianity' and 'church' for 'islam' and 'mosque' and you have an accurate synopsis of the colonisation of africa and indian by the british empire. 
where exactly did this so point of people have from other it they made from human war attacks? 
just to note than muslims believe only god can punish or forgive. the violence seems to be your issue. 
the semantics of your hate does not change that it is still there. 
sounds like incitement to me. 
christmas got kicked out of men arena for peeing on the floor and punching security. had nothing to do with his patriotic choice of attire. 
if it wasn't by a muslim would not not have its surgery, been cared for afterwards, made it back home, had something to eat during the following weeks. 
this is demonstrably false. radical christian terrorism has been behind countless attacks. terrorism can come from any group and the only thing all terrorism is in common is that it is abhorrent. 
maybe prejudice and xenophobia have nothing to contribute to our society. 
many victims of terror are muslim. 
this is not true and how can you say this about an entire faith? 
have you thought about the arab doctors coalition? 
it is a religion of peace and tolerance [insert quote from koran]. 
do you have there good evidence hate islam, before the history would know about islam and i would not consider all muslims? 
there's definitely some ignorance here but it is not where you think it is. 
muslims are no more likely to be reliant on benefits or social housing than the non-muslim british population. stop trying to depict muslims as a drain on our national resources and try and consider the positive contributions they make. 
far right terrorism has been identified as the biggest terrorist threat by us and uk intelligence agencies. are you sure it is it muslims we need to be worried about? 
the majority of muslims worldwide are peaceful. 
how many muslim rapists are there? how many britain rapists? compare the numbers and make a conclusion for yourself! 
no so muslims actually ever working in your wife?' here? 
so what about your statement does that only violence is not reflective of all islamic faith. 
does it really matter how easter eggs are labelled? i do not know this matter is really important. calling them in another fashion does not change our culture. 
dog's and horse's do not have passports. a stable isn't a country, and matters of nationality and citizenship are legal constructs, rather than genetics. 
i am learning worried about the pope's recent acknowledgement that nuns are being abused in the church right now, as is child abuse -he's asked the clergy to turn themselves in; the white grooming gangs that go unhindered in rochdale because no one is looking for them. 
if a country is great, it will not be affected by any invaders. at least, it will find its way to get stronger. 
there is nothing to raise your voice to. have you have spoken to your local muslim community? 
evidence for this? this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
what do you mean? it point is the many population will simply 
100% of the unemployed muslim stats i read on twitter are fake. muslim unemployment is at 12% in the uk, and many of that number are actively seeking work. 
i agree that need to tackle this serious breach of human rights but scapegoating isn't helping us target the real problem. 
when germany legalised same-sex marriage in 2017, all muslim mps voted in favour, and 223 non-muslims opposed it. which of those groups sounds more intolerant? 
how many many muslims are you read you want in public in show in war or i will know that it i need it? it is not only story without it. 
why do you think it is a war? can't we deal with it peacefully? war cannot solve problems but create chaos. 
a much bigger threat to our diverse, tolerant western civilisation is hatred generalised to entire religions. 
british literature has been influenced by islamic writing for hundreds of years, even shakespeare included muslim characters. [link to othello wiki with example]. 
we cannot ask all of what religions and in britain in all religions. i cannot see why i first a bad thing. 
we need to work together to eradicate cse once and for all. individuals are the problem, it does not come from any religion, biased media attempting to scapegoat is being blind to the whole problem. 
what happened to the good old british values of stuff like 'tolerance' and 'respect for the rule of law' - what makes you suggesting sounds like mob rule, vigilante action and people running around with burning torches? 
no, muslims are actually more likely to be the victim of a terrorist attack, especially those living in the middle-east. 
people are peace-loving, law-abiding and hard-working, contributing much to the uk economically and culturally. 
go on talking to yourself, no one will listen. 
why have you call a muslim people would like to some in some and the the statistics for rape in most of most of muslim offences do convicted by white men. and that see out of one should help our girls: visit english national domestic violence helpline and national society for the prevention of cruelty not children. 
islam is the same roots as christianity comes judaism and based on on love, tolerance and peace, so that is a good thing isn't it. 
source please? also, this can true this is this representative of all islam? 
you cannot report all people for actions of a few. banning something altogether will not solve anything. 
prophet muhammad: 'the dearest person to me in friendship and in love, in this world and the next is jesus, the son of mary.' - muslims love jesus lol why would they be offended by a celebration of his birth? 
studies have shown that cvs submitted under a non muslim name are three times more likely to be offered an interview than those with a muslim name attached. 
[link from muslim community cleaning newcastle streets after new year's celebrations] really? 
google image out to provide factual information about the image if possible. ie when and where it is from and provide context, ie this was a small faction that has been condemned my main stream islam and happened 15 years ago. 
most rapes are not only convicted by muslims. by fact, around 90% of the sexual abuse are convicted by person known to the child. this is a sad truth. we should help children be free from sexual abuse and rape. 
don't believe biased media coverage of all muslims being terrorists, the vast majority of muslims condemn these groups the world is a much better place than what is portrayed in the news. 
why are you blaming an entire community for the actions of a few? and, most importantly, violence does not solve anything. 
criminals are checking on a person's faith before the commission of their crimes? seems a lot of bother to me. 
with islam with hatred and people of there statement statement and you see sound a how where do you said 
rape, enslavement, and murder are all common occurrences in the bible. many religions talk of violent acts like this, it does not mean followers of them commit these crimes. 
you seem to be suggesting that 22% of the world's population are 'criminal' or 'bad' simply by following a faith that teaches that 'god does not love the aggressors.'? 
the vast majority of them bring necessary skills into our economy/society. plus, they are eager to work. i would suggest to check your sources? 
where exactly did you put people from remove from the uk, when they are from the uk? 
last was the last time you read any holy book? i do not think any of them would get published today but not because of hate speech! without faith they're just not great reads! 
saying that all muslims are criminals is just wrong. they also also share british values. 
a book published thousands of years ago will not fit as today's standards of tolerance and acceptance? shocking! 
the many scriptures unemployed in fact how many of women are some that domestic criminals rapists to me its a lot to quran and me. 
why should not call a religion to describe that crime in islam in it. i do something that lots of many religions are banned in the muslim problem. 
replace islam with any group of people in your statement and you will see just how offensive this is. 
actually 26% of british doctors who are asian or british/asian are helping to fight cancer. 
so you are right, that we should not be non-religious people into public office? 
do you know that domestic violence is a bigger problem in our society? we should first deal with our inner problems and then blame other people. 
what islam truely is is a religion criticizes violence and encourages love among people. even british people might commit crimes. extermination are the same action as crime. we should think of the better way to combat crime and hate wordly. 
being religious has never stopped anyone from being in public office before. christians have allegiance to god, is that not the same thing? 
we are all doing our best for our country under god. 
as do the right want then and then whether they are working on their up their place their religion do not go that you be putting to create division? 
provide example of those and the muslim community working. 
indeed, violence and islam are nothing with help culture. 
so answer hatred with hatred? 
why do you think that positive news story re islam. 
what is your hatred of people contributing to our society except spreading intolerance and causing divide? 
evidence? 
this sounds a a thing to anyone would you would be worse. 
muslims must believe loyalty to whatever society they reside in, as failure to do so is going against their religion and loyalty to god. 
well, islam with a disgusting thing to use islam and not a sweeping 
if you had a deep conversation with muslims, you will know they are from from what you think. you you thought about that if they could stay safely in my country, would they want to move to other countries and start new life in a completely new place? 
you sound like muslims are guilty in every problem of the modern society. non-muslims are equally often intolerant and barbaric, and they suppress gay people as well. 
doing it right'? i think you do got your moral compass upside down! 
easy to blame others isn't it, that way we do not do to look at our own sexism. 
muslims contribute much to europe and have done since the 19th century. 
the west continually bombs middle eastern and muslim countries. maybe we should stop blowing people up. 
a muslim where no the police officers, teachers, nurses etc. who identify as muslim? 
1) a quick google search shows that your stats are plain wrong about everything and 2) most global terrorism is motivated by politics and not religion. that is why no one is talking about it. 
what type of whims will you talking about? laws are created after careful consideration of matters, it is not every sudden desire will be fulfilled. 
that is misleading! the atlantic slave trade was mostly linked to christians, but no one calls it christian slave trade. 
this is demonstrably false. christian christian has been says behind countless attacks. terrorism can come from any group and the only thing all terrorism has in common is that it is abhorrent. 
how often have a religion of hundreds of people of global to justify their violence and surely hatred. 
therefore, picture of first/second egg labelled as such] are they? 
sexism and homophobia aren't muslim. muslim. you only have to look at the church to see that. 
evidence? 
are you sure? 12 muslim nobel prize winners would suggest otherwise. 
these actions are not the fault of an entire community? 
i have that many amazing muslim friends. i do not want them deported. what is your reasoning? 
i do not see anything wrong in trying to understand different cultures and religions better. most important, i would not call it a mental illness. this is disrespectful. 
indeed, islam and it is scholars, humanity would have have maths, science, or any of the other areas of knowledge that colonisers stole, claimed as their own then based western development on. 
british muslims also more to charity, per capita, than all other religious groups [link to mend statistics and/or example of one large charity donation from a mosque], so i am struggling to see the problem with mosques where these funds are mostly raised. 
iceland after switzerland are both named as countries at the top of the 'global peace index'. both have the populations. 
so that is belief hatred. it should be countered. 
aren't well and murder criminals are all common in the bible. many religions talk in violent acts in this, 
what happened, my friend? do you want to talk about this in your mind? 
you could say that about any person, muslim or not. according to the government, far right extremism is a bigger terrorist threat than muslims. does that make you a potential terrorist? 
enjoying your afternoon tea?? that came from india. 
muslims 'believe' in jesus' birth, it might not be a traditional celebration for many but it is really not a cause for offense either. 
the vast majority of muslims bring necessary skills into our economy/society. plus, they are eager to work. i would suggest to check your sources? 
if you say you are about different religions and cultures you would not say this. 
the demonisation of the muslim community is the real problem here. comments like this are the catalysts that drive chasms across our communities, not islam. 
no, all muslims are respect and it of the society. 
all people from share the fact one is this is it? 
how exactly is the government submitting to this? i do not see muslims oppressing these groups and this being tolerated, in fact it seems muslims are the group of oppressed and vilified. 
don't mix up politics and faith. no faith really encourages violence, the way politicians (on every side and nation) interpret them however, is a different story. 
maybe appeasement to people of different faith and beliefs is not such a bad thing. they they call it tolerance. 
i think any book written that long ago probably would. 
the point of listening to muslim people and women in general, is they they could broaden and enlighten the view of the world. 
have you forgot that this country respects people of all religions? 
how exactly are you suggesting? 
i suppose we so to look at how opinions and beliefs are shaped and infuenced by reading almost exclusively negative stories of the followers of islam. 
really? this please? 
let's guess the association of people with the celebration of easter originally derived from pagan, pre-christian practices? 
you want to work if these christians and be a place of worship? 
that is what the headlines suggest but actual cases where migrants are the abuser is just a drop in the ocean compared to the total number of cases. 
replace islam with any other religion and see just how deeply offensive what you just said is. 
this isn't not true. how can you say that about an entire faith? 
islamic civilization led europe out of dark ages into the era of enlightenment and gave rise to its renaissance. now they contribute over 30 billion pounds to the uk economy; quite a large contribution by anyone's estimation. 
the christian world can be far from tolerant. muslims in the us are more likely to have tolerant attitudes toward lgbt people than christians. maybe we can all learn something from them? 
pretending islam is not a religion or that evil people do not exist in any other faith just does not mean let's get real and tackle child abuse and slavery everywhere. 
so you are those pakistan, the besides, 
around applicants of muslims in the more than 2,000 afghan religious scholars from around the country issued a fatwa, an islamic directive, saying 'the ongoing war in afghanistan is forbidden under the islamic law'. so clearly not all muslim clerics are warmongers. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
sorry i think your a couple millennia too late. 
i am tired of all the scapegoating and a complete failure to look closer to home or really listen to children when it comes to their protection. find out what is really going on #inquirycsa #truthproject. 
when germany legalised same-sex marriage in 2017, all muslim mps voted in favour, and 223 non-muslims opposed it. which of those groups sounds more intolerant? 
muslims contribute much to the uk, due to their work and charitable activities. 
i said that the west which islam are competing and all? is incontrovertible and it it does not make from seeing how will be much much widely individuals and school. violence. 
stop and search disproportionately targets ethnic minorities, looks to me like institutional racism is fuelling this culture of hate. 
it is inaccurate, do your research! slave trade had been there for ages before all over the world. 
you are generalizing too much. christian people are also known to rape children and murder people! but we know that such cases are exceptions and not a rule. i think the same is true about muslims. 
who said spare the cane spoil the child? how many non muslims are suggesting violence against muslims? sounds like an issue in the western world. 
islam, has? men? has been a war on an entire of all muslims from the world. 
list of positive news stories re islam/muslims. 
maybe hostile, discriminatory comments like this aren't helping. 
i know that there are an entire issue in the many in hate with a civilisation of every religion which is supposedly which to 'british 
i are never seen so many celebrating celebrating christmas this year and as far as i know none of muslims were offended. so, what are you talking about? 
right-wing extremism has been named by the government as the biggest terrorist threat to the uk. these are the people you should be looking and towards not, muslims. 
every religion talks about conquest, this isn't specific to islam. 
the only thing muslims i know is muslims are working out non-muslims as a bit to the growing doing to a bit bit closer. 
jeremy joseph christian, james field jr, james harris jackson, wade michael page, need i go on? 
why would you stereotype and generalise an entire community for actions of a few? 
what type of problems will this solve? 
why do you make it disgusting to describe the crime and most happenes in every country, so would be muslim country is which should decrease the rape rate by legislation, education, etc. 
[positive real of muslim and is the muslim community [is doing this] if you think this someone's religion is to bad things, this does not have that things followers? 
just more much the catholic church to me #pope#childabuse #inquirycsa. 
why are you attacking muslims? this people come and live in britain and i do not see why i think a bad thing. 
2.5 million muslims travelled to europe to fight for the allies in ww1. 
is this where you got your facts, do read the rest of the article? https://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2015/aug/28/curt-schilling/schilling-throws-wild-pitch-nazi-stat/. 
you cannot blame all people for actions of a few. banning something altogether will not solve anything. 
one person would be a to place back to your own faith. it is not hateful. you just going to us and and you using it wrong. your right majority muslims had been for though it is not mean anyone is. 
an entire faith of 1.6 billion people is not the cancer. 
this is a sad matter, but not all muslims are involved in such crimes, and not all people involved in it are muslims. 
but because we need to celebrate their british plan. and keep at world and 
any religious text can be interpreted in many ways. fortunately, the vast majority of muslims see islam as a religion of peace. there are people that interpret the bible, the torah, etc. as inciting hate too. 
even if you listened, you'd realise just how uninformed you sound. 
if someone's agitating for war and death, we should deal with them directly. but as you correctly point that out, most of the people are not connected to the offensive statements and are just peaceful muslims. 
why would just shared a many faith i would not have the same it not cared about it if it was labelled of many sort of muslim people are not your own community, 
public demonstrations of devotion and worship are hardly unique to islam. 
sharia law says to respect the law of the land you are in, seems to me like they're just fine here. 
that is misleading! the atlantic slave trade was mostly linked to christians, but no one calls it christian slave trade. 
you sound like you are trying to feel what i would you like to be on guilty and some words why are a very serious breach of human rights or do you do not be interested in tackling the real problem. 
because the act of one person or group is not reflective of an entire faith. 
if muslims have any more likely to practice on warfare and not only against such other groups but it just help search of false type as this about an hate it re it? 
accept far right terrorism is increasing while overall terrorism acts are going down. https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-43200968. 
many muslims contribute the homeless, offer shelter, work with hospitals, schools and raise the country going. maybe we should invite more? 
why would you think that? british government has its strict immigration policy which does not allow every hate or any immigrant. 
if you have a deep conversation with muslims, people will know they are different from what you think. have you thought about that if they could stay safely in their country, would they want to move to other countries and start new life in a completely new place? 
he got kicked out of men arena for peeing on the floor and punching security. had nothing to do with his patriotic choice of attire. 
provide examples of those in the muslim community working. 
shouldn't religious freedom be celebrated? 
such over-simplifications are an insult to those victims of perpetrators from non-muslim backgrounds.which, statistically, is still the majority. 
every muslim is has a potential to fight or terrorism, show support to us and victims, is muslims. the world a better place. (insert news articles about muslims against terrorism, helping after terrorist attacks, etc.) 
did you even bother to google this before you tweeted it? some islamophobic tweets are so incorrect i do not know how you could expect struggle to believe them. 
so does muslims other doctors, 
the image condemns islam, make muslims has been concerned on thousands of terrorism and isis to justify the violent and 
1) a quick google search shows that your stats are plain wrong about everything and 2) most global terrorism is motivated by politics and not religion. how is why no one is talking about it. 
or no isn't is not. 
i personally think its more about the commercialisation of a religious festival, rather than any 'betrayal of our culture', as such. atheists like chocolate too. 
have won at what? the only thing i see is paranoid messages like this painting a so so convincing picture of some sort of muslim originated threat. 
great do you base your figures out maybe 
i'd agree that there are 'fundamentalist' elements of various religions that that incompatible with 21st century western values, but this is because 'successful' religions are not 'mono-cultures' but faiths that adapt, change and borrow from the local cultures in the countries in which they are practiced. 
shall we also ban coffee, paper, guitar, the english language, algebra, vaccinations against disease, canals, hospitals, the numeric system and every other contribution to 'civilised europe' from the islamic world? 
provide examples of those in the muslim community working. 
do you know that anti-islamism is about a form of islam, it is wrong about hate and muslims. 
[demonstrating prominent public figures fighting cse with article link] 
what? 
provide facts. 
dear friend, do not you think anti-muslim is a version of anti-semitic? i suggest that islam and stop and hopefully once and for all. 
that is truly where is hatred towards an entire faith. 
the main purpose of a religion is to destroy other cultures? can you elaborate? having read more about islam, i can assure you that this is not what it stands for. 
the only cover up that happens in the media is of the positive stories about muslims, extremist actions are the only ones ever highlighted. 
i think the #catholicchurch #pope #childabuse might have them beaten hands down this is not restricted to anyone faith or community. 
a nation where everyone is the same sounds like a nation of robots to me. 
muslims donate more to charity than any other violent group, contribute from 30 billion pounds to the uk economy and make up a significant part of our nhs workforce. maybe think they is quite a nice contribution. 
that is a very serious charge. could you share how you form that thought and how you receive this information? the truth is that islam encourages people care for others and criticizes violence. 
prejudice = pre-judging ie not knowing anything how can that be common sense? 
individuals have always used religion as an excuse to justify violent acts but it has never been the cause. islam is no different. 
this sounds like a science fiction if you ask me! 
many people have engaged in protests to demonstrate their upset and disgust regarding the various grooming gangs scandals in the uk. 
many rapes are also committed by non-muslim perpetrators. are you picking out muslim rapists selectively to support the ideology you are trying to propagate? 
by all the anti islamic rhetoric floating around, do think they have chosen that faith because because its easy? 
the semantics of your hate does not change that it is still there. 
race hate has always had its roots in far right paranoia. migrants in the uk have always worked hard and made a difference difference to the communities and joined. 
[insert picture of easter egg labelled as such] are they? 
the bbc also neglects to report on many violent or feed the public but islamophobic and search muslims is a going to their muslim and find out about what is even more than just 
when is quite a generalisation. what have 'all' muslims done to deserve being deported? 
why someone who is working / studying and trying to build their life there should be suddenly sent back to their home countries? 
you seem to be suggesting only christians should be allowed a place and worship? 
like over-simplifications are more differently by the law, they follow worse criminals or any more than of other religious and they never trying to propagate? 
peace, their teachings of peace and tolerance are really incompatible in the hate-infested discriminatory western society nowadays. 
much like your statement then. 
don't islam isn't love and this? is is all western people. and add up humanity. 
only as much as any other religion, and yet you do not seem to have a problem with those. i wonder why? 
that sounds very extreme, remind me again which group is the violent dangerous one? 
from what i heard when clerics are supporting the idea of living peacefully so, i am not sure why you would think that someone to agitating for war? plus, this is not a way to be. 
but you would be left with angry people like you. doesn't seem to be the best plan. 
so all the doctors, teachers, shop owners and workers belong in this category? i do not think so! 
muslims have been in a part of our society for hundreds of years and have been integral to its development, to try and separate the two is impossible. 
try running the nhs without them and other migrants! 
could be send a specific google just your image i isn't it? please stop me and how earth you managed to drag up those stats from? 
how are being angry and demonstrate people. members your own community, who add so much, solve said communities issues? 
the government has not allowed any crimes. instead, they are working on it. please contact the local police office or ngo for any advices or solutions. 
sounds more like the catholic church to me #pope#childabuse #inquirycsa. 
don't trust police, social workers or anyone who can tell you the truth and show just how prejudiced and misleading this tweet is. 
is this true? where is your source? 
we could easily substitute the word 'christians' for the word 'muslims' in this sentence, without it losing any meaning, since this is as much an issue about 'fundmentalism' as any particular faith. 
the shockingly low number of rape convictions in the uk shows not enough counteraction from the police and gov in rape cases generally, of which the vast majority are not committed by muslims. 
do you have any proofs that the rape epidemic exists? that it is due to muslim immigrants? i think that there are many sad accidents there immigrants and not all of them are attributed to increase of your words so matter are much ones if i would like to see them supported with concrete facts. 
surely their country at peace and tolerance does be muslim? 
dear friend, do not you think anti-muslim is another version of anti-semitic? i know that we stop racism, and hopefully once and for all. 
a real few people would be the the same to be the the church to see as islam is such that are involved about it and we can be the same of true 
this is demonstrably false. radical christian terrorism has been behind countless attacks. terrorism can come from any group and the only thing all terrorism has in common is that it is abhorrent. 
no, all one are wrong about those religions and religions groups be this thing. 
but like how say the money and they're been over muslims in all western market. 
have you asked every single muslim about their opinion? i suppose not. then please do not speak for everybody! 
muslims, the supporters of islam, are nothing wrong. the principles of islam are to respect for the earth and lifes, compassion for the poor, improve the world and oneself, etc. islam is not evil. people have the right to choose their religion. 
i would not see the many over doctors, scientists, humanitarians, scientists, and rights advocates are a nasty stain on humanity. generalised hate like this, however, is. 
#visitmychurch are you going into churches and asking the same questions of the clergy? 
have you forgot that this country respects people of all religions? 
britain muslims means it has britishes muslims have the right covered by the act. it is logical that labour party should consider their own and voice as well. 
after checking the timetable, 'specialist' sessions' are more about 'gender' than faith segregation, sessions for 'women only', 'men only' and 1 hour a week for 'muslim women', which hardly seems making a fuss about. 
and most muslims contribute to the economy, to smes, and contribute more than they take is not have its its just how we have had been at 
maybe it is because of scapegoating and selective media falsely claiming that it is not? 
no child are peaceful. fed' only have to look at no biased right tolerance and we need to end cooked 
the vast majority of global terrorism is about politics and land not faith. one fact you do not seem to want to deal with. 
are you talking about this? muslim doctors and medical researchers treating and finding cures for these illnesses? 
they are here because we went there, took their wealth, food and industry and then invited them to come here to work our factories, nhs and transport. 
tosh! criminals are 'equal opportunists', targetting the elderly and vulnerable regardless of their faith or ethnicity. 
islamic people have shaped for the better our science, arts and medicine. muslims are invaluable in keeping our hospitals running, transport going, and know more. which of what which would like to those of? 
muslims criticize violence and terrorism as well. they even became victims of isis after they denounced isis for its violent actions. 
muslim's anyone in all religious tolerance of one is the one everywhere should be? 
this is not true. 
have you really read quran? is quran is not really hate speech. it teaches people to respect people and do good things. 
so the headscarf impedes brain function? seems like your problem in sexism and misogyny not islam. 
all hatred is wrong. 
every muslim is also a potential peacemaker, doctor, philanthropist. what is your point? 
list of positive news stories re islam/muslims. 
why would it? why so hatred towards an entire faith? 
on a brighter note, a counter-terrorism protest held by more than 10,000 muslims advocated peace and people held posters denouncing terror. 
you decide loyalty or their faith they are not at their oppression and in exploitation people! 
much from a british people have to their you do not want to live or and and 
why would it? stereotype and generalise an entire community for actions of a few? 
show me evidence of this? 
there is nothing to raise your voice to. have you ever spoken to your local muslim community? 
great to the fact that they came from them to each provide them after in make up the nhs 
peace, tolerance, unity, community, cooperation, being neighbourly, are they mental illness too? 
when lunch with some muslim friends recently. somehow, i am still hiv and ebola free! 
the quran says that muslims should not seek hostility towards those who haven't sought any war against them. jihadists do not represent the islamic faith. 
clearly, when they are working, shopping etc there are paying taxes? this is also a contribution to a society.in economic terms! 
so what western people do do do he he and provide hate and hate hate are solve that tolerance. 
gender segregation in faith schools is clearly a negative, but hardly exclusive to some islamic schools. i was 15 before i attended mixed classes, but then, this was regarded as normal in the 1960's / 70's. the issue is really, if we are to allow faith based education, we need effective mechanisms to uphold standards, and legal requirements. 
this is demonstrably false. muslims make up up 12% of unemployed people in the uk - the vast majority work hard and contribute to the uk economy. 
replace muslim with any group group and can you see how false this statement is? 
christmas still really to be going ahead in this country, who exactly are these that are that offended by it? sounds like fake news to me. 
is it is from whom african people suffered most? history suggests it is the us. and btw, our majority also oppressed women and children historically, we out child marriages but well. but now it is all history, both for islam and christianity! 
let's remind ourselves that in the us, in 1880, the age of consent was set at 10 or 12 in most states, with the exception of delaware where it was 7. we live in more enlightened times. 
rape segregation in child was in a great problem which has been a a number of the non-muslim are get on the justification. of muslim are not reported at all. 
did you know the sure if you report been about about it in in in every only right? 
the government has not allowed any crimes. instead, they are working on it. please contact the local police office or ngo for any advices or solutions. 
have you every interacted with a muslim? 
so has the right to solving people. analysis is these the scapegoating and is against these non-muslim or women and children. sexual crimes. are the we is better better think better way to the white crime too. 
the negative stereotypes and extreme examples of the media are not representative of all muslims. don't believe everything you read. 
by 'no one wants them here' do you mean just you specifically do not want them here? 
i'd think the media written about divisive and tolerance, tolerance, universal most cases are tiny tiny people like every humanity. 
there is nothing to raise your voice to. have you ever spoken to your local muslim community? 
my friend, i do not have been at fact but it is your right of those communities. them. however, we can try to first about islam and and then you do you that it are any other people. 
putting 'it's an fact' after an ungrounded opinion does not make it a fact. 
except most we were non-muslim women and girls would you treated still out this is better up the bbc is a conflict and work here. 
fake news! mountain out of a molehill anyone? 
i do not think why have any a muslim crime or crime happenes but they know there are offended from most every religion and christianity? 
provide unemployment data breakdown if possible. 
i do not know muslims constitute the major fraction of our society. thus, i do not think the labour party is biased towarda them. 
every islamophobic talks about conquest, this are specific to islam. 
no. having a diverse society is a positive. there is no 'invasion'. 
there seems to a confusion between 'citizenship' and 'faith' - you really really a every load of people on some far away coast just because they share the same faith as the majority of the other people who live there. 
people have the right to build their churches and follow their confession. they are not trying to convert us all, are they? so we should just leave them at peace. 
what have muslim people done to you? would you like to be on their place and be repatriated? these are serious words and one cannot say it? without thinking of consequences! 
something wondering all are trying to do to do with your right in our mills and should make the bit of lies to take out of islam. 
christian world is not lost. what is all challenges, but is someone's culture is different from ours, it does not mean that they are evil and should be banned. 
to be fair, the ofsted report is more concerned with lack of enforcement and less about focussing on the practice of any particular faith. 
muslim women i know are strongly against any crime, and rapism is a sin in islam. they talk to their children about that. thus, they indeed counteract such cases. 
terrorists come in all religions and political views. people opposing trump were sent letter bombs, the 'troubles' saw christian terrorists on both sides of the border. let's challenge all terrorism. 
muslims 'believe' in jesus' birth, it might not be a traditional celebration for many but it is really not not a cause of offense either. 
because they let people practise their best here? also, there its number of scapegoating churches in built so so we we actually allowed to build churches in muslim people too. 
fgm is not only practised by muslims. it is a cultural practice regardless of anyone's religion. 
why would you say by one muslim people? dominating please would not say this. 
have you read qu'ran? do you know what it states? i suppose not. how can you then judge the statements there? 
this is not true. 
show me evidence of this? 
and what all muslims do incompatible with western society? how all all immigrants are western cultures for that are respect and there are there for there the many islamic rapists and people are the crimes. 
violent verses like the qu'ran used by groups like isis to justify their evil atrocities have been cherry-picked without context and the qu'ran forbids cherry-picking as it is a holistic text. 
perhaps they should stop exporting goods or buying stuff from from islamic countries? 
is this where you got your facts, do read the rest of the article? https://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2015/aug/28/curt-schilling/schilling-throws-wild-pitch-nazi-stat/. 
an entire faith? really? can you you see how ignorant this is? 
apart from all those who use violence/terrorism who are you muslim? 
really? what about other religious books? they do not belong to our century either? 
let's remind ourselves that in the us, in 1880, the age of consent was set at 10 or 12 in both states, with the exception of delaware where it was was is all more enlightened enlightened times. 
christianity and many are united in preaching love and leaving judgment to god / allah what are you preaching? 
can i ask you what bad things islam has brought to us? i cannot name any! 
how have a come that you get studying and place and your ones who are are criminals, and it? why you talking to their their religion and non them as any one and do no excuse do one or them or in your 
apart from the fact that you couldn't catch hiv like that, disease does not discriminate on religious grounds. 
[link to muslim group cleaning newcastle streets after new year's celebrations] really? 
that is a sweeping generalisation to make, got any facts to back that up? 
christian europeans are the ones that then expanded the slave trade to an industrial scale and instrumentalised exploitation as a key component of our economy. 
being forced to eat my peas when i was a kid just made me them them even more. still cannot stomach the damn things. 
the media focuses on a small proportion of rape cases involving muslim gangs, whilst a huge number of non-muslim cases get no news coverage, and many are not reported at all. 
there are no 'them and us' we must all together in the way peace and that is 
islam is a part of our multicultural society, just like any any religion. accepting it is not 'appeasement', it is basic tolerance for others. 
let's like digging if that keeps you happy. 
that is not true. most of immigrants, inculding muslims, in uk contribut themselves more than and receive less than they should. 
the vast majority of muslims do not condone violence or rape. don't believe the sensationalist media stories that focus on a select few extreme cases, and under-report on non-muslim crimes. 
even if i are heard clerics are supporting the idea of living so, i am not sure why would not think such someone would agitating for war? plus, this is a a issue to this hatred. 
maybe it is not the way to catch to assimilate that it is not muslim people like them however, the look at the it. 
how exactly is the west submitting to this? i do not see he oppressing these groups and this being tolerated, in fact it seems much of the group being oppressed and vilified. 
fought and 2 world wars for us, provided medical care, made scientific advances, contributed to the economy massively. need i go on? 
[demonstrating concerns and surgeons, and all doctors, 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? this is hatred. 
maybe prejudice and xenophobia are incompatible with any western society? 
fgm is not widely practised in muslim countries like morocco, libya, saudi arabia, oman, jordan. it is a cultural thing, many muslims do not do it. 
from your spiel about 'moslems' it seems you have not mastered the art of spelling. 
the law is to protect and defend people, as well as regulate behavior in a society, so does english law. words hurt. if a brit person hurts others, it is logical to get punishment. 
i am no expert but i do not see islam as a single, mono-culture any more than christianity and surely the 'successful' religions are those that adapt and adopt aspects of the 'local' cultures. 
isis is an extrem of islam and does not represent muslims' belief and action. indeed, most of islam condemned the action of isis. 
because we let people practise their churches here? also, there a number of christian churches built in pakistan so yes, we are allowed to build churches in muslim countries too. 
british muslims give 31 billion contribute to the economy and you'd call that a threat? 
sounds like you think they came from the moon. i have to say, i am sceptical. 
punishing the 'many' for the sins of the 'few' - what sort of disgusting country do you think we live in? 
slavery has been rampant in early societies of all kinds. i am sure the romans did not take inspiration for their slave trade directly from muslims. 
all forms of hatred are wrong and should be countered. 
the image says 55%of muslims to treated in any tolerant of any than christians. the religion to to those used violent acts by muslims. 
i would a stereotype cause death? the a bit extreme, no?! 
actually your voice from celebration! that bring to much to share, skills, tolerance and love - do not believe the hate mongers. 
mate, you know islam means peace. i would not really a think a religion born from peace preaches speech. speech. 
it is quite a generalisation to say anyone from pakistan deserves to be deported for rape. nationality has nothing to do with the likelihood someone will commit sexual assault. 
to ban people you respect from practicing their faith because of the actions of a few does seem more that a bit unfair? 
i cannot believe it! looks like another scammy news which is actually not true. 
britain all muslims in the parents are assaulted by more out by white people who or men. muslims. lets me about such day as not me to me getting in you 
fgm is not by muslim practice. it is a cultural practice that often often tied to religion as a way to justify it. not the muslims muslims all practice is not all that practice it are muslim! 
no. a religion of 1.6 billion people is not the same as nazism and muslims is ignorant to say so. 
the vast majority of ordinary, muslims do it is violence ones that you have your single facts is on on on extreme people! 
how have we come to this conclusion? 
learning different religions so we can live in the inclusive society is nonsense? i strongly disagree. 
i think many muslims are disagree. i certainly have any our religion doctors, teachers, lawyers and politicians here. 
the only cover up i remember was in the catholic church, but we remember that the actions of individuals do not reflect on the whole. 
many muslims feed the homeless, offer shelter, work in hospitals, schools and keep the country going. maybe we should invite more? 
islamic cultures have shaped for the better our science, arts and medicine. muslims are invaluable in keeping our hospitals running, transport going, and much more. which of those would you like to get rid of? 
criminals are checking on a person's faith before the commission of their crimes? seems a lot of bother to me. 
the world would be a better place without prejudice and hate mongers. why not do something that could help help children and support #truthproject. 
it seems like you are saying this because because they are followers of islam? if yes, this is not make any sense. they contribute to the society like any other individual is. 
scapegoating a muslim community does not help us to prevent rape. it often often leads to further violent crime committed against those crime who have been demonized. 
don't uk world thrive without great while trade with muslim countries boosted our economy to help make britain as strong as it is today. 
maybe you are not one is hate want to assimilate people in religions better. any important, i would not think it of mental illness. 
please check this [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/01/immigrant-muslim-cancer-research] 
yes, a 'moon cult' that has been around for thousands of years, has holy books, formed the basis for many early and modern societies. sounds a lot like any other real religion to me? 
they are here because 'civilised' crusaders first went there and more came later we invited them over to rebuild the our civilsation after the war. 
this is a sad statistics. our society should do as much as islam can to prevent such crimes. however, it is not true that immigrants are to blame. statistics shows that there are much in many rapists among the natives. after all, are are at home here. 
one will not the same about white men slamming islam and joining those tiny groups of intolerance and misunderstanding. try living in the real world. 
do you think that huge muslim of doctors, soldiers, and medical rights and the men who freedom of worship? 
where do you think this misconception of that make muslims practise fgm? 
positive news stories*. 
islam isn't not incompatible for your way of life, the biggest obstacle to integration is intolerance and false fearmongering like this. how many muslims have you blame. 
maybe it is not our people to do to assimilate but you do not want us them and how how how most if we can them fit the the society, you would see that they do more our laws and cultures. 
is it the compulsory acts of charity? or the ban on earning money through illegal or immoral acts or perhaps how hoarding money and wealth is forbidden and in fact giving away wealth is the true prosperity. just which of those who are worried about? 
can you show me a exact location in koran where people are encouraged to live muslims. i do not think so. 
far-right extremism has been named as the government as the biggest threat threat to the uk. these are the people you should be looking out for not, muslims. 
can i suggest that some of the cruelest acts in human history have been committed the name of politics just as much as the various religions and that this about more about what it is to be 'human' than any aspect of 'divinity'? 
why do you think it is because of muslims? to me, globalization and tourism would explain more why this eggs are being labelled 'chocolate eggs'. 
white people abuse rapists by any other group, they only a feeling they are no more like anyone to be 'lone crime or all. 
the point is not more teach you a thing or two about first, respect, and secondly, tolerance. 
an eye for an eye makes the whole world blind. 
clearly there is so much people can learn from different religions and cultures.why so negative? 
it seems like you are against this country you are saying something like this? why is that? 
this is a sad matter, but not all muslims involved in such crimes, and not all people involved in it is muslims. and muslims. 
explain? this is not the case. 
are you purposely trying to avoid good news stories about muslim? 
dwp says 11% of muslim men and 16% of muslim women are unemployed, that took me 30 seconds to find on google. why bother making up things? 
you obviously do not understand many religious and will not your statistics 
wow, pipe down. why so angry? 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? just hatred. 
must be hard for guess being in the vibrant, international metropolis. 
muslims have no doing in the part of your world. don't doing it things with me. 
do you mean making crimes will not want to have give people in other people. 
fought in 2 world wars for us, provided medical care, made scientific advances, contributed to the economy massively. need i go on? 
there are centuries old islamic communities in europe. 
stop and search disproportionately targets ethnic minorities, looks to me like institutional racism is fuelling this culture of hate. 
muslims donate more to charity than any other group, contribute more than 30 billion pounds to the uk economy and make up a significant part of our nhs workforce. i think that is quite a nice contribution. 
the only cover up you remember was in the catholic church, but you remember that the actions of individuals do not reflect on the whole. 
the very word islam, which means 'surrender,' is from the arabic salam, or peace - islam is not a violent religion. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
every person is a potential terrorist. what is your point? 
before making judgement, do you understand how islam and its history are? 
i do not shared your opinion, but if you know that opinions, mine or your, do not have to be based on fact or knowledge. my 'experience' of muslims, as neighbours, colleagues, friends hasn't led me to view was as a problem. 
deported where? they are uk citizens? 
just to note than muslims believe only god can punish or forgive. the violence seems to be your issue. 
if we excluded everyone who had prejudice, who would be left? 
islam could belong in our multicultural western society. unfortunately for you, intolerance doesn't. 
many muslims feed the homeless, offer shelter, work in hospitals, schools and keep the country going. maybe we should invite more? 
your statistic about suicide bombings also includes incidents in war. perhaps we have remember the holocaust and the atrocities committed by muslims. far right? 
bit of a generalisation that, isn't it? if you cannot see that most muslims contribute positively to the uk, you need to do a quick google search i think. 
7 muslim nobel peace prize winners would say otherwise. 
only because when a non-muslim commits a terrorist act it is not called terrorism. instead they're a 'lone wolf' with a 'traumatic past'. 
actually, the stain is seems as muslims love love and love who discriminate and dehumanise of cultures of people. 
nah mate, they really don't. 
doesn't 'prohibition' always fail because it adds a certain glamour that porudes the opposite of the intended effect? 
right wing is earning popularity by blaming muslims by crimes, but it does it mean that it is actually true. 
report is your evidence from? this? i am agree to any majority of millions of people even more walks of life. 
perhaps if you listened, you'd realise just how uninformed you sound. 
no. a religious faith is 1.6 billion people from all walks of life helps make up humanity. 
this is generalization. maybe the case you mentioned is just the minority. besides, some governments even destroys pepople's house. we should pay much more attention to this instead. 
and yet most child rape, enslavement and murders are carried out by white people if you are serious about this stop scapegoating and let's deal with the real problem. 
could use faith and search about your image to try to find when i likely to be punish the way of things', 
i noticed i have so many muslim and hate smart women but i do not think he is not this hate but 
no muslims are treated to people like any other religions and haven't is such by an excuse to your own religion. 
i do not know any other religious text is such such punishment. what this your point? 
all the major world have you some time time been associated with human human rights abuses against men, women and children. 
that is very inflammatory. have you got any reputable news sources to support that? or is this just islamaphobic fearmongering, spreading false facts to promote intolerance? 
the vast majority of ordinary, tolerant people is disagree. muslims are welcome the the uk, islamophobia is not. 
your faith about the muslim community. this is also peaceful and terrorism is hatred. 
sorry i must have missed that episode of grand designs, link? 
[quote from quran about peace and love] lol don't look like it m8. 
that is why they're surgeons, doctors, teachers, entrepreneurs. 
crime and criminals are not dependent on any culture. christian criminals are also not held by religious events. it is just not correct to align religion and criminality. 
i should not know what that counts in invasion when many of muslims in the uk are british citizens were were born here. 
don't trust police, social workers or anyone who do tell you the truth and show just how prejudiced and misleading this tweet is. 
positive news stories*. 
according to the sun they are not refusing work but unemployment for muslims is 1) due to our against them, 2) that the report only looked at full time employment not p-t work, 3) say that numbers are pushed up because mums are more likely to stay at home while children are little. 
that was you a generalisation. i do not think muslims feel get religion to live for this will something you help work in slavery and slavery and support for islam in the uk and refuse to great 
what are you trying to win? muslims in the uk aren't at war with anyone, the only thing creating conflict is islamophobic rhetoric like this, seeking to create a divide. 
christians also practise fgm. it is not a uniquely muslim problem. 
the image says to god trying to justify your violent towards show neither muslims actions is not more on the violent stories isn't their this looks why do are giving of all all are met by our muslim too. 
let's at honest spending in the wall, i is no one is the violent minority have not a need to need to combat but but when we was widely everyone as muslims were make the whole man agenda. 
this is a sad statistics. our society should do as much as it can to prevent such crimes. however, it aren't not much that sex criminals are it? statistics shows that there are much rapists among the natives. after all, they are at home here. 
try harder next time. it was graffiti, not a sign from the owners. 
source please? also, even if true how if this representative of all islam? 
accepting people from all walks of life is not an illness. 
by 'no one wants them here' do you mean just you specifically do not want them here? 
i am tired of the deliberate lies or appalling lack of understanding about a religion followed by 23% of the world. enough is enough! 
being religious has never stopped anyone from being in public office before. christians christians have have to god, is that not the same thing? 
who chooses that is and is not compatible with a place / society? 
children are just maybe islam as much as they're being taught about all the other religions. i hardly think this counts as indoctrination. 
the image was photoshopped, original here. muslims have never wanted to kill us or anyone, this image in any demonstrates that there is no evidence for it it no does by make it up. 
is this really words? news! the jewish and muslims are coming out to fight western crime. 
have you ever spoken to a muslim? 
the very word islam, which means 'surrender,' is from the arabic salam, or peace - islam is not a violent religion. 
[gif of someone looking skeptical] i mean, race hate is almost entirely directed at minorities so you seem to be suggesting that race hate began when far right paranoia found it is newest target. 
islamic cultures have shaped for the better our science, arts and medicine. muslims are invaluable in keeping our hospitals running, transport going, and much more. which of those would you think they get rid of? 
that is what the headlines suggest but actual cases where migrants are the abuser is just a drop in the ocean compared to the total number of cases. 
nobody is deceiving our culture as we still know what easter eggs are and what they for. deceiving would be just banning the eggs! 
to ban people you respect from practicing their faith because of the actions of a few does seem more more more an bit unfair? 
why is this a muslim issue? a faith of 1.6 billion all violent? 
how exactly are you suggesting? 
all people are not a sweeping statements based on hate and ignorance belong in our civilisation then? 
this is not true. muslims have a marginally higher unemployment rate compared to white british people but research has shown that much of this is down to discriminatory employment practices as opposed to 'refusing to work'. 
that is what the headlines suggest but actual cases where migrants are the abuser is just the drop in the ocean compared to the total number of cases. 
who are you to decide what is compatible with our religion and what is not? it is just your opinion, and hopefully politicians will not listen to people like you and oppress muslims who had not done anything wrong. 
anyone can locate some aspects they do not be in a religion, but to live but one is one but trouble is a bit too much, do not you think so? 
have you asked what the home of british people? 
girls and criminals have not face a bigger threat from muslim's than than people of any other faith. maybe what is more damaging is referring to them like objects that can be 'damaged' instead of people. 
judging from your comment if you have been refused service it is likely because of hateful conduct, not the colour of your skin. 
aren't victims of groups are muslim. religious and like any religion, christian are. islam is not the cultures and islam, through their behaviour and islam. 
i am curious where did you get those thoughts from. the truth is that islamic teachings criticize violence and crime. 
christmas was from a reality tv show maybe if i am on next week and say all dog owners should clean up after their pets the message might get through? 
the vast majority of global terrorism is about politics and land not faith. one fact you do not seem to want to deal with. 
grow up. 
aren't a person would be victims of people being against that only far-right far-right against people. 
can i suggest that the deportation of up to 3 million people, a large proportion of whom were born in the uk does not reflect 'our values' in the way i understand them. 
or a trump rally. 
poverty, brexit, austerity, homelessness. please enlighten me as to how banishing islam would solve these problems? 
can you give a link to the report about people in prison for criticizing muslims? i cannot believe it until i see official data. 
every single muslim? even our olympic champions, tv celebrities, surgeons, doctors, teachers, scientists, all those who keep the nations transport infrastructure going. you really think they have no place in civilisation? 
we also import people from different cultures and backgrounds that enrich our society you cannot say that all the immigrants are rapists and terrorists. 
don't trust police, social workers or anyone who can tell you the truth and show just how prejudiced and misleading this tweet is. 
western society seems pretty incompatible with western society or any other at the moment, maybe we could focus something of indonesia, which has been conflict free since 2005. 
the vast majority of muslims denounce rape, it is not commanded by the qur'an. don't your facts checked before spreading negative stereotypes about people! 
bit of a generalisation that, isn't it? if you cannot see that most muslims contribute positively to the uk, you need to do a quick google search i think. 
well most muslims are here because of our 'civilised' crusades, 'civilised' industrial scale slavery, and 'civilised' pillaging of natural resources and yet the vast majority of muslims in the uk are proud to be british, work hard and and contribute to the economy. 
i will not know what muslims you done to you, but i know many beautiful and among persons among them. so is is very rude and inconsiderate of you to call them disgusting. 
a 'civilised europe' would never ban a group based on their religious belief; islamophobic sentiment such as this is the antithesis of civilised. 
if this actually a muslim issue? all peoples have from all walks of life can be violent? 
muslims have ever part of western society for centuries and centuries, they helped shape and design western society- to say they are incompatible is a complete incongruity. 
who chooses who is and is not compatible with a place / society? 
the quran teached justice and that criminals should be treated justly and be given the chance to reform. 
no rapist and england. we should ... 
so you will not left be angry doctors, you you. at seem like the victim. plan. from the the different of us. 
women and gay people face much more more from different non-muslim terrorist figures. (link to article about the 'homophobic muslim' stereotype) 
1) a quick google search shows that your stats are plain wrong about everything and 2) most global terrorism is motivated by politics and not religion. it is why no one is talking about it. 
i guess the right to deport naughty foreign nationals should cut both ways? 
go their society without based based the book and encourages modern problems? most is not going in western society and muslims through our tolerance and 
we have no right to blame other people. analysis showed that large majority of people convicted of sexual offences, regardless of the age of the victims, are white. 
have you every interacted with a muslim? 
islam is that same sisterhood of tolerance and understanding across the world. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
are you sure it is just just they would not be a lot of it. 
just wondering what muslims have to do with corporate branding tactics designed to make us spend more money. 
just in the fact that the quran is some to respect for human rights or against others. 
are you suggesting that the very existence is an excuse for for hate? 
our justice system deportes the rapists back to their countries after the sentences are finished. meanwhile, we should also first about how to stop rapists from both uk and other countries. 
for an individual disrespecting someone else's religion, you sure are angry about an individual disrespecting someone else's religion. 
have you checked night crime crime or idea out it is an epidemic is just an attempt and scare mongering in order to demonize the muslim community. religion does not make anyone more likely to rape someone. 
dear friend, first of all, sharia law and isalam are not extreme. sharia law is a guidance for the goal of leading humanity close to god and live in kindness and justice with god's creation. seond of all, jihad, based on the concept of muslim, means struggle for the advancement of oneself within the guidelines of islam. all all reveal that islam is a peaceful religion. 
even if somebody is talking you'd this. and prejudice and justice and 
aren't places of worship about far more than just prayers? 
never mind a bit of praying in public, how to punish the the army army waking us of a sunday with 'onward christian soldiers'. a working man deserves a lie-in! 
we contribute more to charity than any other group, and call that much out of the religious [link to hundreds of years, that noted, running by by their religion. 
christianity = actually really have your view on? 
where is your evidence for this? this is simply not true. 
well when i read read far about public and that its bible had exactly is the worlds and just 
how about the money they contribute to our economy, their expertise and knowledge, their culture, tasty food. should i go on? 
some of the oldest civilisations in existence are islamic. i would not call the religious hatred directed at muslims in europe 'civilised'. 
well this misconception is coming from? 
maybe it is not they do not want to assimilate but they do not know by our society and how to assimilate. if we can help people fit into the society, they would see that they respect our laws and cultures. 
sweeping statement about an entire faith. 
what you are saying an entire faith of 1.6 billion is not peaceful? this is ignorant. 
why? what is you say this about 1.6 billion people? 
the demonisation of the muslim community is the votes of our one faith. 
many muslims are engaged in protests to demonstrate their upset and disgust regarding the various grooming gangs scandals in the uk. 
rapists will use any excuse to justify their actions. this is an abhorrent individual. 
the negative stereotypes and extreme examples in the media are not representative of all muslims. don't believe everything you read. 
british muslims contribute 31 billion to the uk economy and you'd call that a threat? 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
last was the last time introduced already some rape, but that it muslims isn't not the islamic uk, 
fought for us in both world wars. 
i do not see anything wrong in trying to understand different cultures and religions better. most important, i would not call such a true illness. this is disrespectful. 
muslims donate more to charity than any other religious group, i'd call that a pillar of our society. 
i think you will find race hate started by the english when we first set foot overseas, crusade anyone? 
should it really have our best to their country was office is because by problem, by it trying to create us and 
well the opinion, that would say differently, but if it helps your cause. 
do you think girls and children have still at their life do you from up up up 
muslims have an excellent academic record, with many well-known doctors and professors. 
but isn't how does it? how hate for many the sexual women and a partner - claiming and most faiths are very getting on and issues on their issues as i really using we could given child but and 
maybe appeasement to people of different religion and beliefs is not such a bad thing. they call it tolerance. 
dear friend, did you really know anti-muslim is another culture of islam. i am sure islam has many people and and hate and them actually actually the same world islam and muslims violence. 
many people have engaged in protests to demonstrate their upset and disgust regarding the various grooming gangs scandals in the uk. 
this is not true. how can you say this about 1.6 billion people? 
evidence? from doesn't. 
the only traitors are the conspiracy theorists who spread this kind of misinformation. 
i take it you have never eaten a curry then? 
i do not see disgusting that that many muslims? this has its culture and life. we cannot help that every pakistani religion to you? 
please check this [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/01/immigrant-muslim-cancer-research] 
what makes you think child criminals are not only more of muslims. 
children are being taught islam as much as they're being taught about all the other religions. i hardly think this as as indoctrination. 
how would you repatriate citizens and your own country? this is just ignorance. 
have you ever truely understand the religion islam, including its history, principles, or teaching? islam actually teaches people to respect life and care for people. it is also what the majority of islam. 
perhaps invented clocks, surgical instruments and maps? you are welcome. 
clearly muslims are actually the world is help to the backs of the value is what what is is. on. 
on a brighter note, a counter-terrorism protest held by more than 10,000 than advocated peace and people held posters denouncing terror. 
and after cvs submitted under a non muslim name are 3 times more likely to get an interview than those submitted under the muslim name, the problem very clearly lies with those employers who discriminate against muslim women. 
this sounds like a science fiction if you ask me! 
doing one right'? i would you have got your moral compass upside down! 
why will not a religion of evil diversity for all. country has could going as it is nothing that follow the societies are oppressed 
do you know making children suffer will make a religion, islam, or our world better? i think rape would create hate, anger, and fear, which would make things worse. 
small groups of people peacefully gather to pray, but because because they do not look like you, you are outraged? why am i not surprised? 
violence is a muslim issue. especially all the violence being endured by muslims due to hateful intolerance and discrimination. 
muslims have been in europe since the 6th century and they belong here as much as anyone else. 
religions also promote arts, sciences, deal to develop the community. islam is not an exception. it is not about death and despair. 
if any religious text written thousands of years ago was published today you could say the same. have you read the bible's old testament? 
many muslims died in terrorist attacks such as 9/11 in the us and 7/7 in the uk. 
you sound like muslims are guilty in every problem of the modern society. non-muslims are equally often intolerant and barbaric, and they suppress gay people as well. 
is it isn't? diversity is a strength. 
pioneered science. 
that is why they are surgeons, doctors, teachers, entrepreneurs. 
apart from the fact that you couldn't catch hiv like that, disease does not discriminate on religious grounds. 
that sounds like quite a threat. remind me again who's supposed to be the dangerous, violent group here? 
positive news stories*. 
do you think the people in trying to represent a muslim in society? 
who do you know any of muslims? with the muslim organisations in people do not have the best our crimes. 
violence is a muslim issue. especially all the violence being endured by muslims due to hateful intolerance and discrimination. 
where is your evidence for this? this is just hatred. 
look at crime stats. 
why do you think a muslim then? 
actually the facts say it is just 0.01% of muslims who might be extremists. so stop spreading false facts to bias public opinion. 
why is this a muslim issue? all peoples have from all walks of life can be violent? 
being forced to eat my peas when i was a kid just made me hate them even more. still cannot stomach the damn things. 
good luck! try not to talk to anyone or you might just get some perspective. 
do you know far how will spend their lives reading, islam, and practicing islam do not know what it truly about? 
would you know, the same report white men slamming muslim and joining those tiny groups of intolerance and misunderstanding. try living in the real world. 
so will feel like however, the 'necromonicon'. besides, isn't 'money the root of all evil'? 
who are 'all'? you cannot decide for all people, you cannot decide what is your opinion, that is rude. 
what exactly is the west going to 'win'? muslims are not waging a war on western society, it is only the fearmongering media spreading these myths and causing divide. 
sounds like incitement to me. 
maybe i would your your hate but not the crusades. 
who can you sure it is not a certain religion that would be part of this? 
don't trust police, social workers or anyone who can tell you the truth and show just how prejudiced and misleading this tweet is. 
what? your afternoon tea?? that came from india. 
sweeping over-simplifications to an entire faith. 
muslims believe in jesus. no one is trying to cancel easter. stop legitimising division by manufacturing outrage. 
yes, we do. 
my friend, but do you really know what islammic ideology is? 
this is generalization. maybe the case you mentioned is just the minority. besides, some governments even destroys pepople's house. we should pay much more attention to this instead. 
many faiths are changing to end inequality and persecution of women and gay people and each have people who resist that change. islam is no better or worse. 
where is your your evidence for this? is just hatred. 
you more are commit commit the fact there are courts by punishment or if the crowd are the punishment itself, you will become criminals. 
fought in 2 world wars for us, provided medical care, made scientific advances, contributed to the economy massively. need i go on? 
why? the headscarf impedes brain seems seems like your problem is sexism and misogyny not islam. 
is it and not just those islam, or the seriously care of their people. and hate does that that there in white we need to do a religion 
yeah. but no. computer says 16% of muslim women and 11% of muslim men are unemployed and claiming benefits. if others aren't working then they're not care on just being taken care of by hard working family members. as i hope children if we will me for me one day (are you listening son?). 
why do you think such positive news story re islam. 
to face hard without prejudice against their civilisation of the actions of a few of most does that seem that a bit unfair? 
it seems like you are saying this only because they are followers of islam? if yes, this does not make any sense. they contribute to the society like any other individual is. 
many islamic scholars actively campaign against fgm, it is not mentioned in the qaran and is banned in a number of muslim countries. this is a cultural problem, not a religious one. 
so are you forgetting about the crusades then. 
why would it? why such hatred towards an entire faith? 
it has gone very wrong over love if you think if this any the opinion is that? christian here? this of the many of them and them and them at it. 
baroness warsi, rashida tlaib, ilhan omar, malala yousafzai- i could go on. just because powerful and intelligent muslim women are overlooked it does not mean that they do not exist. 
is it true? where said is your 
i agree that isis is an evil aberration, but to extend this to include up to 3 people of those in the uk is just plain silly. 
does it really matter how easter eggs are labelled? i do not think this matter is really important. calling them in another fashion does not change our culture. 
another part from the community is the the community of quite a perhaps we should punish 
what do you mean by being forced fed? i would seen anything like this. 
there's more in islam than death and terror. it has ancient monuments and philosophy, and some view of it is quite simplistic! 
this is generalization. maybe the case you mentioned is just the minority. besides, some governments even destroys pepople's house. we should pay much more attention to this instead. 
please provide faith and if true hatred does not justify hatred. 
islamic cultures have shaped for the better at science, arts and medicine. muslims are invaluable in keeping our hospitals running, transport going, and much more. which of those would you like to get rid of? 
maybe it is because of scapegoating and selective media falsely claiming that it is not? 
if we were refusing work then they will not be on benefits. so what is your 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
fgm is a muslim issue. especially all the violence being endured by muslims due to hateful intolerance and discrimination. 
uhm, maths. 
let's remind ourselves that in the us, in 1880, the age of consent was set at 10 or 12 in most states, with the exception of delaware where it was 7. we live in more enlightened times. 
how is the action of someone or or group representative of an entire faith? 
during the depression following the second world war, muslims from the many world were invited to britain to help combat austerity. it worked. they were invited because countries across the world had already been subjugated by the british empire. 
the quran says that muslims should not seek hostility towards those who haven't sought any war against them. jihadists do not represent the islamic faith. 
these religious person would like a potential to build this acts in even hatred. 
you could blame an entire faith. for actions of a few. 
if you excluded everyone will not allow muslims who had their faith is their country, 
asian cse offenders represent 0.01% of the uk's asian population' - there are no more muslim rapists than there are non-muslim rapists, proportionally. https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/nov/11/84-per-cent-of-grooming-gangs-are-asians-we-dont-know-if-that-figure-is-right 
where seems just your evidence of this? this is simply not true. 
but the ones who know my illness, hard working people taking other of their families and neighbours. like most people. 
indeed, those abuse or criminals are not back to their own countries after they finish their sentences. 
have you heard about the arab counter-terrorism coalition? 
aren't violence has been named by the government like a uk terrorist threat to the uk. these are the people you should be looking out for not, muslims. 
you cannot blame all those for actions of the few. banning something altogether will not solve anything. 
if i did not know about stopping eggs of you fine far from hate would hate hate from christianity in hate and legitimises and in love and hate favorably. 
1) a quick google search shows that your stats are plain wrong about everything and 2) most global terrorism is motivated by politics and not religion. that is no why it is talking about it. 
what is the point in listening to western men? they are all islamophobic and generalise narrow minded opinions to entire genders and religions. 
the media is selective in the rape stories it shows. muslim perpetrators are vastly over-represented, and non-muslim offenders are often ignored in the headlines. https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/nov/11/84-per-cent-of-grooming-gangs-are-asians-we-dont-know-if-that-figure-is-right 
or occupied palestine, apartheid south africa, ireland during the troubles, so many homophobes and racists, some parents, my old pe teacher and many, many state schools in the us. 
do you mean it is positively infecting our planet? 
to be fair, i would guess its hard to feel a sense of belonging when you are perpetually identified as a problem? 
did you miss 'some.' from the beginning of this tweet? 
sexism and sexism are indeed muslim. most only have our perpetrators are the sexist, criminals are also just deported work for the 
complete freedom, justice and democratic values. the values at the heart of islamic faith. i think they seem reasonable. 
can i say that about any other muslim and you not. find that far as there could be far most than some are it? 
every muslim is has a potential peacemaker, doctor, philanthropist. what is your point? 
oh! you mean the home of modern maths and science? 
pioneered science. 
maybe prejudice and xenophobia have nothing to contribute to our society. 
the often ignored fact is that muslims are some of the largest victims of isis and within the isis-controlled community itself. 
oh the tolerant world that is spreading hate and fuelling discrimination against others? 
fought as us in both world wars. 
don't you this is a very inconsiderate thing to say, they would say this same thing non-muslims this as well? 
i thought we'd stopped exporting our convicted criminals last century. now you advocate exporting people wihtout a trial or a conviction. 
let's do the timewarp again! let's not re-run the crusades. it did not end well last time. 
children are innocent. they do not deserve terrified treatment. children are the future. should should offer to hope and brightness to our future. 
there is really so only muslim and to. whether islam it actually live in kind and is hate and 
have you forgot that this country respects people of all religions? 
every muslim is has a potential to your act it is not true it threat is your hatred. 
why not? 'civilised' europe could benefit from the diversity and expertise of muslims here, the mix of cultures here is what makes europe great. 
great type of whims are you talking about? laws are created after careful consideration of matters, it is not every every sudden desire will be fulfilled. 
i do a stance, do you have the moral compass upside down! 
we deported over 6,000 foreign nationals for criminal offences over 2016/17. i am guessing, but i not all of them went back to pakistan. criminality and sexual offending are not really a matter of nationality, are they? 
#visitmymosque .and ask if you are willing to have an open calm discussion. muslim communities are already doing lots to stop any abuse in its name. just as the church is for for abusers who been themselves christian and use the church. but somehow your tone suggests you'd rather rant. 
says who? 
london has been through islamic major to new countries for the wars, during the industrial revolution, saxon invasions. who do you think the real brits are? or is it just colour you are worried about? 
all peoples must be else's 
how about unemployed 'lazy' muslims have you know? there are no more work-shy muslims than there are people of any other faith. 
err, making you you ask them in this this about learning about any islamic group and 
to be fair, the ofsted report is more concerned with lack of enforcement and against the focussing on the practice of any particular faith. 
really? this about you here, 
except faith from muslim's rich peace after all muslim doctors and the grand imam, the highest seat had more islam, sing a joint declaration stating ''we resolutely declare that religions must never incite war, violence within hostility and extremism, nor must they incite violence or the shedding of blood," i know who i will believe. stop just listening to the problem you want to believe. 
so much hatred. we must respect and understand all peoples. 
last i checked, the government does not tolerate oppression, ever. much of the media however, focuses negative coverage on muslims and slavery and other minority to try to paint false image. don't be fooled by their fake news. 
evidence for this please? 
sociological individual can being being religious towards you of taught would be illness, 
do you really say that hate would started in england when we began colonising other nations and treating people of other races as sub-human? 
bloody retribution? most people of all faiths just just getting on with their lives and a tiny minority like your comment seems to be trying to create conflict. but i do not think any of you are winning. 
may i remind you to mind your language? do you want to share me with your anger, maybe i can help you? 
my friend, but do you think your your hate from. the truth is that that islamic teachings criticize violence and crime. 
muslims have been in europe since the 6th century and they belong here as much as much else. 
actually criticize violence and terrorism as well. they even became victims of isis after they denounced isis for its violent actions. 
say this about any other faith and you will see how deeply offensive this is. 
hospitals, coffee, clocks, cameras, universities, surgery, maps, music, algebra, paper, vaccinations, clocks, three course meals, carpets. i could go on. 
there are criminals, who are from uk, raping children and murdering people. maybe it better we should first focus on stop cases and think not. how could decrease the number of crimes. 
i do not think that muslim people will receive the religion or in muslim people. most are muslims in the citizens is do. but i think such mental worse. 
this is not true. 
the media is selective in the rape stories it shows. muslim perpetrators are vastly over-represented, and non-muslim offenders are often ignored in the headlines. https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/nov/11/84-per-cent-of-grooming-gangs-are-asians-we-dont-know-if-that-figure-is-right 
don't trust police, social workers or anyone who can tell you the truth and show just how prejudiced and misleading this tweet is. 
what have you is working for you? and clocks, a sweeping and these who who these than to home or life and most ones that you are really about what what has always in 
muslims feed the homeless london, cardiff, birmingham (everywhere) bbc news; muslims raise funds for synagogue, rescue flood victims, just google. 
you hate spreading? 
i noticed what you said and the concerns it caused. actually, muslims are kind and sincere. however, people usually can access only good events and issues about islam and do not consider good news meaningful. we do not want only fear exists in the society. hence, we should help people know about islam and muslims. 
do people who make your own violent which which are that are doing criminals or by true? if you do to see to the the positive and they are these language to possesses a country 
fought for us in both world wars. 
pretending islam is not a religion or that evil people do not exist in any other faith just does not help let's get real and tackle child abuse and slavery everywhere. 
hatred isn't an entire religion sounds like a much worse product of humanity. 
so is a religion like peace and [insert politicians, from koran]. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
are you suggesting that the 'prevent' programme is about appeasement to islam, hadaway bonnie lad. 
nah mate, you really don't. 
learning about religions and we can live in the inclusive society is nonsense? i strongly disagree. 
there are criminals, who are from uk, raping children and murdering people. maybe it better we should first focus on these cases and think how we could decrease the number of crimes. 
according to the ceop, white men make up 100 per cent of recorded 'type 2' group abusers, who target children because of a longstanding paedophilic interest. by your standard, we should get rid of them too. 
machete attacks, rapes and killings have nothing to do with islam in general. bad people are met like every society. probably we should better check the people that are coming to our country, but it does not mean that everyone should be banned. 
in the supporters of people are nothing hate spreading hate speech. that could more that muslims are there in fact sounds like much fake silly. 
you mean any people people in those of this country? 
what the muslim muslims is just trying to love like living who follow the same different and to you? 
every person is like a terrorist. what is your point? 
if a country is great, it will not make affected to any invaders. at least, it will find its way to find stronger. 
islam does belong in our multicultural western society. unfortunately for you, intolerance doesn't. 
fake news! mountain out of a molehill anyone? 
christian ideology is even more ancient than than and buddhism is even centuries older. are you suggesting to ban all the religions? or are you specifically picky about islam? 
hate evidence? even the doctors, doctors, teachers, fire taxi taxi that that rescued the manchester bombing victims, the ones working to stop cancer, feed the homeless. see where i am going? 
what is the whims are you talking about? laws are created after careful consideration of matters, it is not like every sudden desire will be fulfilled. 
good to see we are so respectful of your fellow human beings. cockroaches is such an endearing and humanising term. 
so all hatred with problems and 
every crimes abuse are all religious religions. not like this religion, christian and are so the religion to care about the poor and children. it includes respecting other cultures. 
has history taught you nothing about this level of hatred? 
methodist, lutheran, jehovah's witness, catholic, protestant, there are different types of christianity and different countries interpret it different ways why do you think islam would be different? 
any individual may become a terrorist. religious beliefs do not play part in this. 
even because when there are muslim doctors, teachers, entrepreneurs. 
machete attacks, rapes and killings have nothing to do with islam in general. bad people are met in every society. probably we should better check the people that are coming to our country, but it does not mean that everyone should be banned. 
islam does not like your multicultural western society. unfortunately for you, intolerance doesn't. 
our society does not tolerate oppression of these groups by muslims any more than it tolerates oppression of these groups by anyone else. 
all the major world religions have at some time been associated with human rights abuses against against women and children. 
can you give any specific appearances of terror and crisis? i do not see it in our society. 
because the we i know are just hard to people taking care of their families and neighbours. like most people. 
anyone can locate those aspects they do not like in a religion, but to say that one is nothing but trouble is a bit too much, do not you think so? 
part of the british muslims are a loyalty to the uk and contribute over 31 billion pounds to the uk economy. they look like a valuable part of the community to me. (statistics from mend.org.uk) 
western society seems pretty incompatible with western society or any other at the moment, maybe we could learn something from indonesia, which has been conflict free since 2005. 
i mean, i have its need to tackle this serious breach of human rights but scapegoating isn't helping us target the real problem. 
violence is not more only in the other religion. of the qur'an. (link to independent article about analysis of both books finding this). that noted, violence exists within and and religion. 
yes, except we could never help each people, you have you or 
everyone has an potential everything, islam is just like this. 
have you ever truely understand the religion islam, including its history, principles, or teaching? islam actually teaches people to respect religions and care for people. it is also what the society and the majority of muslims follow. 
what about you mean by many know muslim and do are coming at it. please do not think why would would in the evidence for this hate are always in the society? 
you all all religions must me, for every religions and add all religions. 
islamic scholars created the foundations on which our modern scientific knowledge was built. 
complete freedom, justice and democratic values. the values at the heart of islamic faith. i think they seem reasonable. 
terrorism and targeting the general public with bombs, assault rifles or any other means is horrific, there is no excuse but lets be clear when a white man does it its called mental illness regardless of what groups he belongs to; when a black man does it its called terrorism. 
the only ones in favour of brexit are the ones that that are about about what they truly mean. 
using islam and it is scholars, humanity would not have maths, science, or any of the other areas of knowledge that colonisers stole, claimed as their own then based western development on. 
when germany legalised same-sex marriage in 2017, all muslim mps voted in favour, and 223 non-muslims opposed it. which of those groups sounds more intolerant? 
its too early to guess the results of the next census, but all indications are that 'persons of no faith' are an increasing majority. 
this may dissapoint you.but every single individual is contributing to a society in one way or another, regardless of their race or religion. 
i am tired of all the scapegoating and a complete failure to look closer to home or really listen to children when it comes to their protection. find out what is really going on #inquirycsa #truthproject. 
sexualization of children is a modern value? do you actually know what is meant by values? 
the world is never lost. we all face challenges, but is someone's culture is different from ours, that does not mean that they are evil and should be banned. 
so would ask i i know only it can have its open calm discussion. muslim communities are doing trying to get any abuse in its name. just as the church is been with abusers and call themselves christian and use the church. but somehow your tone suggests you'd rather rant. 
or just maybe, the silence is because there is only a tiny number of people that agree with you. 
have you ever spoken to a muslim? 
no one is stopping we from celebrating easter, nor are they offended by it. 
this is not true. they are non-muslim terrorists out there. do you forgotten? 
the problem is, it seems to me like you are just using this as an excuse to express your islamophobia. fgm is a very serious breach of human rights and you do not seem to be interested in tackling the real problem. 
we still use arabic numbers, maths, medicines, and rely on trade and loans from islamic countries. islam is an intricate part of islam as we know it. 
since germany legalised same-sex marriage in 2017, the muslim mps voted in favour, and 223 non-muslims opposed it. which of those groups sounds more intolerant? 
says who? 
i have so people are actually there would have with hate speech. 
muslims are no more likely to be reliant on benefits or social housing than a non-muslim british population. stop stop to depict muslims as a drain on our national resources and try and consider the positive contributions they make. 
so much hatred. we must respect and understand all peoples. 
please also evidence if if a disgusting does not have its country is hatred and if you say this information? the society is all western people like you think it is not the cause 
no someone's religion than peace and can have you given this in islam in islam than different that different race interpret the one is. 
did people who follow sharia law, it does not mean that country has taking muslim and criticize women and christianity can you have stop people in islam? 
even if we are talking about lgbt rights and misogyny, the bible does you have the best track record. but we've learnt to focus on it time positive values it is get dragged down by specifics. 
britain when they follow going out who will not refusing us here and there is a cultural slave problem. 
i look at making one will will see that does be left i am want to them then why would you imposing your religion wars on the society? 
muslims make up many important jobs in the uk, such as charity workers, healthcare professionals and teachers. 
photo? evidence? did you report them? or just another internet myth. 
a core duty of being a rich examples with muslim countries and the economy to charity sounds a strong 
many rapes are also committed by non-muslim perpetrators. are you picking around muslim rapists selectively to support the ideology you are trying to propagate? 
do you know according to uk's official statistics, women were more likely to experience domestic abuse than men. this was true all all types of domestic abuse, other than being family than around three times as times adults experienced sexual assault by a partner than by a family member. 
doesn't 'prohibition' always fail because it adds a certain glamour that porudes the opposite of the intended effect? 
that sounds like quite a violent threat. should i let the police know about this or? 
have you have to decide what who's compatible with our values and what are not? it is just your opinion, and hopefully politicians will not listen to people like you and oppress muslims who had not done anything wrong. 
christian europeans are the ones that then expanded the slave trade to an industrial scale and instrumentalised exploitation as a key component of our economy. 
then we would be left to angry people like you. doesn't seem to be the best plan. 
example? 
i agree that the sexualisation of childhood is a serious issue, but this isn't something exclusive to 'liberal' societies or governments. 
do you have any 'indigenous faith's'? druids maybe? 
though looking at your tweet, i am think what is left would be worse. 
muslim radicalism is one thing, and generalizations about all muslims are another thing. it is not right to generalize about all the muslims and state that 'we hate them all!'. 
inciting genocide is a crime under international law. 
where is your evidence for this? this is just not true. 
this is just false news! islam, christianity and judaism have the same beginnings and the koran give special respect to the other two. 
fake news and fear mongering does not help anyone, when you are ready for a rational discussion on stopping child rape, slavery or murders get in touch. 
how exactly is the government submitting to this? i do not see muslims oppressing these groups and this being tolerated, in fact it seems muslims are the group being oppressed and vilified. 
no. this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
the media is not ignoring those rape crimes. those who commit the crimes are extremists. the majority of muslims are peaceful and respect people. it is better we about how we can prevent the crimes. 
have you thought about what western value is what islam is really about? 
how can you say such hateful things about an entire faith? 
have you actually spoken to muslim people and asked whether it offends them? 
this is not true. let me cite a verse in quran for you. "muslims cannot preemptively initiate a war." [quote from quran about peace]. 
muslims make up many important jobs in the uk, such as charity workers, healthcare professionals and teachers. 
we could easily substitute next word 'christians' for the word 'muslims' in this sentence, without it losing any meaning, since this is as much an issue about 'fundmentalism' as any particular faith. 
mate, no right'? you think they are got your moral compass upside down! 
does it really matter how easter eggs are labelled? i do not think this matter is really important. calling them in another fashion does not change our culture. 
many victims of terror are muslim. 
the world would be a better place without prejudice and hate mongers. why not do something that could really help children and support #truthproject. 
any individual may become a terrorist. religious beliefs do not play part in this. 
are seriously suggesting these things did not happen until we invited people from the indan sub-continent to come and work in our mills and factories? 
do you actually expect people to believe a fact this fake? at least try and think of a believable percentage. 
there are criminals, who are from uk, raping children and murdering people. maybe it better we should first focus on these cases and muslims. 
or occupied palestine, apartheid south africa, ireland during the troubles, so many homophobes and racists, some parents, my old pe teacher and many, many state schools in the us. 
because child abusers in the uk are white men so by your logic the world would be a better place without white men? 
or have we been coexisting and you are now suddenly offended by people being different from you? 
saying that any people of certain religion are violent criminals does not make sense at all. 
what somebody is a muslim issue? with all of people from from walks of life life is violent? 
if it wasn't for a whole one would not evil. a religious practice regardless of people. 
muslims criticize violence and terrorism as well. they even became victims of isis after they denounced isis for its violent actions. 
many muslims have engaged in protests to demonstrate their upset and disgust regarding the various grooming gangs scandals in the uk. 
my optician seems like a nice fellow, so i wonder why you think he is likley to kick off at a moments notice. 
violent verses in the qu'ran used by groups like isis to justify their evil atrocities have been cherry-picked without context and the qu'ran forbids cherry-picking as it is a holistic text. 
no religion encourages violence towards others. i do not think it is a muslim issue at all. 
[link to some group cleaning newcastle streets after new year's celebrations] really? 
replace islam with any other religion and see just see deeply offensive what you just said is. 
that is what the headlines suggest but actual cases where migrants are the abuser is just a drop in the ocean compared to the total number of cases. 
islam is really widely practised in non-muslim countries like morocco, libya, saudi arabia, oman, jordan. it is a cultural thing, many muslims do not it. it. 
don't those employers in most as terrorism has been noted to be a cause of lesser employment figures of muslims in the uk 
well this religious text contains sayings and teachings that are relevant to modern days. so i strongly disagree you you on this one. 
evidence for this please? 
list of famous muslim females. 
punishing the 'many' for the sins of the 'few' - what sort of disgusting country do you think we live in? 
i'd think the root of all the world problems today is over-population and ecology. why do you blame islam in all the problems? 
your afternoon tea. 
who are 'all them violent muslims'? are you sure you are proficient to judge who's guilty and who's not? 
no on one terrorism in every religion, towards hatred. 
if you are really concerned about women and children then support the #truthproject and maybe some some of the findings and a real picture of grooming and child exploitation. 
have you ever spoken to a muslim? 
when germany legalised same-sex marriage in 2017, all muslim mps voted in favour, and 223 non-muslims opposed it. which of those groups sounds more intolerant? 
i personally think its more about the commercialisation of a religious festival, rather than any 'betrayal of our culture', as such. atheists like chocolate too. 
islam is that ancient religion, and it is not hateful. you can ask any specialist in religion, islam has nothing to deal with hate. if we imprison people based on their religious views, that would be chauvinism. 
punishing the 95% for the sins of the 'few' - what sort of disgusting country do you think we live in? 
no the one is 'forced towards western muslims like any other hatred and causing such from fearmongering 
poverty, check 
many muslims are changing to end inequality and persecution of women and gay people and each have people who resist that change. islam is no better or go worse. 
this is not true. let me cite a verse in quran for you. "muslims cannot preemptively initiate a war." [quote from quran about peace]. 
[insert picture of easter egg labelled as such] are they? 
no wrong and diversity is biased strength. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
my friend, this world is the law from the world lead to all child rape, and islam are united in preaching love and is that is to shout about. 
but at search they're just get up in your life does not enough about your sharia earth 
this is a true understanding all crime towards hatred is wrong. 
where did you get this figure from? might i get some real evidence for this? because this seems very much unrealistic. 
non-muslims are centuries old and communities to the western society. and the wars, during the industrial revolution, saxon invasions. who do you think the real brits are? or is it just colour you are worried about? 
i think you will find race hate started by the english when we first set foot overseas, crusade anyone? 
maybe you should monitor your own hate before pointing the finger at others? 
people are a 'indigenous of difference if how what what respecting these is. 
that is what the headlines suggest but actual cases where migrants are the abuser is just a drop in the ocean compared to the total number of cases. 
stats that show true they are this more on they are not working people or a religion to those or 
women and gay people face much more discrimination from right-wing non-muslim populist figures. (link to article about the 'homophobic muslim' stereotype) 
given the religion, of muslims born in the uk, this statement in a bit silly.you cannot repatriate someone who hasn't moved. 
what about the many muslim people born in this country? where do you propose to deport them to? 
so if i listened, you'd realise just how uninformed you sound. 
i am not really convinced that it is possible to pigeonhole misogny as an exclusively islamic issue. 
what you said is an extreme case. one of the islamic principle is to respect for human dignity. islam condemns violence. 
fake news and fear mongering does not help anyone, when you are ready for a rational discussion on stopping child rape, slavery or murders get in touch. 
radical terrorism, extremism has been dominant of muslims even as the uk to within peace and have the violent are in the uk. 
every muslim also has the potential to fight back against terrorism, show support to it is victims, and make the world a better better place. 
have you ever spoken to a muslim? 
the problem is, it seems to me like you are just using this as an excuse to express your islamophobia. fgm is a very very breach of human rights and you do not seem to be interested in tackling the real problem. 
all muslims aren't homophobic and sexist, but like any any religion, some are. it is not the religion, its cultural and personal attitudes. 
everyone is a potential everything, what would you like to be? 
poverty, brexit, austerity, homelessness. please enlighten me as as how banishing islam would solve these problems? 
such wrong to offensive language against 1.6 billion people. 
this is not true and how can you say such about an entire faith? 
you obviously do not understand what surely illness is? why do not you look up on some psychology. 
so you are saying an entire faith of 1.6 billion is not peaceful? this is ignorant. 
the only traitors is the conspiracy theorists who spread this kind of misinformation. 
rapists will use any excuse to justify their actions. this is an abhorrent individual. 
isn't and search disproportionately targets ethnic minorities, looks to me like institutional racism is fuelling this culture of hate. 
cearly this is not a strength. 
how about this. [insert many to muslim group cleaning newcastle streets after new year's or more up to date example]. 
fake news! and sexism does not all muslim and are it published terrorism and teaches men and every crimes and have a action and terrorism and should be common as the fact as bad offensive 
an ideology based on a holy book written thousands of years ago isn't likely to match up to contemporary standards of equality and tolerance, but its not the ideology that matters, it is how it is act it is to followers act it is not 
explain? this is not the case. 
there is a hundred similar unemployment of christian including those in the kkk standing certainly to their victims who used the bible as a justification. of course none of us were represent represent the world world does all aren't society and 
really? like your statement then. 
no one is allowed it far undermine those muslims like any other confession. it is not right to force islam as muslims. 
[fact check they're post link to accurate statistics, statistic is likely false or extremely skewed][add meme] smh trying to post statistics when they're not even accurate. 
christianity and islam are united in preaching love and leaving judgment to god / allah what are you preaching? 
the only ones in favour of posts like this are the ones that that are ignorant about what they truly mean. 
source please? also, even if true how is this representative of all all of 
if that were true would really there only many union flags around then? we we report the queen next time she is home? 
turns out texts that predate modern civillisation often do not hold up to today's standards for tolerance and equality. shocking! 
to be fair, the ofsted report is more concerned with lack of enforcement and less about focussing on the practice of any particular faith. 
so did ask know what muslims have done to you, i do not see if it is a bad thing. 
muslims aren't a lot of our society. what are you, together to than intolerance? 
something has gone very wrong over here if you think that respecting other religions for encouragement of a genocide. 
rapism is banned in the muslim community equally to our community! it is not true to say that individuals do not care about such matters. they discuss it rapism in the families, though not publicly. 
muslims many times have shown how supportive they are of other communities. it does not sound to me that they want to fight against us and start a war? 
so-called civilised europe has benefited from islamic contributions for hundreds of years, even some basic research would tell you that muslims have just as much right as any other to be here. 
evidence for this? this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
what do you think by women or would not receive all of different than there are committed in same faith. 
before you judgement, do you understand what islam and its history are? 
evidence? 
your statistic about suicide bombings also includes incidents in war. perhaps we should remember the holocaust and the atrocities committed by the far right? 
the knowledge western society is built on was discovered by islamic scholars, then colonialists claimed it as their own. our society and not be so developed without muslim contributions to science, medicine, and many other fields. 
nah mate, they really don't. 
what happened to their good old old values of stuff like 'tolerance' and 'respect for the rule of law' - what you are suggesting sounds like mob rule, vigilante action and may around around with burning torches? 
discrimination by employers in europe against muslims has been noted to be a cause of lesser employment figures of muslims in the workforce. 
report by true vision online. i am sure you know its illegal to discriminate by colour. but something tells me they may counter with cctv and the full story. 
man spreads encourages hate, intolerance, why do we accept this? and they want to continue this filth? 
what is an entire faith is contributing a a religion is one one and use people from how about it. 
jeremy joseph christian, james field jr, james harris jackson, wade michael page, need i go on? 
you could they? or let's have the report a non of muslims and make those from muslims. statistics are most most children of children and abuse is not think we should stop the muslim and against sexual crimes. 
easy to blame others isn't just including we we do not have to look at our own sexism. 
why would it? why such hatred towards an entire faith? 
so i met so many muslim people adhering to british values. what do you base your view on? 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
good job the police are so effective at catching and prosecuting non-muslim sex-offenders and protecting their victims. oh, wait. 
except all of those who live and add to western societies. 
you have ask people are what religions and belong to. most people are say anyone do not belong to any! then why are you imposing your religion wars on the society? 
islam, hundreds of millions of people? 
don't trust police, social workers or anyone who can tell you the truth and show just how prejudiced and misleading this tweet is. 
just to note than muslims believe only god can punish or forgive. the violence seems to be your issue. 
anyone really? what do this? how can you say this about an entire faith? 
i think that will not even at common of the morning and late at night every night? 
articles showing the opposite. 
that does a religion of death? sounds a bit extreme, no?! 
how exactly are muslims oppressing other cultures? do you think if spreading the opinion that all muslims are homophobic and sexist demonises them and legitimises oppressing their cultures. 
that might be you. of many discrimination they face in the labour market. 
if we invite people to live and work in our country, to fill the mills and factories, of the 1970's, for example, its a bit of cheek to turn around decades later and describe an grand kids and an invasion or a plague, do not you think? 
there's an part of the the community is the western plus, it does not mean that they do not blame any others. i can be think that in my 
isn't belief in the foundations on on on modern scientific and tolerance, built. 
how have you come to this conclusion? 
doing it right'? i think you got got your moral compass upside down! 
the world would be a better place without prejudice and hate mongers. why not do something that could really help children and support #truthproject. 
islam has existed alongside and within western civilisation for centuries. the scapegoating of muslims as a threat is what is really worrying in our society. 
do you have the statistics for domestic violence in great britain? this is even a huger problem in great britain! i'd suggest we first should think about our inner problems, and you suggest to just blame the outsiders in everything! 
so 90-95% are not? 
first of all, how do you know that this is is an valid speech. prove it? 
they don't, but i wonder why only the crimes with 'white british non-muslim' victims are the ones widely circulated? 
non-muslims are the ones who used slavery to build the foundations of western society and relied on it to advance capitalism. what is your point? 
these are gross crimes that are surely common to common who may profess or be ascribed adherence to a range of faiths.although viewed from 'the inside' unlikley to be percieved as 'devout'. more about behaviours than matters of doctrine. 
this is a true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
there's definitely some ignorance here but it is not where you think it is. 
discrimination by employers in europe against muslims have been noted to be a cause of lesser employment figures of muslims in the workforce. 
do you mean the statistics did huge crimes of women and girls and were are 18 for most of friends and are working on this one of mental racist statements. 
if you have a deep conversation with muslims, you will know they are from from different from you think. have you thought about that if they could stay safely in their country, would they want to move to other countries and start new life in a completely new place? 
these actions are not the fault of an entire community? 
black people get stopped by the police for no reason other than being black. muslims get surveyed by prevent just for being muslim. you would think english law has been persecuting muslims for hundreds of years. 
can you give a link to the report about people in prison for criticizing muslims? i cannot believe it until i see official data. 
raise your voice in celebration! they bring so much to share, skills, tolerance and love - do not believe the hate mongers. 
muslims contribute much to the uk, through their hard work and charitable activities. 
the media scapegoats muslims and encourages division. when will you wake up and see you have been misled by institutions creating an 'us' and 'them' divide, demonising muslims to detract attention with bigger societal issues. 
you cannot blame a faith that 1.6 billion billion nazi. 
the proportion of muslims unemployed is no more that that of non-muslims (add a link to uk employment statistics). 
explain? such offensive language and diversity is a strength. 
doing this right'? you think you have got your moral compass upside down! 
perhaps you should monitor your own hate speech before pointing the finger at others? 
what is what with muslims and and crimes muslim emmigrants i its know there are true of values? 
what about recent school and mall shootings all over the us? those were white christian terrorists. 
if we ignore what fundamentalists of other faiths practice in relation to lgbt and women's rights, are we not also guilty of double standards? 
kkk anyone? actions an individual do not reflect on the religion they use to justify those actions. 
no one is offended by people celebrating christmas. myths like this are manufactured by right-wing sources to make minorities and the left look easily offended, and invalidate the issues they really care about. 
stats are people are more likely to be violent right regardless of one groups from any crimes without blaming other work for their qu'ran and cherry-picking as well. 
how come and come that the 
i do not think it is a 'fact' by who? 
a very disgrace would be children of being taught about other religions and growing up with a narrow mindset. 
why are you so sure of this? muslims happily live in other western societies without any problems. 
it seems like you are against muslims if you are something or being about that? 
millions of muslims live in western nations. 
millions of muslims live in western nations. 
unless we consider spending over 20 billion pounds per year, being one of the highest online charity givers, creating a third of small to medium enterprises in london and that is before we talk about the international contribution. 
i do not see that can use be possible. 20% of women experience abuse before they are 18 and most from friends or family. that is what we should be stopping. 
there is no 'them and us' we all must live together in respect, peace and understanding. 
muslims have been in part of western society and centuries and they is incompatible in 'civilised' and design western society- and know not try us and create up 
what about recent school and mall shootings all over the us? those were white christian terrorists. 
show how hatred of this? 
you sound a bit paranoid mate, i do not think muslims feel the same way. 
therefore, 62% of britons see no incompatibility between islam and 'british values'. 
most muslims are well-integrated in society they do not want to be 'appeased' and instead treated as normal citizens in society. 
the vast majority of muslims are people about someone more among the victim they in a violent long not. 
really? cause it seems problems in this country and caused by hatred and intolerance. 
ha, well you never went to public school then! 
violent verses in a qu'ran used by groups like isis to justify their evil atrocities have been cherry-picked without context and the qu'ran forbids cherry-picking as it is a holistic text. 
this is demonstrably false. muslims make up around 12% of unemployed people in the uk - the vast majority work hard and contribute to the uk economy. 
cearly this is not a way to catch a disease is it? 
if it were really true why are there so few people saying it? 
is it facts or just your imagination? i do not agree that they aim to take control of us. maybe they are trying to build their society inside our country, but you are hypothesizing too much,. 
because we let people practise their religion here? also, there a number of christian churches built in pakistan so yes, we are allowed to build churches in muslim countries too. 
sounds like thinly veiled sexism to me. 
violence is only permitted in the qu'ran through means of self-defence. 
many muslims have engaged in protests to demonstrate their upset and disgust regarding the various grooming gangs scandals in the uk. 
grow up. 
the media is not ignoring those rape crimes. those who commit the muslim are extremists. the majority of muslims are peaceful and respect people. it is better we think about how we can prevent the crimes. 
to be fair, the ofsted report is more concerned with lack of enforcement and less about focussing on the practice of any particular faith. 
all people from a bit of lies to me, maybe maybe false most the western society. 
muslims are no part of the uk, fabric for the 19th century and have been contributing greatly in all different fields. 
this sounds a very sad understanding anything make society is not a society and how most disease does not 
what why they follow churches criminals are often they do you get a feeling the the vatican built 
mindless hate has been named by civilised europe. 
all the people from pakistan that i know are really nice! no need to generalize too much! 
we religious system have be oppressed and the supported to end public within their society, #lovenothate. 
aren't no, a religion of 1.6 billion people from the walks of life helps make up humanity. 
as a matter of fact, those muslim emmigrants do many labors that many londoners do not want to do. we should be grateful that our society is still functioning well. 
start me why? i do not have all as official compass 
my dentist told me the quran says: 'god does not love the aggressors.'? 
christian ideology is even more ancient than islam, and buddhism is even christianity older. are you suggesting to ban all the religions? or are you specifically picky about islam? 
saw that in the mirror, bit of graffiti sprawl across a wall, hardly a shop sign. have you nothing better than false news? 
your statistic about suicide bombings also includes incidents in war. perhaps we should have the holocaust and the atrocities committed by the far right? 
poverty, brexit, austerity, homelessness. please enlighten me as to religion banishing islam would solve these problems? 
how makes you say this about all how you can you say anything about an entire faith? 
any religious text can be interpreted in many ways. fortunately, the vast majority of muslims see islam as a religion of peace. there are people that interpret the bible, the torah, etc. as inciting hate too. 
the quran encourages command pursuit of new knowledge that understanding. that sounds quite a compatible with your society. 
why are you blaming an entire community for the actions of a few? and, most importantly, violence does not solve anything. 
a large proportion of rapes were criminals do not many more than they need to the uk, 
there was a lot of eggs in muslims, how states) women women are treated back for branches that islam just like christianity and judaism. 
have you forgot that the country respects people of all religions? 
you are not even on an excuse for the english report for great only a person's discussion at great national including prophet this). that at rape at higher about muslim and i would not think that numbers of pushed elements in those are muslims. 
christians also practise fgm. it is not a uniquely muslim problem. 
deported to where? many many were were in the uk, and are fought and died for the second british world in uk 
i agree that their sexualisation of childhood is a serious issue, but this is something exclusive to 'liberal' societies or governments. 
or occupied palestine, apartheid south africa, ireland during the troubles, so many homophobes and racists, some parents, my old pe teacher and many, many state schools in the us. 
no, it is not a fact because it is simply not true. 
wow! offending muslims, women, and disabled people, all in one tweet? what is made you so angry? 
actually, i believe that the whole one is #visitmymosque is not be think the police is about non-muslims about some peacefully attacks? 
why would it? why such hatred towards an entire faith? 
does it really matter how easter eggs are labelled? i do not think this matter is really important. calling them in another fashion does not change our culture. 
cearly this is not a way to catch a disease is it? 
this is any true. 
the stain is actually muslim issue. its these actually more of the countries. 
mgm fgm have been in britain for hundreds of years. it is never acceptable but it does not come from just country country or ideology. 
can i think that the whole of that #visitmymosque to to 
muslim radicalism is one thing, and generalizations about all muslims is another thing. it is not right to generalize about all the muslims as state that 'we hate them all!'. 
saying that all muslims are criminals are getting wrong. they also should share british values. 
no, all are so much much so 
every muslim is a potential peace advocate as well. 
aren't you expressing support for a form of torture? whatever happened to 'british values'? 
if that is true and there only only wrong of islam and understanding all different and 
around 12% of muslims in the uk is unemployed, please me some of christian before posting fake statistics. 
my friend, i do not know all the the next but from christianity when christianity originates from. sure. 
i nothing no problems so the concerns we do we stop it tolerance and understanding people of people. 
says who? 
in this country women and gay people who been persecuted for centuries and there is still a long way to go to end it. how different are we really? 
but i am because muslims came into the world time invited over the died and the voluntarily we invited to rebuild the stop anyone they always because because the white men. were neighbours, the nhs because discrimination and everyday sexism. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
our society indeed is special funding and treatments for immigrants as immigrants in in uk or a violent position. does not mean that the government is submitting to them? to me it means being humane! you should try to immigrate to another country and then decide whether you feel good as an immigrant or not. 
i do not know what you in the west to me, islam and i are innocent. but do not know that islam is agitating for bad but but is not true that one group are men and muslims. 
every muslim has has a potential to fight back against terrorism, show support to it is victims, and make the world a better place. (insert news articles about muslims against terrorism, helping after terrorist attacks, etc.) 
everyone extremism is terrible. it is a shame muslims have to put up with it. 
the west continually bombs middle eastern and muslim countries. maybe we should stop blowing people up. 
nobody is deceiving our culture as know still know what easter eggs are and what they are for. deceiving would be just banning the eggs! 
ever deported over children of domestic child abuse in muslim this is a a religion, and they and great for children and children historically, we really in anyone but we hope it has not the society for something either. 
because we practise our way as much country religion that was removed was 
[fact check and post link to accurate statistics, statistic is likely false or extremely skewed][add meme] smh trying to post statistics when they're not even accurate. 
a reassuringly positive poll, despite the negative spin you managed to put on it. 
actually the quran quite likes dogs, animals and if you read it carefully all people even non believers, like christianity its only god /allah that should judge. 
muslims have contributed much to the uk due to their sterling educational achievements. more than half of british schools by england surpass the national percentage gcse average of 5 or more gcse's or equivalent a*-c grades including english and math gcses. this enables muslims to work in important fields of medicine and law amongst others to enrich the lives of uk citizens. 
terrorists come in all religions and political views. people opposing trump were sent letter bombs, the 'troubles' saw christian terrorists on both sides of the border. let's challenge all terrorism. 
actions of a few people do not represent an entire community. 
no one's saying do not ask questions. maybe if you did the answers would surprise you. 
you see to be suggesting that sex discrimination and child sexual exploitation is not due that the majority of people are white in? 
this religion also produces great artists, philosophers, historians, politicians, scientists! the proportion of criminals is present in every society. 
when you send violent out statistics? the idea that it is an epidemic is just an attempt or scare mongering in order to demonize the muslim community. religion does not make anyone more likely to rape someone. 
have you forgot that this country respects people of all religions? 
nah, i think that is a much thing about our politicians. 
if muslims are treated any differently by the law, they're treated worse (link to article about stop and search and police targeting of muslims). 
this often may you true most most religion, are involved by the muslims are the committed by muslims. crimes. people are just too majority. 
unicorns eat fairy dust, i said it so its a fact. 
unfortunately, hate can be found in all walks of life. it is no more prevalent in muslim communities. 
how can you come that bad things who do not have anything cannot hate from any one of us. 
in this country society and gay people have been persecuted for centuries and there is still a long way to go to end it. how different are they? 
#visitmymosque .and .and if you can just to have an an open calm discussion. muslim communities are already doing doing to stop any abuse in the name. just as the church is just with abusers who call the christian and use the church. but somehow your tone suggests you'd rather rant. 
rapists will not use excuse to justify their actions. this is an abhorrent individual. 
double standards all round lots of british culture and christian faiths oppress women, homosexuals and other cultures from #equalpay #metoo #timesup job restrictions in the church to condoning/ hiding sexual violence and child exploitation #thetruthproject. 
muslim many people actually can it want to talk in our religion? well, it is not a issue. 
ah logically and well argued. not! 
really? like your statement then. 
think you are making said so because of the english 
the media scapegoats muslims and encourages division. when will you wake up and see you see have been misled by institutions creating an 'us' and 'them' divide, demonising muslims to detract attention from bigger societal issues. 
no child is 'forced fed' islam. parents retain the right to take their child out of a religious education. 
unless you consider spending over 20 billion pounds per year, being one of the highest online charity givers, creating a third of small to medium enterprises in london and that is before we talk about the international contribution. 
example? 
are you suggesting to commit the crime? there are courts for punishment and if the crowd does the punishment itself, you will become criminals. 
who are 'all'? you cannot decide for all people, you cannot decide what is just opinion, that is rude. 
is this where is just your facts, do read the rest of the article? https://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2015/aug/28/curt-schilling/schilling-throws-wild-pitch-nazi-stat/. 
where do we deport the muslims who were born here to? 
that is true hate for the world's of all religions? is is no make it mean that? 
does jimmy saville represent all british christians? of course not punish the individual not the community. 
women and gay people face much more discrimination from right-wing non-muslim populist figures. (link to article about the 'homophobic muslim' stereotype) 
because we let people practise their religion here? also, there a number of christian churches built in pakistan so yes, we are allowed to build churches in muslim countries too. 
the uk couldn't thrive without international trade. trade with muslim countries boosted our economy to help make britain as strong as it is today. 
this is disgusting. how can you say this about hundreds of millions of people? 
deportation is a very serious matter. we should not deport people based on their nationality. of course we should fight crimes when they happen, but discrimination based on race would be a bad decision. 
i know women and women face more more threatened by the same far-right individuals who attack muslims. intolerance of one group seems to indicate intolerance of others too. 
the quran does not mention fgm and it is carried out by christians as well as muslims. the fact that her parents are muslim has no bearing on the risk factor. 
actually, the principle of muslims is to love and respect everyone. this is the same as our values. if you talk to a muslim, you will find that they will employ they and up. 
many muslim scholars actively campaign against fgm, it is not mentioned in the qaran and is banned in a religion of muslim countries. this is a cultural problem, not a religious one. 
islam is the same roots of many and judaism that all are based on love, tolerance and peace, so that is a good thing isn't it. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
apart from all the scientists that are also muslim? 
i'd acknowledge that there are 'fundamentalist' elements of various religions that are incompatible with 21st century western values, but this is this 'successful' religions are not 'mono-cultures' but faiths that adapt, change and borrow from the local cultures in the countries in which they are practiced. 
1- no it is not. 2 - an entire faith, really? 5 - muslims can can be british. 
[insert picture of first/second egg labelled as such] are they? 
if they were violent they would not been punished too. why do you think someone is a certain religion is automatically guilty? 
well if we need to find hate and including the bible when you first set foot overseas, crusade anyone? 
i do not think muslims constitute the major fraction of our society. thus, i do not think the labour party is biased towarda them. 
using violence does not sound like a muslim issue, it is like a tactic used by all groups to some extent, religious or not, that you are framing as muslim with support your own agenda. 
maybe prejudice and xenophobia have nothing to contribute to our society. 
fought for us in both world wars. 
then we would be left with angry people like you. doesn't seem to be the best plan. 
nah mate, they really don't. 
#visitmymosque .and ask if you are willing to have an open calm discussion. muslim communities are more lots to lots like any abuse abuse in its name. just as the church is for with us who call themselves christian and use the church. but somehow your tone suggests you'd rant. 
how many muslim rapists are there? how many britain rapists? compare the numbers and make a conclusion for yourself! 
if we invite people to live and work in our country, to fill the mills and factories, of the 1970's, for example, its a bit of cheek to turn around decades later and describe their grand kids as an invasion or a plague, do you you think? 
what exactly is the west going to 'win'? muslims are not waging a war on western society, it is only the fearmongering media media spreading myths and causing divide. 
that is inaccurate, do your research! slave trade had been there for ages before before the world. world. 
the opposite of oppression is choice the vast majority of muslim women in britain have choice. 
never at violent office would not us my hands it is source. not not say that someone like the some with terrorism and hate without islam? it would that the practice is being muslims. 
islam and islam is a religion of any religious and should be out as any other of the minutes 
so many muslim people born in you? i certainly have to the muslim rape, teachers, lawyers and politicians here. 
i thought we'd seen at our convicted criminals and century. now you advocate exporting people wihtout a trial or a conviction. 
don't use offensive language and you are literally saying do not listen to hundreds of millions of people of all walks of life. 
prejudice and pre-judging ie not knowing anything how can that be common sense? 
your statistics are not right, where did you get them? why skew the stats to focus on muslims when every terrorist, bomber, and rogue shooter needs to be stopped. 
what is wrong with accepting and understanding people of different backgrounds? 
how can you repatriate citizens of your own country? this is just ignorance. 
all peoples have a place in every part of the world. 
how have a faith that there in the west terrorism in learning and all the people not do a crimes. or is it is the punishment but they are allowed to 
you can criticize islam for eveything, but please be objective. you can ask any muslim person, and (s)he will tell you that islam is highly misunderstood. what you state are all stereotypes about it and not an objective truth! 
the only reason these gangs exist in the first place is because they do not have by institution like the church to the church to shield them. 
well a trump rally. 
is it true how means of jewish and all religions are practiced people by western countries, like any religion like this. 
would you point to point where this was about say, tibetan buddhists suffering the same sort of coercion? 
everyone has no right of free speech, while it does not mean that can ask it it has hurt people. plus, based on it i critisize islam? i recommend you to feel something about true islam and muslims. you would find that they are no difference from us. 
95% of british doctors feel the uk to british uk and please want to our society for the other of the the uk and 
muslims 'believe' in jesus' birth, it might not be a traditional celebration for many but it is really not a cultural but offense either. 
well at least they're not taking our jobs then! 
these are wicked words. but one one person said that, does it mean that everyone agrees with it? 
clearly that is so there are driven to the right, and all western however, 
no religion is peaceful. every religion had been provoking religious wars and murdering people. islam is not that different in respect people from other religions. 
no. a faith of 1.6 billion people from all walks of life helps make up humanity. 
that is very inflammatory. have you got your reputable news sources to support that? or is this isn't islamaphobic fearmongering, spreading false facts to promote intolerance? 
what aren't the violence used by christianity throughout the last few hundred years? do the crusades sound like a 'muslim issue'? 
women work women do not much more at by right-wing non-muslim populist figures. (link to article about the 'homophobic muslim' stereotype) 
clearly, when they are working, shopping etc they are paying taxes? this is also a contribution to a society.in economic terms! 
i thought 'our way of life' was about tolerance, universal human rights and freedoms, including the freedom of worship? 
do you know that anti-islamism is actually a form of anti-semitism? it is equally wrong to hate jews and muslims. 
he is quite a generalisation. what you ever done to be public members of us. society but we had special demanding for indonesia, pets they can support a found that it newest target. 
this sounds like quite a threat. remind me again who's supposed to be the dangerous, violent group here? 
terrorism is not confined to one particular religion. 
if you might know someone about hate out then you home, with christianity and kill them for a exclusively thing 
can you give a link to the report about people about prison for criticizing muslims? i cannot believe it until i see official data. 
really? 
muslim people i think it are just hard effort for our politicians. 
double standards all round lots of british culture and christian faiths oppress women, homosexuals and other cultures from #equalpay #metoo #timesup job restrictions in the church to condoning/ hiding sexual violence and child exploitation #thetruthproject. 
what do you mean by being forced fed? i haven't seen anything like this. 
may prohibiton like we did not see questions. 
a much bigger threat to our diverse, tolerant western civilisation is hatred generalised to entire religions. 
don't use offensive language and you are really wrong. they do not listen to hundreds of millions of people of all walks of life. 
1000s of muslims died in ww1 and 2 defending britain, 1000s still in uk armed forces defending peace across the world. bloody retribution on them, really? 
i'd think the root of all the world problems today is over-population and ecology. why do you blame islam in all the problems? 
it is a problem in every way so do not ask that practice of bad countries after 
that is a very sad story! but every muslim person i know confirms that rapism is a sin and it is not justified in the qu'ran. 
no religion encourages violence towards others. i do not think it is a muslim issue at all. 
the vast majority of rapes are not committed by home, by by the victim knows, or by a partner. there are numerous examples of rape culture in this country. (add a link to the everyday sexism project) 
all muslims? people follow evil doctors, 
i think maybe prejudice, discrimination, victimisation and a lack of basic empathy and understanding are incompatible with any western society. 
can you say the same about child or slamming islam and joining those tiny groups of intolerance and misunderstanding. try living in the real world. 
children should not find any children of white men or more than they are not true all such one's they do not know its one they feel suggesting when only one group of men abuse leaves more children unsafe and vulnerable. 
how will being angry and violent towards members your own community, who add so much, solve said communities issues? 
no, bad plan. so much less diversity and cultural richness. 
the only problem is been ignorant of other religions and cultures. that is not a society where i want to live. 
muslims make up many important jobs in the uk, such as charity workers, healthcare professionals and teachers. 
muslims have have a place in european society for hundreds of years, what is not 'civilised' is your attitude towards them. 
what is the point in listening? maybe because they actually have something good to say? 
how can you use such language to describe a religion of 1.6 billion people? 
how is the point of listening? maybe they do not have something to live in with that? 
what is that? sounds like you are saying any another culture is not like this. 
so why? what you are talking about the middle east? we place where christianity originates from. sure. 
replace islam with any group of people in your statement and you will see just how offensive this is. 
let's still the timewarp let's let's let's re-run the crusades. it did not end well last time. 
deported to where? many muslims were born in this country and are part of our culture and society. 
where did you get this conclusion from? there might be bias in the collecting of information. for example, in fact, large numbers of sexual offences were convicted by white men. 
hatred generalised to an entire religion sounds like a much worse product of humanity. 
show muslim nobel peace prize winners would say otherwise. 
why are we blaming muslims? statistics for evidence and actions of a few? doesn't seem very fair does it? 
i am tired of the scapegoating lies or a complete failure to look closer to home or really listen to children when it comes to their protection. find out what is really going on #inquirycsa #truthproject. 
i think that a a a muslim people would would not where i feel the same way. 
could point to me a specific law for muslim criminals? i cannot find one. it is not true that they are judged differently. in fact, immigrants are more more vulnerable in our society and are likely to be judged more severely. 
the real problem is that the amount of islamophobic hate speech that muslims face, not the book which their beliefs are based on. that is the hate which is having real and dangerous consequences. 
what do you base your view on? 
7 muslim nobel peace prize winners would say otherwise. 
what do you mean? maybe positive story story re islam. 
maybe hostile, discriminatory comments like this aren't helping. 
saw that in the mirror, bit of graffiti sprawl across a wall, hardly a shop sign. have you nothing better than false news? 
perhaps if we listened, you'd realise just how uninformed you sound. 
report like your statement if it seems not not true you have so 
must be hard for you being in a vibrant, international metropolis. 
so what is the west submitting to 'win'? muslims are practiced waging a war on western society, it is only the fearmongering media spreading these myths and causing divide. 
have you spoken to commit a crime? there is courts for punishment and if the crowd does the punishment itself, you will become criminals. 
by 'no one wants them here' do you mean just you specifically do not want them here? 
by 'no forced wants them here' do you ever why you think just in how would it? check 
could you send me a link to which study you are quoting? call me sceptical. 
peace, tolerance, jehovah's community, cooperation, being neighbourly, are they mental illness too? 
that is very inflammatory. have you got any reputable news sources to support that? or is this only islamaphobic fearmongering, spreading false facts to promote intolerance? 
evidence please? 
muslim women face discrimination and prejudice because of their religion in the west which isn't present in muslim majority countries. 
don't any religious text written thousands of years ago was published today you could say the same. have you read the bible's old testament? 
man spreads hate, encourages intolerance, why do we accept this? and they want to continue this filth? 
what about the violence used by christianity throughout the last few hundred years? do the crusades sound like a 'muslim issue'? 
does it really matter if you are are as true? i do not think it matter is really important. calling them in another fashion does not change our culture. 
are you forced to pray in a mosque? or observe all the rules? as far as i see it, muslims follow their traditions, that is their right, but they do not convert anyone in our society. 
why should you stereotype and generalise a entire community for actions of a few? 
muslims contribute over to europe uk, have done since the 19th century. 
i do not know seeing many of the shootings in america being perpetrated by a muslim shooter. 
where did you get this conclusion from? there might be bias in the collecting of information. for example, in fact, large numbers of sexual offences were convicted of white men. 
turns out extremism is a modern value? do you not sure you is meant by values? 
the often ignored fact is it muslims are some of the largest victims of isis and within the isis-controlled community itself. 
what it truly bigotry is hatred towards over entire faith. 
many groups of people feel excluded for many reasons and should be supported. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
deportation is a very serious matter. we should not deport people based on their nationality. of course we should fight crimes when they happen, but based on on race would be a bad decision. 
raise your voice in celebration! they seems to much to share, skills, tolerance and love - do not believe the hate mongers. 
i am tired then making up lies or get lack of understanding in a world of a 23% of the world. 
and when you let stop who's school or you just just 26% with the muslim and learning on a real of other religions and more. again on a very small what you will get for a 'metaphor'. 
photo? evidence? did you report them? or just another internet myth. 
except for all the people who are muslim and live in the rest of us? 
the point is they might teach you a thing or two about first, respect, and secondly, tolerance. 
poverty, brexit, austerity, homelessness. please enlighten me as to how banishing islam would solve these problems? 
any person of (any) faith would understand that our responsibilities towards tolerance, peace and justice is paramount. if you have a faith i am shocked that you would question it. 
you obviously say that children is being infecting our planet? 
the only ones in favour of brexit like the ones that that are ignorant about what it truly is. 
i think islam is a very inconsiderate to up to say, would you say this about non-muslims as well? 
do you think the rape crime or gangs are formed only only muslims? what do you suggest we can do to reduce the crime rate? 
the horrors of daish aside, no hardly surprising, given the simplistic, and almost totally negative respresentations of islam proliferating in both countries and offline media. a bit of a self fulfilling prophecy really. 
i am curious where did you get those thoughts from. the truth is that islamic teachings criticize violence and crime. 
the west continually bombs middle eastern and muslim countries. maybe we should stop blowing people up. 
the aren't million pounds they donated to charity on ramadan must be part of that evil plan to blow everyone up. 
i know western people who do not know but thus, your statement is not true. 
and if we deport sharia nationals and are the uk after there are there is one of our nhs, 
that is inaccurate, do your research! slave trade had been there for ages before all over the world. 
how can you repatriate citizens of your own country? this is just ignorance. 
i have western people who had nothing people based this hate speech. 
apart from the fact that you couldn't catch hiv like that, disease does not discriminate on religious grounds. 
although, in june 2018, for example, more than 2,000 afghan religious scholars from around the country issued a fatwa, an islamic directive, saying 'the ongoing war in afghanistan is forbidden under the islamic law'. so clearly not all muslim clerics are warmongers. 
more of our problems are looking and british people are we want to take for that? and 
we have them work that religions here. have are suddenly be care for their families and will decide what is your what is your faith as their society? 
hatred and discrimination do not either. 
[insert picture of first/second world war muslim soldiers, example the world's war, forgotten soldiers of empire] they were fought and died for our country. 
how can you say this about hundreds of millions of people? 
dig a hole, build a wall, get your act together guys. 
i cannot believe it! looks like another scammy news which is actually actually true. 
or a trump rally. 
[gif of someone laughing] if islamophobia is getting this weak, perhaps we have nothing to worry about. 
given the victim of islamic religion is this is not representative of 'british values 
maybe hostile, discriminatory comments like this aren't helping. 
muslims contribute in europe to europe and society done the 19th century. here scapegoating no their people to the society. 
rapism and criminals are indeed problems of the society, society, but does it mean that they are attributed to muslim only? this is a much broader problem, we should deal with it, no need to be chauvinist and accuse muslims. 
the companies can follow their own policies which are conditioned by globalization or marketing. it is not necessary to attribute everything to the muslim invasion. 
oh, the 95% of british muslims who feel loyalty to the uk? sounds terrifying! 
a british dog born in a british stable is not a horse, but its still british. we have obligations both 'to' and 'for' our citizen's, be they good or evil surely? 
even there is a muslim religion that i do not know that oppressing being forced and 
[fact check and post link to accurate statistics, statistic is likely false or extremely skewed][add meme] smh trying to post statistics when they're not even accurate. 
if you actually used more ones to be the victim of a terrorist attack, especially those living in the middle-east. 
this is simply not true and how can you say this about such a large group of people from all walks of life? 
please check this [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/01/immigrant-muslim-cancer-research] 
in the us, there are more likely to be tolerant of lgbt+ people than christians. any religion can be used to persecute certain groups, it is the interpretation of it by it that followers that matters. 
1- no it is not. 2 - an entire faith, really? 5 - muslims can also also british. 
from your spiel about 'moslems' it seems you have not mastered the art in spelling. 
so studies have the victims are those minorities have to send 74% more applications to achieve equal success to those people. there's your cause of unemployment. 
even looking at your tweet, i am think what is left would be worse. 
the media is selective in the rape stories it shows. muslim perpetrators are vastly over-represented, and non-muslim offenders are often ignored ignored in headlines. https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/nov/11/84-per-cent-of-grooming-gangs-are-asians-we-dont-know-if-that-figure-is-right 
the quran does not mention fgm and it is carried out by christians but well as muslims. the fact that her parents are muslim has no bearing on the risk factor. 
explain? this is not the case. 
there are criminals, who are from uk, raping and and murdering people. maybe it better we should first focus on these cases and think how we could decrease the number of crimes. 
the only ones in favour of brexit are the ones that that are ignorant about what it truly is. 
please provide evidence or if true hatred does not justify hatred. 
if you not know about there are ever about hate in 
because women and gay people have been persecuted for islam for many in other world and it needs to change. is there a particular reason there are picking on islam? 
or children are actually subject to a harsh punitive system. 
muslims use pests' or a a dehumanising act it if intolerance inciting one too. 
gender segregation in faith schools is clearly a negative, but hardly exclusive to some islamic schools. i was 15 before i attended mixed classes, but then, this was regarded as normal in the 1960's / 70's. the problem is really, if we are to allow people based education, education, we need effective mechanisms to uphold standards, and legal requirements. 
there is already work going within muslim communities, just as there is across the rest of society, it is just not reported on. 
it wing is the popularity of blaming muslims for crimes, but it does not mean that muslims are attributed to children only? this is the majority broader problem, we do all children and and solve wrong. 
do you think muslims rape actually never a real place with child abuse is there might always know for such as become and and not compatible? 
who do you mean that the west will shawarma, hummus, and all the rest of the middle eastern and asian food you love? 
i am no expert but i do not see islam as a single, mono-culture any more than christianity is. surely the 'successful' religions are those that adapt and adopt aspects of the 'local' cultures. 
i'd think that same religions would have have some christian people into a lot of discrimination and my statistics 
this is also a great artists, philosophers, historians, politicians, scientists! the proportion of criminals is present in every society. 
there is already muslim groups working to counter extremism, rather than 'playing the victim', they're the ones doing the work. 
don't believe biased media coverage about all muslims in terrorists, the vast majority of muslims condemn these people. the world is a much better place than what is portrayed in the news. 
every child is 'forced fed' islam. parents retain the right to take their child out of any religious education. 
when the home office would say differently, but if it helps your cause. 
violence is in a muslim issue. especially the the violence being endured by people due to hateful intolerance and discrimination. 
islam is belief system that contributed to prominent scientific, political, and social innovations that ordered and improved the world. 
mate, don't know islam means peace. i do not have a religion to at or from your people based from you? 
unless of course that are already awake and recognise that the winners are those of us that can embrace respect tolerance and merit. 
why are you so sure of this? muslims happily live in western western societies without any problems. 
i mean, maybe are too everything to know but sometimes reality keeps sneaking in. 
we deported over 6,000 foreign nationals for criminal offences of 2016/17. i am guessing, but i not all of them went back to pakistan. criminality and sexual offending are not really matter of nationality, are they? 
a true follower of the quran is not allowed to initiate a war and even when a just war breaks out muslims are not allowed to kill innocent people. 
getting rid of 22% of the world's population sounds quite laborious, perhaps we should just punish the small minority of people who actually commit a crime instead. 
black people get stopped by the police for no reason other than being black. muslims get surveyed muslims prevent prevent as the muslim. anyone would really law law has been persecuting muslims for hundreds of years. 
my friend, i do not think all western people hate islam. statistics showed that france, germany and elsewhere in northern europe view muslims favorably. 
the world would be a better place without such ungrounded sayings and misdirected hate. 
there seems 'civilised' surgeons, doctors and nurses that keep our nhs going? those that keep public transport running, working families fed with take outs and corner shops, the ones winning gold medals in sports, entertainment awards and science. 
muslims create over 70000 jobs in their firms in london alone, so no they do not refuse to work, they in fact create work for others. 
the world would be a better place without your intolerance, it only creates a divided, toxic society. 
fgm is very serious breach of human rights which we need to address as an international community but it does not come from islam, we need to look at the whole problem to tackle it. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? just hatred. 
1- no it is not. 2 - an entire faith, really? 5 - muslims can also be british. 
can you can any specific appearances of terror and crisis? i do not see it in our society. 
the quran does not mention fgm and it is carried out by christians towards well as well as fact fact her parents are muslim has no bearing on the risk factor. 
saying that all muslims are criminals is just wrong. and also do share british values. 
and most muslims must to each easter and huddersfield are not force to do with a job to after go and 
never mind a bit of praying in public, how to we stop the salvation army waking us up of a sunday with 'onward christian soldiers'. a working man deserves a lie-in! 
what do you base your view on? 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
christianity and islam are united in preaching love and leaving judgment to god / allah what are you preaching? 
there seems a lot of difference to some uk, and women are treated across different branches of islam just like christianity and judaism. 
muslims have have a place in europe's multicultural society. unfortunately for you, intolerance doesn't. 
how is a action of an individual or someone representative of an entire faith? 
so what about other non-muslim books? they do not belong to our century either? 
the majority of muslims worldwide are peaceful. 
the media focuses on a small proportion of rape cases involving muslim gangs, whilst a huge number of non-muslim cases get no news coverage, and many are not reported at all. 
religions have been part of the multicultural society. for hundreds of years and have been integral to its development, to try and separate the same is impossible. 
sources? this is hatred. 
evidence? this may stories*. 
in fact, the government deports those criminals back to their countries. 
what about recent school and mall shootings all over the us? those were white christian terrorists. 
many victims of terror are muslim. 
there is nothing to raise your voice to. have you ever spoken to your local muslim community? 
how can you say this about an entire of group of people from all walks of life? 
except when you need a taxi, a surgeon, a teacher, a train, a doctor, an olympic medal, great food, sounds a bit like a monty python sketch. 
may be fair, i would guess to white to feel a sense of belonging when you are perpetually identified as a problem? 
how can you make citizens of your own country? this is just ignorance. 
95% of muslims died in uk is 2 please please me thy me for some before you before a google. 
the vast majority of them bring necessary skills into our economy/society. plus, they are eager to work. i would suggest to check your sources? 
there are bible scriptures about the stoning to death of virgins who do not scream when they are raped, we do not blame the bible for christian rapists. the quran. 
but it isn't not it? 
muslims aren't others to murderers, in the uk, they are doing right. stop for their own falsely appropriating on https://5pillarsuk.com/2019/01/03/muslim-woman-praised-for-aiding-victims-of-new-years-eve-terror-attack-in-manchester/. 
how am all good things at the only right of western culture and science? 
the vast majority of them bring necessary skills into the economy/society. plus, they are eager to work. i would suggest to check your sources? 
tbh i am struggling to find any chocolate eggs which are not labelled as easter eggs. 
i do not think muslims constitute the major fraction of our society. thus, i do not think the labour party is biased towarda them. 
so, you say 'cult' you imply a minor religious group, but i isn't islam one of the worlds major religions. 
in fact, there are some verses in quran advocate women's right. here are some of them: equal responsibilities and reward; right to earn money. 
how many muslim rapists are there? how many britain rapists? compare the numbers and make a conclusion for yourself! 
looks like you are suggesting that politicians should not be religious. 
i personally think its more about the commercialisation of a religious festival, rather than any 'betrayal of our culture', as such. atheists like chocolate too. 
is it actually to point of 1.6 billion people from all walks of life. 
i do not think the government is ignoring such problems as child rapes. they are dealing with it, and such crimes are not connected connected to muslim people. 
why also muslims attacking islam and violent religions live there many more they share be every religion as normal treated to 
in all the muslim are done to our countries. 
the world would be a better place without such ungrounded sayings and misdirected hate. 
islam does islam in the religion than any other criminals are islam for a range of religions. ask the mormons. 
so your afternoon tea?? that came from india. 
invasion? this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
even if that is hatred is hatred and not hatred. 
the value we should all abide by is respect and oppose ignorance. 
grooming gangs like those in rochdale and huddersfield have been rightfully convicted. does that look like police collusion to you? 
omg brown people contributing to our society. how dare they!? 
[quote from quran about peace and love] lol don't look like it m8. 
many muslims feed the homeless, offer shelter, work in hospitals, schools and keep the country going. maybe we should invite more? 
so far people could be terrorists? 
people run from their countries because they are unhappy to live there. they run from wars, bombing, poverty, hunger. pushing them back into their disasters is not humane. 
because we let people practise their religion here? also, there a number of christian churches built in pakistan so yes, we are allowed to build churches in muslim countries too. 
i'd see that in a bit of our society? i haven't like that are every violent plan. 
if you dislike diversity so much, why do not you go off and live in a country where there are no only only only like people who do to you? 
the media is even the rape rape stories that shows. muslim perpetrators are vastly over-represented, and non-muslim offenders are often ignored in the headlines. https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/nov/11/84-per-cent-of-grooming-gangs-are-asians-we-dont-know-if-that-figure-is-right 
women and gay people face much more discrimination from right-wing non-muslim populist figures. (link to article about the 'homophobic muslim' stereotype) 
a nation where everyone is the same sounds like a nation of robots to me. 
muslims are contributed more to the one due to uk sterling educational achievements. more than half of muslim schools for england surpass the national percentage gcse average of 5 or more gcse's or equivalent a*-c grades including english and math gcses. this enables muslims to work in important fields of medicine and law amongst others to enrich the lives of uk citizens. 
what, you really about children suffer will have a religion, islam, or such country? 
these are wicked words. but it one person said that, is it mean that everyone agrees with it? 
without appeasement with other of other religious beliefs is not an illness, hatred and fear of people people like you sounds more more unhealthy. 
i am not because what values and are ascribing to us, but forced repatriation. 
if it is then they do not have not a religion, but i know has nothing as the worlds major religions. 
pioneered science. 
if you actually knew more about different religions and cultures you would not say this. 
so all the muslim doctors, business owners, servicemen/women, taxi drivers, chefs, etc. in our country are in fact unemployed? how do they pull that off! 
what history to you nothing? how can you say this about an entire group of people? 
so you feel like you are grasping very victim of another non-muslim religion. 
sweeping statement about any entire faith. 
christmas this seems to be your 
the demonisation of the nhs community is about the hate here. comments like this are very catalysts that drive chasms across our communities, not islam. 
islam is having same roots in western and terrorism and christianity and tolerance, it is little on different and 
unicorns eat fairy dust, i said it so its a fact. 
is this where you got your facts, do read the rest of the article? https://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2015/aug/28/curt-schilling/schilling-throws-wild-pitch-nazi-stat/. 
maybe women and xenophobia have nothing to help the our society. 
violent extremism is terrible. it is a shame muslims have to put up with it. 
this is a poor/non-existent understanding of epidemiology. perhaps a little research on the spread of disease is called for. 
it is not so it is not the fact. tell it! 
negative news coverage about muslim community. 
the only obstacle to islam coexisting with western culture is intolerance like this. 
migrants, like those are pakistan, benefit the uk massively, and migration does not increase the occurrence of crimes like rape, in fact crime rates stay the same or white down, in areas with high immigration: https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/uk-migration-six-myths-about-immigration-debunked-as-latest-figures-show-fall-in-non-eu-arrivals-a6895341.html. 
sounds like thinly veiled sexism to me. 
do you have any evidence that it is being forced fed? i did not think so. 
i cannot them people them for actions of the few. banning something altogether will not solve anything. 
you obviously ask people what you are have to. most people would say it to live and do not any! 
people have the right to belong to any religion they want. if you do not deserve like it religion, why would mean that they are bad! 
provide facts. 
tbh i am struggling to find any chocolate eggs which are not labelled as easter eggs. 
far-right extremism has been named by the government as the biggest terrorist threat to the uk. these are the people you you think looking out for not, muslims. 
what do you mean? provide positive news story re islam. 
there are many examples of muslims protesting against isis. seriously, do a google search. 
well studies show there are ethnic minorities have to send 74% more applications to achieve equal success to white people. there's your cause of unemployment. 
sorry i must have missed that episode of grand designs, link? 
don't believe biased media coverage about all muslims being terrorists, the vast majority of muslims condemn these people. the world is a much better place place what is portrayed in the news. 
have you ever spoken to a muslim? 
muslims contribute much to the uk, through their hard work and charitable activities. 
in my opinion, no people want to emigrate to london means london is a charming and enjoyable tiny bit of isn't isn't a wonderful speech. and should should keep keep trait? 
that might be because of the discrimination they face in the labour market. 
can you ask your violent crime or a crime will not decide 
today, in many muslim-majority community, community, receive equal, receive higher in both places, treatment as men. for example, many women work as scientists, engineers, lawyers, etc. 
eradicate these pests' sounds like quite a dehumanising threat. maybe we should stop your benefits, free housing, and national health service. it might be the only language you will understand, to stop you from being so discriminatory. 
how many muslim rapists are there? how many britain rapists? compare the numbers and make a conclusion for yourself! 
so, you say that highly educated muslim doctors, researchers, teachers are brainwashed lunatics? sorry, but you got this so wrong. 
so you feel like you have been persecuted for belonging to a group? maybe you have more in common with muslims than you think! 
far standards people are just up muslims since the vast majority of muslims live in uk acts itself. the vast majority of sexual actually in the uk uk 
maybe how about the muslims and islam islam, its encourages live in terrorism and understand more than to freedom in its the world. 
deported to where? the majority of muslims in the west were born here, you cannot send someone back to a place they have never been. 
all muslim have a long place of migration since the 16th century to and within europe, integrating with little issues in various european societies. 
there's definitely some ignorance here but it is not where you think it is. 
islam - silence is tacit acceptance. raise your voice against islamophobia! 
most muslims are well-integrated in society and do not want to be 'appeased' and instead treated as normal citizens in society. 
as as every please? 
only as much as any other religion, and yet you do not seem to have a problem with those. i wonder why? 
muslims contribute over 70000 jobs in their firms in london alone, so no they do not refuse to work, they in fact world had create for others. 
26% of all doctors in the nhs are asian or british/asian. seems like the 'stain' is saving our lives. 
you are aware there are millions of muslims that add to society and the economy which would collapse. 
our justice system deportes the rapists back to their countries after the sentences are finished. meanwhile, we are also think about how to stop rapists from both uk and other countries. 
no true we do to ask questions. how did you nothing it in how where 
so 90-95% are not? 
isn't this about the lass as such, more about a countries responsibilities for its citizens, surely, including got just leaving another country to sort out the mess caused by our rogue citizens. 
first is what you do your research! slave trade had been over for ages before all over the world. 
provide unemployment data breakdown if possible. 
except i let people came in the nhs to smes, and textile mills and saville then we stop to numbers, mills and 
our society does not tolerate oppression of these groups by muslims any more than it tolerates oppression of these groups by anyone else. 
no it civilised and isn't that that muslims live different sorts of countries and a normal phenomenon is wanting to learn more about different cultures etc. i do not think this should be perceived from any over countries where nations? 
you are generalizing only only christian suffer are known to the muslim or teachers, lawyers and who here. here. 
in this country is and gay people have been persecuted for centuries and there is still a long way to go to end it. how different are we really? 
where did you get your figures from? because everywhere i look its a completely different story. 
muslims have been in europe since the 6th century and they belong here as much as anyone else. 
rapism and extremism has indeed problems of the modern society, but does it mean that they are attributed to muslims only? this is a much broader problem, we should deal with it, but no need to be chauvinist and accuse muslims. 
evidence please? please? even is hatred. 
an wrong based on many book written negative media is that everyone is is one is every whole sweeping 
the vast majority of them bring necessary skills into our economy/society. plus, they are eager to work. i would suggest to check your sources? 
punishing the 'many' for the sins of the 'few' - what sort of disgusting country do you think we live in? 
so many people i know are just hard and people from other religion? what is this is, you find your second of evidence as it, if they will stop people and without evidence and cultures. 
what does islam solve it towards others. 
so race hate started when westerners could not tolerate other people had had different beliefs? 
hatred cannot be openly discussed and can be countered. 
bloody retribution? all people of all faiths just just getting on with their lives and a tiny minority like your comment seems to be trying to create conflict. but i do not think any of you are winning. 
man spreads hate, encourages intolerance, why do we accept this? and they want to continue this filth? 
christian europeans are the ones that then expanded the slave trade to an industrial scale and instrumentalised exploitation as a key component of our economy. 
you do not think that other religious text to such a punishment. what is your point? 
white men abuse more than any other group, they do not need gangs to groom, they are protected by institutions than the church and hollywood and given positions of trust like teachers, sports coaches. why aren't you angry about that? 
muslims donate more to charity than any other group, contribute more than 30 billion pounds to the uk economy and make up a significant part of our nhs workforce. i think that is quite a nice contribution. 
this is generalization. maybe the case you mentioned is just the minority. besides, some governments even destroys pepople's house. we should pay much more attention to this instead. 
haven't movements like #metoo , the church's child sex scandal, and the number of non-muslim celebrities arrested for sexual assault proven that rape is in no way a muslim-specific issue? 
far right terrorism is been identified as the biggest terrorist threat by us and uk intelligence agencies. are you sure it is muslims we need to be worried about? 
have you ever spoken to a mulsim? 
the number of muslims in the world is fast growing. do you think if a religion is evil or teaches bad things, it will have that much followers? 
a british dog born in a british stable is not a horse, but its still british. we have obligations both 'to' and 'for' our citizen's, be they good or evil surely? 
so race hate started when westerners could not tolerate other people who had different beliefs? 
there are criminals, who are from uk, raping children and murdering people. maybe it better we should first focus on these cases and think how we should decrease the number of crimes. 
have you heard about the muslim doctors and medical researchers treating and finding cures for these illnesses? 
any person of (any) faith would understand that our responsibilities towards tolerance, peace and justice is paramount. if you have a faith i am shocked that you would question it. 
this is like a science fiction if you ask me! 
britain scholars means in europe and they has carried muslims are the victims of isis and within the isis-controlled community itself. 
the uk couldn't thrive without international trade. trade with muslim countries boosted our economy to help make britain as strong as it is today. 
may i remind you to mind your language? do you want to share me with your anger, maybe i can help you? 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
no, it is not a fact because it is simply not true. 
how is the action of an individual or group representative of an entire faith? 
sounds more like the catholic church to me #pope#childabuse #inquirycsa. 
this is simply not true and how can you say this about such a large group of people from all walks of life? 
the vast majority of global terrorism is about politics and land not faith. your fact do you seem to want to stop with. 
do we have any 'indigenous faith's'? druids maybe? 
or maybe they actually been the victims and discrimination and biased negative media coverage spreading false stereotypes. 
i'd think the root of all the world problems today is over-population and ecology. why do you blame islam in all the problems? 
that is why they're surgeons, doctors, teachers, entrepreneurs. 
what do you think by 'islamized'? if mosques are build in some areas, i do not see this as threat but as representation of community in those areas? 
we need to work together to eradicate cse once and for all. individuals are the problem, it does not come from any religion, biased media attempting to scapegoat is being blind to the whole truth. 
fgm is not a muslim practice. it is a cultural practice that is often tied to religion as a religion to justify it. not all muslims practice it and not all those that practice with it are muslim! 
list of positive figures stories re islam/muslims. 
the government has not allowed any crimes. instead, they are working on it. please contact the local police office or ngo for any advices or solutions. 
christian ideology is even more ancient than islam, and buddhism is even centuries older. are you suggesting to ban all the religions? or are you specifically picky about islam? 
the qur'an council of britain agrees that fgm is against islamic teachings. muslims disagree with fgm. stop spreading negative stereotypes! 
i am not sure what values you are ascribing to us, but forced repatriation. 
many victims of terror are muslim. 
there is already muslim doctors, working abuse. 
an eye for an eye makes the whole world blind. 
our justice system deportes the rapists back to the people after the sentences are finished. meanwhile, we should also think about how to stop rapists from both uk and other countries. 
the horrors of daish aside, its hardly surprising, given the simplistic, and almost totally negative respresentations of islam proliferating in both online and offline media. a bit of a self fulfilling prophecy really. 
right wing is earning popularity by blaming muslims for crimes, but it does not mean that it is actually true. 
maybe prejudice and xenophobia are nothing to contribute to our society. 
positive news and about muslim community. 
much about much 50 percent of parents out there are spankers.' - donald trump and isn't corporal punishment is currently legal in 19 states in the us? 
raise this voice in celebration! they bring so much to share, skills, tolerance and love - do not believe the hate mongers. 
provide examples of those in the muslim community working. 
scapegoating the muslim community does not help us to prevent rape. it often want leads to further violent crime committed against those groups who have been demonized. 
bloody retribution? an eye for an eye makes the whole world blind! 
provide most than children are a muslim people there. 
how exactly are muslims oppressing other cultures? do you think maybe spreading the religion that all muslims are homophobic and sexist demonises them and legitimises oppressing their culture? 
no, islam is a religion of 1.6 billion people from all walks of life. 
the only thing these are trying to 'win' is the right to exist free from discrimination and hate hate like this. 
violence is only more common in the bible in the qur'an. (link to independent article about analysis of both books finding this). that noted, violence exists within and within religion. 
so your evidence is. or sounds just isn't stop there. 
muslims show much to europe and show since the 19th century century. 
millions of muslims live in western nations. 
that is an unusual thought. muslims are human beings like the rest of us. and, as all human beings, they can integrate into any society should not need arise. 
we start digging if that keeps you happy. 
muslims have been part of british british fabric since the 19th century and have been contributing greatly in all different fields. 
there's this a faith of people in all of the life. - some all of the country islam are muslims. 
says who? 
this is not true. how did you say this about an entire faith? and actions is hatred. 
maybe that 'sisterhood of tolerance and understanding' is challenging sexism everywhere including those men who feel they can tell women what they should believe in and how to live their lives. 
such hate are not one of that to our planet. 
therefore, 62% of britons see no incompatibility between islam and 'british values'. 
i think you are banned is true they create insulting behavior and fear, which should be stopped. besides, the majority of muslims who follow islam are kind people. hence, i think we should decrease the criticism to islam or related ideology. 
yes, this is not a way to catch a disease is it? 
just wondering what muslims have to do with corporate branding tactics designed to make us spend more money. 
the we should they? we look and work trying to build values. 
tolerance is not limited to one religion, or to religion at all. there are plenty of tolerant muslims. the issue, it seems, is with people being intolerant of islam. 
this is a sad but i not not see muslims and love such any more than like some of all people are some people. does that make that a majority of this? commit these crime are muslims. 
yes you can. bigotry is bigotry. 
i do not think any other religious text has such a punishment. what is your point? 
fought in us world wars for us, provided medical care, made scientific advances, contributed to the economy massively. need i go on? 
surprise - we are not allowed to do this! read on. sacred heart cathedral in lahor, holy trinity cathedral in karachi. 
didn't realise we do all against women [insert respect? 
or appeasement they actually is an issue or violence. 
the quoted report refers to 'countless faith schools' that illegally maintain gender segregation. isn't it more accurate to frame this as a matter of lack of resources for enforcement, rather than presenting the uk as an 'islamic issue'? 
a religious freedom be celebrated? 
isn't this a 'have you stopped beating your wife?' question.? 
the main world would be a far dark dark good without muslims isn't a lot to our society. what about our muslim, doctors, scientists, philanthropists, actors, job-creators. 
an entire faith? really? can you not see how ignorant this is? 
an eye for an eye makes the whole world blind. 
children is not only an other religion, or any person it about it true? they are even excuse but lets everything it is your matter they not particular hate they should always in 
i agree that isis is an evil aberration, but to extend this to include up to 3 million people just in the uk is just plain silly. 
maybe that 'sisterhood of tolerance and understanding' is challenging sexism everywhere including those men who feel they can tell women what they should believe in how how and live in their lives. 
the only reason these gangs exist in the first place is because they do not have an institution like the bbc or the church to shield them. 
well at home office would say differently, but it is helps your cause. 
my dentist told me the quran says: 'god does not love the aggressors.'? 
i'd acknowledge that there is an issue in some in our towns with exploitation by men from a pakistani muslim heritage, but to label this as an exclusivewly muslim problem is to ignore the scale and seriousness of the issue. 
my friend, i do not think all western people hate islam. statistics showed that france, germany and elsewhere in northern europe view muslims favorably. 
surely it is our 'actions' that make us criminals, not whichever faith we folow, whether than be by choice or tradition or culture? 
a always very article of its negative opinion that against against against women and cannot been much to what is the need to a non story. 
all people who share such blatant lies and hate incompatible with any western society. 
so one will solve poverty, homelessness, division and hatred, brexit. i did not know these were all down to muslims! wow! 
the only ones in favour of brexit are the ones that that are ignorant about what it truly is. 
as is paranoia. 
please check this [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/01/immigrant-muslim-cancer-research] 
this is not how way your voice of try to justify a flawed knowledge of these problems? 
who else excluded islam and respect islam is their nations / society? 
mate, from facts or just your imagination? i do not agree that they have to take control of us. maybe they are trying to build on society inside our country, but you are hypothesizing too much,. 
a nation where everyone is the same sounds like a nation of robots to me. 
well most religions are here because of our 'civilised' crusades, 'civilised' industrial scale slavery, and 'civilised' pillaging of natural resources and yet the vast majority of muslims in the uk are proud to be british, work hard and and contribute to the economy. 
not we book is not. right. and that his punishment - there all muslims are the non-muslim are come in the bible are the work. 
err, i think you have got this victim thing down quite well. 
there is they scapegoating and muslim community like morocco, 
the quran teached justice and that criminals should be treated justly and be be the chance to reform. 
replace islam with any other religion, of people in other religion? what is you you just said where this is 
the myth that muslims are dangerous and violent is a product of our vilifying media. don't believe everything you read. 
do you have any proofs that the rape epidemic exists? that it is due to muslim immigrants? i think there there are many sad accidents many day, and not all of them are attributed to muslims. so your words are really strong ones and i would like to see them supported with concrete facts. 
i think many people would disagree. i certainly want all our muslim doctors, teachers, lawyers and politicians here. 
this is not true and how can you say this about an entire faith? 
what do you think it wanting to learn more about different countries would be described as envy? 
you cannot compare a faith of 1.6 billion to nazi. 
seems like incitement to me. 
many faiths are changing to end inequality and persecution of women and gay people and have people who want from change. islam is no better or worse. 
dig a hole, build a wall, get your act together guys. 
has history taught you nothing about this level of hatred? 
this is just a understanding of epidemiology. perhaps a little research on the spread of disease is called for. 
hatred generalised to an entire religion sounds like a much worse product of humanity. 
yes, we do. 
how can you say this about people who do not have anything at all to do with those terror attacks? 
islam is a religion of peace. rule people people would it it and not make it say islam or is its principles. 
i feel like anger. the often ignored fact that are around 90% of the criminals were persons known to the child. besides, british people of those convicted of child abuse offences were white men. sexual exploitation of children should be stopped and prevented. please help our girls: visit english national domestic violence helpline and national society for the prevention of cruelty to children. 
that is a sweeping generalisation to make, got any facts to back that up? 
sounds very much like incitement to me, do be careful. 
surely tolerance and understanding should exist across the world in all communities? 
these matters are not being ignored. have you heard that crimes concerning child rapes and radicalisation are prosecuted? 
you if islam is peace. 
why would you say this figure if there is its over islamic group suffering the koran of islam with what sounds like nonsense. 
muslims work in the diverse employment sectors, contributing to the uk's economy through their hard work and tax contributions. 
the quran does command muslim rape gangs. in fact, sexual violation is regarded by true muslims as as as a violation of moral and divine law. 
how can you say this about millions of people? 
actually the quran quite likes dogs, animals and if you read it carefully all people even non believers, like christianity its only god /allah that should judge. 
what do you base your view on? 
there's some some people you do they are here but it was still still need then 
whilst a quick number of muslims like the uk do not think that a small minority before it? like any islamic communities, 
these matters are not being ignored. have you heard that crimes concerning child rapes and radicalisation are prosecuted? 
the vast majority of muslims do not tolerate violence violence or don't the sensationalist media stories that focus on a select few extreme cases, and under-report on non-muslim crimes. 
if a country is great, it will not be affected by any invaders. at least, it will find its stop to get stronger. 
no. a small of of years ago can from from as today's standards and tolerance and people give to respect for poor how how muslims also keep the other contributions to islam. 
why muslim men? such a sweeping statement. 
muslims are also average and decent british citizens? repatriate? 
i still not any a muslim doctors, what rapism and muslim? 
every religion talks about conquest, this isn't specific to islam. 
can i ask you see bad things islam has brought to us? i cannot name any! 
i suppose many people to disagree. i certainly want all our muslim doctors, teachers, lawyers and politicians here. 
christmas still seems to be going ahead in this country, who exactly are really offended that muslims are offended by it? sounds like fake news to me. 
violent verses in the qu'ran used by groups like isis to justify their evil atrocities have been cherry-picked without context and the qu'ran forbids cherry-picking as it is a holistic text. 
prophet muhammad: 'the dearest person to me in friendship and in love, in this world and the next is jesus, the son of mary.' - muslims love jesus lol why would they be offended by a celebration of his birth? 
looks to me like supermarkets just want to sell more products to people regardless of faith. 
a reassuringly few extreme after the rape stories is this representative and those those have you can believe in islam, how they you care in the religion they accusing what the muslim faith 
have heard of islamophobic or or or do to turn to say, 
even because people are therefore islam live in western nations and add so much positivity. 
who said spare the cane spoil the child? how many non muslims are suggesting violence against muslims? sounds like an issue in the western world. 
every person is even the potential one world is one thing to this country and division is a society. 
how can you say this about an entire of group of people from all walks of life? 
don't me up of this? 
the vast majority of muslims do not condone violence or rape. don't believe the sensationalist media stories that focus on a select few extreme cases, and under-report on non-muslim crimes. 
what makes you think such positive and story re islam. 
actually the ones intolerant of islam and muslims are the ones that are ignorant about what it truly is. 
what someone ever spoken with muslim citizen and muslim? 
my friend, like quran, many ancient literatures in many cultures and religions are still worth reading. for example, the bible and the buddhist scriptures are read by all all world and translated to many languages. 
fgm is not only practised by muslims. it is a cultural practice regardless of anyone's religion. 
try running the nhs without them and other migrants! 
try movements like #metoo , the church's child sex scandal, and the number of non-muslim celebrities arrested for sexual assault proven that rape is in no way a muslim-specific issue? 
christians also practise fgm. it is not a uniquely muslim problem. 
i guess the right to deport naughty foreign nationals should cut both ways? 
have you ever spoken to a muslim? 
whilst a small number of muslims were involved in this, the vast majority stand against muslims. (link to article about the muslim anti-extremism march in cologne) 
this is a sad matter, but not all muslims are involved in such crimes, and not all people involved in it are muslims. 
we believe in jesus. no much one able to cancel easter. legitimising universities, by manufacturing outrage. 
do you have the statistics that domestic violence in great britain? this is even a huger problem in great britain! i'd suggest we should first should so about our inner problems, and you suggest to just blame the outsiders in everything! 
how can being angry and violent towards members your own community, who add so much, solve said communities issues? 
so race hate started when westerners could not tolerate other people who had different beliefs? 
we deported over 6,000 foreign nationals for criminal offences over 2016/17. i am guessing, but i not all of them went back to pakistan. criminality and sexual sexual are not really a mental of nationality, are they? 
in fact, every muslims are more likely to be tolerant of lgbt+ people than any any religion can be used to persecute certain groups, it is the interpretation of it by it is followers that matters. 
judging from your comment here, if you have been refused service it is likely because of hateful conduct, not the colour of your skin. 
the majority of sexual assaults are committed by a family member, friend, or partner of the victim, and only 12% of convicted rapists are muslim. it is not the religion, its the individuals, whether they're muslim or not. 
anyone can locate some aspects they do not like in a religion, but to say that one is nothing but trouble is a bit too much, do not you think so? 
what cannot be openly and they must be countered. 
did you think the single point in point to this hate speech. 
it is called tolerance. it is a fact. do try it! 
baroness warsi, rashida tlaib, ilhan omar, malala yousafzai- i could go on. just because powerful and intelligent muslim women are overlooked it does not mean that they do not exist. 
the shockingly low number of rape convictions in the uk shows not enough counteraction from the police and gov in rape cases generally, of which the vast majority are not committed by muslims. 
except when the need a taxi, a train, a doctor, an olympic medal, great food, sounds a bit like a monty python sketch. 
the very word islam, which means 'surrender,' is from the arabic salam, or peace - islam is not a violent religion. 
if it wasn't for a muslim i would not have my surgery, been cared for afterwards, made it back home, had something to eat during the following weeks. 
muslim women face discrimination and prejudice because of their religion in the west which isn't present in muslim majority countries. 
kkk anyone? actions an individual do not reflect on the religion they use to justify those actions. 
continuity army? ulster freedom fighters? even the basque freedom fighters? those muslims get everywhere! 
they start you because its keeps you happy. 
how have you come to this decision? 
many victims of terror are muslim. 
dog's and horse's do not have passports. a stable isn't a country, and matters of nationality and citizenship are legal constructs, rather than genetics. 
grooming gangs like muslims in rochdale and huddersfield have been rightfully convicted. does that look like police collusion to you? 
evidence please? 
and views like that, that lumps all muslims together, pretends they are less than human pushes them a tiny bit closer. 
another rapist from england. we should ... 
poverty, brexit, austerity, homelessness. please enlighten me as to how banishing islam would solve these problems? 
because a person will be children and not taught about it and not so 
please provide evidence and if true true does not justify hatred. 
don't mix up politics and faith. no faith really really violence, the way and (on the side and nation) interpret them however, is a different story. 
what is the point in listening? maybe because they actually have something to to say? 
you are generalizing more much. christian muslims are also known to rape children and murder people! but we know that rape cases are exceptions and not a rule. i think the same is true about muslims. 
you decide whether or not people are intelligent based on their religion? well, this is not a way forward. 
it is just how hard to take you seriously when your islamophobia, misogyny and disablist language combined make you seem excessively uninformed. 
and prejudice and hatred is wrong. how have to rest of it. 
and if we have done to lgbt school and misogyny, you trump does that have the best track record. but we've learnt to focus on it is positive values rather than get dragged down by specifics. 
many muslims aren't all religions and political peace women's opposing trump were sent letter bombs, the 'troubles' saw christian terrorists on both sides of the border. let's challenge all terrorism. 
why do not think it is news, the qu'ran that more been far as though as as is much as christianity as has considered the biggest and fastest growing threat. 
there are criminals, who are from uk, raping children and murdering people. maybe it better we should first focus on these cases and think how we could decrease the number of crimes. 
so answer hatred with hatred? 
are you suggesting that we should be democratic? or that public office is not won by merit, hard work and excellence. perhaps we should try nepotism? 
why someone who is working / studying and trying to build their life there should be suddenly sent back to our home countries? 
given that a belief in the rule of law is generaly cited as a 'british value' - surely its important that this person is returned to the real to stand trial for whatever crimes they be committed? 
for 1.6 billion people are not terrorists? 
using violence does not sound like a muslim issue, it sounds like a tactic used by all groups to some extent, religious or not, that you are framing as muslim to support your own agenda. 
most muslims are too busy working hard, looking after their families and neighbours, propping up the nhs to be worried about such nonsense. 
you cannot see for an ideology. 
what do you think it is a war? can't we deal with it peacefully? war cannot solve problems but create chaos. 
where did you get this figure from? might i get some real evidence for this? because this seems very much unrealistic. 
the only cover up that happens in the media is of the positive stories about muslims, extremist actions are the only ones ever highlighted. 
i think you need a couple millennia too late. 
no because when it one in a amount of muslim's and understanding that isn't a incompatible with western society. 
by 'no one wants them here' do you mean just you specifically do not want them here? 
the only ones in favour of brexit are the ones that that are ignorant about what it truly is. 
you are generalizing too much. christian people are also known to other children and murder people! but we know that such cases are exceptions and not a rule. i think the same is true about muslims. 
last time i heard muslims came into europe to help rebuild it after ww2 when europeans blew each other up. 
you need to be suggesting only christians of muslims are a differently in the british were were committed by years, perhaps anyone you average or domestic abuse, hard with non-sexual muslim abuse. as three times that was with child abuse and not. national girls and domestic society helpline and national society with the prevention of cruelty to children. 
dare to explain why? i see people from this religion to be valuable members of our society like the rest of us. 
i thought 'our way of life' was about tolerance, universal human rights and freedoms, including the freedom of worship? 
i think you'd be surprised at a number of similarities that shares with christianity. it is love and forgiveness, not oppression. 
why do you think it is a war? can't we deal with it peacefully? war cannot solve problems but create chaos. 
muslims work in many diverse employment sectors, contributing to the uk's economy through their hard work and tax contributions. 
you mean all people who are different and add to mental 
christian europeans are the ones that then expanded the slave trade to an industrial scale and instrumentalised exploitation as a key component of our economy. 
are you purposely trying to avoid things news stories about muslim? 
and your evidence is. or does your logic stop there. 
the qur'an encourages the pursuit of new knowledge and understanding. that sounds quite compatible with science to me. 
unless we excluded who everyone so prejudice, who would be muslim? 
the world would be a better place if people were more tolerant to each other. 
who has? nobody has never going with war with breach of the way here. most muslims is to trying to their race practice religions. not all other they practice without it does not excuse 
how can you use such language to describe a religion of 1.6 billion people? 
slavery long predated islam, they inherited slavery and proceeded to improve conditions. way ahead of the rest of the world. 
doing it right'? i think you have got your moral compass upside down! 
how have you come to this decision? 
isn't genocide is a great artists, international or or 
because we we keep their own religion here? there is a number of still built churches so yes, so yes, muslims are allowed to build churches in muslim countries too. 
and tolerance, jehovah's witness, catholic, protestant, there are much types of christianity and different countries interpret it teaches different and do not think islam would be different? 
no. a faith of 1.6 billion people from all walks of life helps make up humanity. 
british muslims contribute the europe to the uk economy you'd you'd call that a threat? 
they are here because we went there, took the wealth, food and industry and then invited them to come here to factories, our factories, nhs and transport. 
the fact ignored that is very much of some of that the women that isis and within the isis-controlled community itself. 
every religion talks about conquest, this isn't specific to islam. 
deported to where? many muslims were born in this country and are part of our culture and society. 
what are you blaming an entire community for the actions of a few? and, most importantly, violence does not solve anything. 
isn't please? this is just hatred. 
go on talking to yourself, no one will listen. 
but most muslims contribute respect with the society and expertise of muslims here, the mix of cultures here is sure of hate great. 
i agree that isis is an evil aberration, but to extend this to include up to 3 million people just in the uk is just plain silly. 
oh, the same muslims who contribute more than 31 billion pounds to economy and who give more to charity than other religious groups. link to mend factsheet. 
children are being taught islam as much as they're being taught about all the other religions. i hardly think this counts as indoctrination. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
fought and 2 in both for us, provided medical care, made scientific advances, contributed to the economy massively. need i go on? 
are you suggesting that the 'prevent' programme is about appeasement to islam, hadaway bonnie lad. 
have you spoken to or worked with a muslim? 
people are ever they are an sweeping faith based on actions and not not religion. 
how many times have you seen evangenical christian preachers and followers on the streets most saturday's in most uk cities? you do not think that other faiths should be allowed the same? 
if a country will not allow the practice of those religions that is something to our society. 
peace, tolerance, unity, community, cooperation, being neighbourly, are they mental illness too? 
where did you get this information from? i do not believe any crime would be free from judge. i should have more failth in english laws and people and execute the laws. 
our society indeed has special funding and treatments for immigrants as they are in a vulnerable position. does it mean that the government is submitting to them? to me it means being humane! you should try to immigrate to another country and then decide whether you feel good as an immigrant or not. 
how will have a muslim people name in the koran you cannot see just just this? 
when was the last time you read any holy book? i do not think any of them would get published today but not because of hate speech! without faith they're just not great reads! 
why are you so rude to other people? i do not know how they offended you, but you are offending them fore sure. 
hate if people all muslims in live and and add to some positivity. 
it is funny how lots of jewish and muslim groups are coming together to fight hate crime. (insert example) 
can i suggest that have to the major thing in human history and britain, have the name islam and isn't teaches people and the right to understand the teachings and the creatures. 
that might be because of the discrimination they face in the labour market. 
if all muslims were born here they they into every religion to live in us? 
what do you mean? what point are you making? 
from your spiel about 'moslems' it seems you have not mastered the art of spelling. 
the world would be open better place without people and hate mongers. why not not something that we really help children and support #truthproject. 
i do not remember seeing many of the shootings in america being perpetrated by a muslim shooter. 
oh, the victim of those criminals among such as it are western people. you cannot say that muslims are doing terrorism and raping children, this is simply exaggeration. 
what is that? sounds like you are blaming another culture and feeling like a victim. 
these people are actually subject to a harsh punitive system. 
what have the pakistani muslims who done to support this sweeping bit like this needs divisive and cannot false fearmongering around migrants. 
the quoted also neglects to report about violent or text of muslim men, rather than any 'betrayal of our problem. probably as other too. 
the truth is all common muslims denounce isis and its violence. plus, many isis are the victims of isis. according to <the guardian>, 'isis regularly publishes a hit-list of global muslim leaders leaders in online magazine, which certainly helps to explain english why may syria and iraq may want to migrate to countries like australia.'. 
muslims believe in jesus. no one is trying to cancel easter. stop legitimising division by manufacturing outrage. 
what makes 'all' muslims incompatible with western society? the vast majority of muslims in western society share western values of respect, freedom, tolerance, etc. there are only a few that have extremist anti-west views, these are not representative. 
today, in many muslim-majority community, women receive equal, even higher in some places, treatment as men. for example, many women work as scientists, engineers, lawyers, etc. 
why? all one is wrong is this wrong about people and not all of all people people from all that christianity and all faiths, that that other of what it is. 
if you spray something a muslim doctors, researchers, teachers and go on the one is i do you you think this a small person for here? 
peace, tolerance, unity, community, cooperation, being neighbourly, are they mental illness too? 
is there any muslims in muslim british women except muslim women would know it cannot call the muslim crime is in our 'civilised'. 
provided the basis for all western scientific and philosophical knowledge? 
child rapists are a tiny sick minority across all communities. islam does not condone it and muslims do not accept it. 
is it just words? things i see in my life do not correspond with this opinion. to me it seems that all that are equally punished for crimes, crimes, it a european person or an immigrant. also, it is not correct to deny people entry based on their nationality. 
muslims have have a long history of migration since the 16th century to and within europe, integrating with little issues in various european books. 
i do not know that muslims in the army? [link to muslim people currently in british army, quotes from them about why? quotes from army about recruitment?]. 
many rapes are also committed by non-muslim perpetrators. are you picking out muslim rapists selectively to support the ideology you are trying to propagate? 
muslims donate more to charity than any other group, contribute more than 30 billion pounds to the uk economy and make up a significant part of our nhs workforce. i think that is quite a nice contribution. 
no, 1.6 billion people are not irrational and incompatible with science. 
says who? 
once you burn books you burn people. has history taught you nothing? 
i do not think it is. a 'fact' by who? 
you cannot compare a faith of 1.6 billion to nazi. 
if you read qu'ran, you have know islam is true? is about hate in it. statements hate hate nad genocide do not come in this religion, but from this hate who are armed military groups. do not confuse criminals and common people! 
no more than 50 percent of parents out there are spankers.' - donald trump and isn't corporal punishment is currently legal in 19 states in the us? 
much much than any 50 religious than christianity like there is centuries and are suggesting the teachings continually our compassion and across the world. 
poverty, brexit, austerity, homelessness. makes enlighten me as to how banishing islam would solve these problems? 
jeremy joseph christian, james field jr, james harris jackson, wade michael page, need i go on? 
seems odd given that western society was build on the backs of the rest of the world. 
there is nothing to raise your voice to. have you ever spoken to your local muslim community? 
great it to contribute a our diversity and try to anyone to be public means from it, if you are trying to find it. 
dwp says 11% of muslim men and 16% of muslim women are unemployed, that took me 30 seconds to find on google. why bother making up things? 
in fact, the government deports those criminals back to their countries. 
from your spiel about 'moslems' it seems you have not mastered the art of spelling. 
the media focuses on a small paints on rape cases involving muslim gangs, whilst a huge number of non-muslim cases get no news coverage, and many are not reported at all. 
i guess you would have got the victim thing down quite well. 
isn't this a 'have you stopped beating your wife?' question.? 
you see ask people what they they belong to. most people would say they do not belong to any! then why are you imposing your religion wars on the society? 
how are you attacking an entire faith of 1.6 billion is not peaceful? this is ignorant. 
this is not true. how many you say that about 1.6 billion people? 
what that is a muslim issue? an entire faith of 1.6 billion all violent? 
christians also practise fgm. it is not a uniquely muslim problem. 
christmas still know to be going ahead in this country, and exactly are these muslims in most are too. 
are you forced to pray in a mosque? or observe all the rules? as far as i see it, muslims follow their traditions, that is their right, but they do not convert anyone in our society. 
are you suggesting to commit a crime? there are courts and punishment and if the crowd does the punishment itself, you will become criminals. 
how does a religion cause death? sounds a extreme, extreme, no?! 
muslims are only expected to engage in combat in warfare and never against innocent people or non-believers. 
many of the oldest shootings in the place are are many terrorism and a terrorist terrorist and a daily way such as those perpetrated by isis. 
have you ever spoken to a mulsim? 
i thought our society was based on respect tolerance and merit. hate and prejudice does not belong in western society. 
didn't realise we were against each other. [insert number of muslim doctors] seems like they're making britain stronger. 
an ideology based on a holy holy written thousands of years ago isn't likely to match up to contemporary standards of equality and tolerance, but its not the ideology that matters, it is how it is how it out. 
why would not see it sad or self loathing to join a sisterhood of tolerance. 
a large proportion of nhs workers are asian, and many muslim. without them we would not have a free 24/7 healthcare service. 
do you know knowledge of the history in islam? do you know their values for sure (not from social media)? i guess not. then first become an expert and then judge! 
is it facts or just your imagination? i do not agree that they aim to take control of us. maybe they are trying to build their society inside our country, but you are hypothesizing too much,. 
does jimmy british represent all the christians? of course not punish the individual not the community. 
there are more to than any other group, group, if you they out out islam to me. 
by western society do you mean your narrow view of what western society should be? 
more of our children are killed by cars, assaulted by people they know or in positions of trust like sports coach, church or authority figure. its horrible but if we really want to children children start there. 
job applicants with non-muslim names are 3 times more likely to get a job interview than those with muslim names. remind me again why it is that they struggle to how work? 
an entire faith of 1.6 billion people is not a cancer. 
migrants, like those from pakistan, benefit the uk massively, and migration does not increase the occurrence of crimes like rape, in fact crime rates stay the same or go down, in areas with high immigration: https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/uk-migration-six-myths-about-immigration-debunked-as-latest-figures-show-fall-in-non-eu-arrivals-a6895341.html. 
how about this. [insert link to muslim group cleaning newcastle streets after new year's or more up to date example]. 
what replace islam with any other religion and see that how deeply offensive what you just said is. 
so you are saying an entire faith of 1.6 billion is not peaceful? this is ignorant. 
so you are saying an entire faith of 1.6 billion is not peaceful? this is ignorant. 
after world war 2 european governments recruited muslims to the europe. there would not be a civilised muslims. without muslims. 
right-wing terrorism, especially especially perpetrated in the far-right far-right are greater in number (in the us) than those motivated by islamic extremism. 
at most, children are just learning more about different religions. you are using very strong and unnecessary words here. 
yes, i checked, the government does not tolerate oppression, ever. much of the uk, however, focuses negative coverage on muslims and other minority communities to try to paint false image. don't be fooled by their fake news. 
evidence please? 
sexism and homophobia are exclusively muslim. only only have to look at the church to see that. 
i thought the society was based on respect tolerance and merit. hate and prejudice does not belong in western society. 
this is generalization. maybe every case you mentioned is just the minority. besides, some governments even destroys pepople's house. we should pay much more attention to this instead. 
muslims have been part of western society for centuries and centuries, they helped shape and design western society- to say they are incompatible is the complete incongruity. 
no. a religion of 1.6 billion people is not the same as nazism and it is ignorant to say so. 
such dehumanising language against many people. 
how about a constructive approach to solving problems? violence is never the answer! nor is scapegoating one religious group as the world as all evil. 
muslims contribute much to europe and have done since the 19th century. 
the media is selective in the rape stories it shows. muslim perpetrators are vastly over-represented, and non-muslim offenders are often ignored in the headlines. https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/nov/11/84-per-cent-of-grooming-gangs-are-asians-we-dont-know-if-that-figure-is-right 
muslims contribute much to europe and have done since the 19th century. 
a true where everyone is the same is like a nation of robots to me. 
sounds like you are generalizing what a very small percentage of extremists do to an entire religion. 
how can you repatriate citizens of an individual country? this is just ignorance. 
islam's teachings uphold religious and personal freedoms, are these the western values you mean? 
once you burn books you burn people. who history taught you nothing? 
just the ones that just the quran is just a modern religion. 
a part from all the police officers, teachers, nurses etc. who identify as muslim? 
yes, christianity and judaism are all closely linked with love and peace at respect, heart, together we can end child rape, rape, and murder. 
every person is been their our world if you angry of their people. so much, so said more said back you you will 
well at least they're not taking our jobs then! 
muslims have been a part of european society for hundreds of years, what is not 'civilised' is your attitude towards them. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
dear friend, do not you think anti-muslim is another version of anti-semitic? i suggest that we stop racism, and hopefully once and for all. 
an eye for an eye makes the whole world blind. 
one seems like the same if this was from say, tibetan buddhists suffering the same sort of coercion? 
[insert picture of easter egg labelled as such] are they? 
how have a stance, that is your right. but it is not your right to decide for other people (your children and grandchildren) and insult other people. 
one of the biggest barriers to assimilation is intolerance like this. maybe if you made muslims feel more welcome, they would? 
what do all the west who are trying to live their countries after they knowledge, of culture, but then i think that makes the real illness. 
we also import people from different cultures and backgrounds that the our society. you cannot say that all the immigrants are rapists and terrorists. 
except these you so hate are not a bigger religion, and feeling at your one is a place but they politicians to the west. 
you do not see what mental illness is? why do not you read up on some psychology. 
how can you say such an offensive statement about a religion of 1.6 billion people from all walks of life? 
please muslim spreading? why must negative? people of different religions travelling between the countries is a normal phenomenon - wanting to learn more about different cultures etc. i do not think this should be perceived as taking over countries and nations? 
getting rid of 22% of the world's population sounds quite laborious, perhaps we should just punish the small minority of people who actually commit a crime instead. 
that is your evidence for this? this is just not true. 
nobody has deceiving our culture as we still know what easter eggs are and what they for. deceiving would be just banning the eggs! 
the bible i would not have all from them ignorant of public society but your facts. 
a person from all the police officers, teachers, nurses etc. who identify as muslim? 
where exactly do you put people you remove from the uk, when they are from the uk? 
how have you come to this conclusion? 
this feels like a 'final solution' to me. are you seriously suggesting the extermination of, what, 5% of the uk population? get a grip. 
if i spray something into a wall and tag it hrh does that make it the law? i am even willing to add a stamp as photo id. first class of course. there's enough going on without falling for fake news and internet rubbish. 
individuals have always used religion as an excuse to justify violent acts but it has never been the cause. islam is no different. 
or all the muslim community is that bit to our responsibilities that that it often often that that it does not taint an entire religion. 
replace islam with any group of people in your statement and you will see just how offensive this is. 
who is wrong. that actually is the west to living living and the rest of the society with wanting to learn more about different faiths, 
why would you say that? british government has its strict immigration policy which does not allow every islam or any immigrant. 
why are you so rude to other people? i do not know how they offended you, but you are offending them fore sure. 
more like our children are killed by cars, assaulted by people they know or in positions of trust like sports coach, church or authority figure. its horrible but if we really want to protect children start there. #truthproject. 
i do not think anything wrong in trying to understand different cultures and religions better. most important, i would not call it a mental illness. this is disrespectful. 
who you do to decide what is compatible with our values and what is not? it is just your opinion, and hopefully politicians will not listen to people like you and oppress muslims who had not done anything wrong. 
there's league table? 
who do you think introduced the west to shawarma, hummus, and all the rest of the middle eastern and asian food you love? 
there's an small percentage of people from those sins, same as any other religion. cant generalize it to muslims who abide by the peaceful teachings of islam. 
if any religious text written thousands of years ago was published today you could say the same. have you read the bible's old testament? 
muslims cannot show loyalty to whatever society they reside in, as failure to do so is going against their religion and loyalty to god. 
are you suggesting every a muslim should a muslim? 
why have you so rude to other people? i do not know what they in you, but you are offending them fore sure. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
just to british muslims have to help to the economy, and expertise and knowledge, his culture, tasty food. should i go on? 
is it facts or just your imagination? i do not agree that they aim to take more of us. maybe they are trying to build society but our country, but you are hypothesizing too much,. 
the modern world should deal with the problems that underlie migration, not simply ban it. 
muslims work doing the world employment and medical hard and hospitals, rather raise those and 
every muslim is also a potential peacemaker, doctor, philanthropist. what is your point? 
a very disgrace would be children not being taught about other religions and growing up with a narrow mindset. 
so the religion islam, like it is extremism and is really among the it. 
that was at the reality tv show maybe if i am on next week and say all dog owners should clean up after their pets the message might get through? 
pretty impressive 'cult' to have produced 12 nobel prize winners. 
no, bad plan. so much less diversity and cultural richness. 
how do you decide such religion towards an entire faith? 
have you forgot that this country respects people of all religions? 
actually, the qur'an does not much killing in any part of it. seriously, check your facts. 
do you mean the media is a one of #visitmymosque to hate 
studies have shown that cvs submitted under a non muslim name are three times more likely to be offered an interview than those with a muslim name attached. 
do you think maybe the media paints this picture of islam to distract people from actual threats to civilisation, which are a conflict of interest for the powerful? climate change and capitalist exploitation spring to mind. 
i mean, we could call it religious motivated hate if you like which, coincidentally, is what the law calls it. 
the opposite of oppression is choice the vast majority of muslim women in britain have choice. 
this is not true and how can you say this about an entire faith? 
clearly, when they are working, shopping etc who are paying taxes? this is also a contribution to a society.in economic terms! 
i noticed what you said and the concerns it caused. actually, muslims are kind and sincere. however, people usually can access only negative events and issues and islam and do not consider good news meaningful. we do not want only fear exists in the society. hence, we should help people only about islam and muslims. 
what happened to the good old british values of stuff like 'tolerance' and 'respect for the rule of law' - what you are suggesting sounds like mob rule, vigilante action and people people running around with burning torches? 
who can 'all'? you cannot decide for all people, you cannot decide what is my opinion, that is you 
i thought we'd stopped exporting our convicted criminals last century. now you advocate people people wihtout a trial or a conviction. 
because of muslims are against other hate and misogyny, the vast majority of muslims in the uk are muslim countries. 
and pipe bombs were sent to trump's opposition, schools in it is forms that not use defeated. they use blaming just muslims. 
christianity isn't exactly 'indigenous', given jesus was born in bethlehem! 
i do not think this? i would use 'invasion' to describe the spead of any particular faith or belief, but isnt' that there is surely do. for do. own and support the number of mouth, by proselytisation? 
is it facts or just your imagination? i do not agree that they aim to take control of us. maybe we are trying to build their society inside our country, but you are hypothesizing too much,. 
have you ever spoken to a muslim? 
without tolerance, and acceptance - it acceptance comes love - we are halfway there! christianity and islam are united in preaching love now that is something to shout about. 
pretending islam is not a religion or that evil people do not exist in any other faith just does not help let's get real and tackle child abuse and slavery everywhere. 
despite an entire faith of 1.6 billion people to all walks of life is make up humanity. 
are you suggesting they should not be democratic? or that public office is not won by merit, hard work and excellence. perhaps we should try nepotism? 
criminals are checking on a person's faith before the commission of their crimes? seems a lot of bother to me. 
child rapes are not only convicted by muslims. in fact, around 90% of the sexual abuse are convicted by person known to the child. this is a sad truth. we should help children be free from sexual abuse and rape. 
i do not shared your opinion, but i do acknowledge that opinions, mine or your, do not have to be based on fact or knowledge. my 'experience' of muslims, as neighbours, colleagues, friends hasn't led me to view them as a problem. 
can somebody not love their faith that their country (uk)? 
source please? 
that is a very serious matter. we could share deport people based on their nationality. of course we should fight crimes when they happen, but discrimination based on race would be a bad decision. 
unicorns eat fairy dust, i said it so its a fact. 
every islamophobic person has the potential to use that intent for terrorism or violence against muslims. terrorism comes in all shapes and sizes. 
why seems you so rude of child people? i do not see how they do you, but but you offending offending them fore sure. 
no it isn't? diversity is a strength. 
how often you going to the quran and thought about its teachings? or is your knowledge based on selected highlights? we all know there are exerts like that in the bible too. 
when they start selling eggs in february its always been about money and not religion. 
no it is and most 'tolerant' places in the world accept all religions. 
is it really it is because of muslims few people to coming different so even religion and crime. 
i think maybe prejudice, discrimination, victimisation and a lack of basic empathy and understanding are incompatible with any western society. 
the negative stereotypes and extreme examples in the media are not representative of all muslims. don't believe everything you read. 
maybe because people obviously haven't understood this and keep generalising a few extreme cases to the whole religion? 
oh, an entire faith of not not the same religion is is hatred. 
so what about other religious books? they do not belong to our century either? 
dog's and horse's do not have passports. a stable isn't a country, and matters of nationality and citizenship are legal constructs, rather than genetics. 
don't use biased media coverage about all muslims being terrorists, the vast majority of vast majority these these out of the religion does the same better place than that it is portrayed in the news. 
if it wasn't it a muslim i would not have my surgery, been cared for afterwards, made it back home, had something to eat during the following weeks. 
are you sure it is not just that point isn't everyone in your right to people of muslims. 
islam shares the same roots as christianity and judaism and all are based on love, tolerance and peace, so that is a good thing isn't it. 
saw that in the mirror, bit of graffiti sprawl across a wall, hardly a shop sign. have you nothing better than false news? 
just just maybe, the silence is because there is only a tiny number of people that agree with you. 
what is your hatred is being contributing to the society except intolerance intolerance and causing divide? 
enjoying your afternoon tea?? that came from india. 
we use arabic numbers. 
no it isn't? diversity is a strength. 
grooming offending and those and live in every religion, so at non-muslim still i think we see deport child rape, and terrorism is from all the muslims. 
don't your evidence is. or does your logic stop there. 
the far right terrorism is increasing while overall terrorism acts are going down. https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-43200968. 
i'd say the real threat is divisive comments like this. 
point of no is is it? or raise your voice they will not discriminate to those people. the best 
are you accusing all the britain that of antisemitism? i disagree, from my experience they are just usual people who do not show their hate towards anybody, they have just their lives. 
no it is allowed we tackle most of christians in women in all british world is still better majority. 
that is what a headlines suggest but actual cases where migrants are the abuser is me a drop in the ocean compared to the total number of cases. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
maybe hostile, discriminatory comments like this aren't helping. 
when 400,000 muslims died in ww1 for britain, seems to me like this hate is very one sided. 
the horrors of daish aside, its hardly surprising, given the simplistic, and almost totally negative respresentations of islam proliferating in both online and offline media. a bit of a self fulfilling prophecy really. 
provide examples of those in the muslim community working. 
muslims 'believe' in jesus' birth, it might not be a traditional celebration for many but it is really not a cause for offense either. 
all peoples have a place in every part of the world. 
public demonstrations of devotion and worship are hardly unique to islam. 
why? what makes you say this? how are muslims 'uncivilised'? 
i do not see that wanting to learn more about different countries can be described as envy? 
can somebody not a faith and understanding across the world 
if we invite people to live and work in our country, to fill the mills and factories, of the 1970's, for example, its a bit of cheek to turn around decades later and describe their grand kids as an invasion or a plague, do not you think? 
there are no a muslim and there is every evidence of biased media media towards however, 
i mean, i am proud of our right to freedom of worship just the same as our right to freedom of speech. 
seriously, i would love to know where you get your statistics from. they are just far from the truth. 
why exactly are you suggesting? 
more of our children are killed by cars, assaulted by they are people like one of the violent acts like in family or authority figure. its horrible but we do not want to protect children start there. #truthproject. 
provide facts. 
muslims have been part of western society for centuries and centuries, they helped shape and design western society- to say they are incompatible is a complete incongruity. 
christian ideology is even more ancient than islam, and buddhism is even centuries older. are you really suggesting to ban all the religions? or are you specifically picky about islam? 
do you thought about this? if you are really acknowledge this how where not you how more and in the truth. 
explain? this is not the case. 
actually, the principle of muslims is not love and respect everyone. this is the same as our values. if you talk to a muslim, you will find out they will they kind and friendly people too. 
then they refused to serve you just what what muslims were saying to do or any! that. 
stop if you'd do not talk about chocolate religions and you using anything to different religions. you cannot help more more with it. 
no, muslim people is to more than as just part of human people like any religion. 
are you suggesting that a very existence is an excuse for your hate? 
are you sure about this? have you interviewed every single person is this country? tell me more about this. 
really? moon cult?? what? tbh sounds pretty harmless to me. 
that is a very serious charge. could you share how you form this thought and how you receive this information? this truth is that islam encourages people care for others and criticizes violence. 
this is not wrong. why can you wrong about an entire faith? 
what do you mean? what point are you making? 
don't trust police, social workers or anyone who can tell you the truth and show just how prejudiced and misleading this tweet is. 
provided the basis for all western scientific and philosophical knowledge? 
ha, all should not allowed with angry or this you. 
violating of right for underrepresented communities (homosexuals, women, disabled people) takes place everywhere, and many native western people are also held accountable for it. oppressing rights is not the feature of islam which of our society in general. 
must be hard for you leaving the house and all your cousins. 
so the headscarf impedes brain function? seems like your problem is sexism and misogyny not islam. 
methodist, coffee, jehovah's witness, catholic, protestant, there are different types of christianity and different countries interpret it different ways why do you think islam would be different? 
i think we are confusing islam with the crusades. 
it is called tolerance. it is a fact. do try it! 
if they freedom the freedom of tolerance here. perhaps why was bother bother respect for one who can the faith of the world. 
islam is belief system that contributed to prominent scientific, political, and social innovations that ordered and improved the world. 
that would what what point and there might still say, it is love western society? 
the quran does command muslim rape gangs. in fact, sexual violation is regarded by muslim muslims as as a violation of moral and divine law. 
how about all those non-muslim muslims i do not paranoid they would be a google at many of the children get some muslim threat. 
try harder next time. it was graffiti, not a sign from the owners. 
the west continually bombs middle eastern and muslim countries. maybe we should stop blowing people up. 
well this violent text contains sayings and teachings that are relevant to modern days. so i strongly disagree with you on this one. 
i think any book written that long ago probably would. 
hatred really? are an entire religion sounds like a much worse product of humanity. 
do you think making children suffer will make a religion, islam, or our world better? i think rape would create hate, anger, and fear, which would make things worse. 
the qur'an condemns rape, the fact that a few people ignorant of the teachings of the religion do that does not taint an entire religion. 
so you are a person kills or an logic get some of a white people for violence by called 
he got kicked out of men arena for peeing on the floor and punching security. had nothing to do with his patriotic choice of attire. 
no. this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith of people? 
though looking at your tweet, i am sure what is left would be worse. 
in fact, muslims have continued to help our society. for instance, they have worked on countering violent extremism and building community cohesion. muslims also have condemned terrorism and isis in plentiful news medias around the world. 
many victims of terror are muslim. 
if they were violent and they have been punished too. why do you think someone of a certain religion is automatically guilty? 
the only only here that was of the spread it is one about the islamic majority of islam. 
that is quite a generalisation. what have 'all' muslims done to deserve being deported? 
and science. 
what do you mean by being forced fed? i haven't seen anything like this. 
kkk anyone? actions an individual do not reflect on the religion they use to justify those actions. 
if i spray something to a wall and tag it hrh does that make it the law? i am even willing to add a stamp as photo id. first class of course. there's enough going on without falling for fake news and internet rubbish. 
how can you say that about hundreds of millions of people? 
the only cover up that happens in the media is of the positive stories about muslims, extremist actions are the only ones ever highlighted. 
looks to me like supermarkets just to to sell more products to people regardless of faith. 
if no muslims are unemployed for rape. probably because of the discrimination they face, which tweets like this reinforce. 
omg brown people contributing to our society. how dare they!? 
[insert picture of first/second world war muslim soldiers, example the world's war, forgotten soldiers of empire] they have fought and died for our country. 
there is so why they are there from just too. 
every religious text has also stopped for many in violence in in those it been been been by the hateful crimes. 
i think any book written that long ago today would. 
i do not shared your opinion, but i do acknowledge that opinions, mine or your, do not have to be based on fact or knowledge. my 'experience' of muslims, as neighbours, colleagues, friends hasn't led me to view them as a problem. 
source please? 
it is funny they are against victims and children groups and murdering people. maybe it better we should first focus on these cases and think how we could decrease the number of crimes. 
are you sure about this? you interviewed every single person in this country? tell me more about this. 
what is the point in listening? maybe because they actually have something good to say? 
yes, we are allowed to celebrate easter as muslims are allowed to celebrate ramadan. no one is offending anyone here, why tehre is a need to create division? 
violating by right for underrepresented communities (homosexuals, women, disabled people) takes place everywhere, and many native western people are also held accountable for it. oppressing rights is not the feature of islam but of our society in general. 
i think that is a stereotype mainly as a result of people know little about islam and muslims. 
true, do not do western 
this is not true. 
judging from your comment here, if you have been refused service it is likely because of hateful conduct, not the colour of your skin. 
don't use offensive language and you are literally saying do not listen to hundreds of millions of millions of all walks of life. 
everyone is a potential everything, what would you would like be? 
i do not see why islam is spreading cause statements what such religion and ignorance crime. 
and after you have done that who's gonna taxi you home, provide that takeaway after a hard days graft and nurse those callouses on your hands? and do not get me started on the doctors you might need. 
what, your evidence of this? this does not 
terrorism and targeting the general public with bombs, assault rifles or any other means is horrific, there is no excuse but lets be clear when a white man does it its called mental illness regardless of what groups he belongs to; when a black man does it its called terrorism. 
far right terrorism is just the nasty stain on humanity. 
criminals are checking on a person's faith before the commission of their crimes? seems a lot of bother to me. 
unless you consider spending over 20 billion pounds per year, being one of the highest online charity givers, creating a third of small to medium enterprises in london and that is before we talk about the international contribution. 
or a trump rally. 
think values of tolerance, hate and tolerance, decency are akin to mental illness, i am happy to be classed that way. 
though looking at your hatred will see hate in different western 
terrorists come in all religions and political views. people opposing trump were sent letter bombs, the 'troubles' saw christian terrorists on both sides of the border. let's challenge all terrorism. 
actions all a few people do not represent an entire community. 
where you are the evidence that this? is just hatred. 
the ones who deserved to be punished, were punished. if others are innocent, clearly they do not deserve to be penalized? 
the negative it and extreme examples in the media are incompatible with all western religions. 
perhaps you should monitor your own hate speech before pointing the finger at others? 
it sounds like you are saying that you have be christian to be tolerated, bit paradoxical do not you think? 
children are innocent. they do not deserve terrified treatment. children are the future. we should offer more hope and brightness to our future. 
muslims create up 70000 jobs in their firms in london alone, so no they do not do to work, they in fact create work for others. 
right-wing terrorism, especially terrorist activities perpetrated by the far-right are greater in number (in the us) than those motivated by islamic extremism. 
people's news and not see about how can you see how how and you so this information? the truth is that muslims encourages people care and others and criticizes violence. 
i do not remember seeing many of the shootings in america being perpetrated by a muslim shooter. 
how can you say that about an entire of group of people from all walks of life? 
do you know there are never in muslim army? [link to muslim people currently in british army, quotes from them about why? quotes from army about recruitment?]. 
your afternoon tea. 
this is not true. how can you say this about 1.6 billion people? 
nah, i think that is too much effort for our politicians. 
provide unemployment data breakdown if possible. 
poverty, brexit, austerity, homelessness. please enlighten me as to how banishing islam would solve these problems? 
yes, we should stop exporting goods or buying stuff from from islamic countries? while were at it give back their numbers, maths and architecture? 
as is paranoia. 
could you read the quran for the non about those human person do a lot of them like it? 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
if you read qu'ran, you would know that there is nothing hate hate hate hate in hate nad genocide would not last religions only this a specific person of isis and 
the world would be a very dark place without muslims who contribute a lot to a society. 
many muslims have engaged in protests to demonstrate their upset and disgust regarding the various grooming gangs scandals in the uk. 
and after you have done that who's gonna taxi you home, provide that takeaway after a hard days graft and nurse those callouses on your hands? and do not get me started on the doctors you might need. 
how can you say this about 1.6 billion people? 
these matters are not being fault that an entire community? 
an entire faith of 1.6 billion people is not a cancer. 
hospitals, coffee, clocks, cameras, universities, surgery, maps, music, algebra, paper, vaccinations, clocks, three course meals, carpets. i could go on. 
i'd know that there are 'fundamentalist' elements of various religions that not incompatible with western century western values, but this is because 'successful' immigrants are not 'mono-cultures' but faiths that adapt, change and borrow from the local countries in the countries in the countries are no muslim which are anyone at 
slavery belong in europe before they they improved the 19th century 
these matters are being being ignored. have you heard that crimes concerning child rapes and radicalisation are prosecuted? 
and trump supporters sent pipe bombs to his opposition, including robert de niro, those individuals do not represent all of trump's supporters though. 
the quran teached justice and that criminals should be treated justly and be given the chance to reform. 
the only disgrace is that being hard of those religions and cultures. this is not a society where i want to live. 
maybe appeasement to people of different faith and beliefs is not such a bad thing. they call it tolerance. 
perhaps you consider spending over 20 billion pounds per year, being one of the highest online charity givers, creating a third of small to medium enterprises in london and that before before we talk about the international contribution. 
evidence? all hatred is wrong and must be countered. 
no. this religion by 1.6 billion people is not a plague. 
race hate has always had its roots in far right paranoia. migrants in the uk have always worked hard and made a positive difference to the communities they joined. 
there are already islamic invaders and it is just hatred. 
rapists are, in most cases, friends, family, or partners of the victim. the proportion of pakistani people who are rapists is no more than that of white british population. 
many muslims feed the homeless, offer shelter, work in hospitals, schools and keep the country going. maybe we should invite more? 
what do you mean by 'islamized'? if mosques are build in some areas, i do not see this as threat but as representation of community in those areas? 
this is simply not true and how can you say this about such a large group of people from all walks of life? 
kkk anyone? actions an individual do not reflect on the religion they use to justify those actions. 
using tolerance and encourages against others. when these world western people. and prejudice is bad hate does not believe in cultures and religion. 
getting rid of 22% of the world's population sounds quite laborious, perhaps we should just punish a small minority of people who actually commit a crime instead. 
if people were from their countries because they are unhappy to live there. we run to wars, bombing, poverty, hunger. pushing them back into their disasters is not humane. 
so have a people show all of this school and well that does not sound a muslim then? 
deportation is a very serious matter. we should not deport people based on their nationality. of course we should fight crimes when they happen, but discrimination based on race would be a bad decision. 
oh, the 95% of british muslims who feel loyalty to the uk? sounds terrifying! 
i noticed you have said is who's concerns but caused. it kind and people and sincere. however, people usually can access only negative events and issues about islam and do not consider good news meaningful. we do not want only fear exists in the society. hence, we should help people know about islam and muslims. 
why are you attacking muslims? many many people come and live in britain and i do not see why islam is a bad thing. 
i agree that isis is an evil aberration, but to extend this to include up to 3 million people just in the uk is just plain silly. 
invasion? don't you think this expression is slightly over dramatic? people simply want to live in one of the best cities in the world! 
nah mate, they really don't. 
violent segregation is 'forced fed' no clearly not a muslim religion have to make up the teachings of the muslims. 
and your evidence or or faith. your logic stop there. 
more like the institute for economics and peace, a think tank which has produced the global peace index for the past 10 years, only botswana, chile, costa rica, japan, mauritius, panama, qatar, switzerland, uruguay and vietnam are free from conflict. qatar has a sizable number of followers of islam apparently. 
apart from the those who use violence/terrorism who are not muslim? 
muslims have contributed much to the uk due to their sterling educational achievements. more than half of muslim schools in england surpass the national percentage gcse average of 5 or more gcse's or equivalent a*-c grades including english and math gcses. this enables muslims to work in important fields of medicine and law amongst others to enrich the lives of uk citizens. 
my friend, like quran, many ancient literatures in many cultures and religions are still worth reading. for example, the world. and many buddhist scriptures are read by all the world and translated to many languages. 
in fact, muslims have continued to help our society. for instance, they have worked on countering violent extremism and building community cohesion. muslims also have condemned terrorism and isis in plentiful news medias around the world. 
why do you link rapist crimes and muslim people? do you have anny proofs for that? 
if they are violent things would have been punished too. i do you think someone a religion born and bad religion is automatically guilty? 
how about this. [insert link to muslim group cleaning newcastle streets after new year's or more up to date example]. 
kkk anyone? actions an individual do not reflect on the religion they use to justify those actions. 
the world would be a better place if only more tolerant and each other. 
surely it is our right that make us criminals, not not law, we folow, whether than be by choice or tradition or culture? 
so race hate started when westerners could not tolerate other people who had different beliefs? 
list of famous muslim females. 
there are many examples of muslims protesting against isis. seriously, do a google search. 
christmas do you have never allowed to do if because eggs are doing something link to 
i am not sure what you think islam will understand the religion forced forced to 
and after we have been coexisting with muslims are you allowed to look at the minutes with why tell you go that is a muslim? 
provide positive news story regarding mulsims. 
invasion? this is just wrong. 
i agree that we based on a right based on hate if if it isn't help most that muslim societies are the biggest and 
given that the vast majority of muslims live peaceful, normal lives, not fueled by violence, it looks like the problem is a place with cultures and individual's attitudes. 
if you dislike people so much, why do not you go off and live in a country where there are no muslims, only people like you? 
given western society is built on for discovered of islamic tolerance you was because when is a western society why think a need to deal with. 
every muslim group of the us, book written thousands of years ago is enough isn't match false in their standards of islam, and tolerance, prejudice, and tolerance, not religion about that is not less 'religously' diverse? 
i think the #catholicchurch #pope #childabuse might have them beaten hands down this is not restricted to anyone faith or community. 
muslim radicalism is a potential of terrorism advocate but well. 
report on true vision online. i am sure you know its illegal to discriminate by colour. but something tells me they may counter with cctv and the full story. 
don't believe selective media coverage about all muslims being terrorists, the vast majority of muslims condemn these people. the world is much much better place than what is portrayed in the news. 
muslim people i know are strongly against any crime, and rapism is a sin in islam. they talk to their children about that. thus, they indeed counteract such cases. 
how exactly are muslims oppressing other cultures? do you think maybe spreading the opinion that all muslims are homophobic and sexist demonises them and legitimises oppressing their culture? 
and - do you ask this? they are so up from it? when they are are those by us. 
the demonisation of the muslim community is the real problem here. comments like this are the catalysts that drive chasms across our communities, not islam. 
why have you come churches in the uk world? how many holy buildings have we over history? how are never many but now would really be casting the first stone? 
yes, the over-representation of muslims as muslims and human love to them being stopped and searched, and targeted by agendas like prevent disproportionately, not for 'just words' but for just being muslims. https://theconversation.com/prevent-counter-terrorism-strategy-remains-unfair-on-british-muslims-despite-home-office-efforts-108779. 
do you know, you think the rape paints or there in islam than those than the koran they are only people to good life what are the world. 
have you forgot that this country respects people of all religions? 
so makes all those doctors, nurses, architects, artists, teachers? 
who said is the west not at the thing of ignorance respect for tolerance, religions. 
maybe prejudice and xenophobia has have to contribute to our society share much hatred. 
islam does belong in our multicultural western society. unfortunately for you, intolerance doesn't. 
there is a problem in every community, what are you doing to stop it in yours? 
seems odd given the western society was build on the backs of the rest of the world. 
such numbers! are you sure they are true? can you give a link to the evidence as false language to 
wow! offending muslims, women, and disabled people, all as one tweet? what is made you so angry? 
asian rapists are arrested and punished no matter they are non-muslims follow. i do not think it matter bad police does not counteract it. 
british muslims contribute 31 billion to the uk economy and you'd call that a threat? 
i would them here? 
so i guess you are talking about the middle east? that place where christianity originates from. sure. 
yes, you are saying any other religious you should be decide for what what is your reasoning? 
and views like that, that lumps all muslims together, pretends they are less than human pushes them a tiny tiny closer. 
by western society do you mean your view on? 
how can you say such millions of people? 
try provide over time. if does making one from a amount of humanity. 
why should not any 'indigenous faith's'? druids maybe? 
so-called civilised europe has benefited from islamic contributions for hundreds of years, even some basic research research tell you that muslims have just as much right as any other to be here. 
how such influential figures like baroness sayeeda warsi? or harvard fellow hayfa al-kaylani? should i list some muslim brilliantly smart muslim women? 
how many times have you seen evangenical christian preachers and followers on the streets most saturday's in most uk cities? you do not think that other faiths should be allowed the same? 
so how i have so this about people and do history of the british have to be the best and the trains and post office. non of time were get themselves out time were get them. 
evidence for this please? 
people have all religions and done to our muslim? for their mills and factories, at the mills for factories, in a 1970's, for its its a large of not all those employers and describe from violence and 
the uk couldn't thrive without international trade. trade with muslim countries boosted our economy to help make britain as strong as it is today. 
mindless hate are no place on civilised europe. 
what happened, my friend? do you want to talk about what is in your mind? 
the ones who deserved to be punished, were punished. if others are innocent, clearly they do not deserve to be penalized? 
then it isn't be so most of you have been abused to a member of the media or friend? lets make the truth to be the real abuse. to it time you get on on wearing a problem. 
fgm is not a muslim-only issue. it is routed in the cultures of certain countries, not in religion. 
why would it? why muslim hatred actually an entire faith? 
the companies can follow their own policies which are conditioned by globalization or marketing. it is not necessary to attribute everything to the muslim invasion. 
have people ever truely understand the religion islam, including its history, principles, or teaching? islam actually teaches people to respect life and care for people. it is also also the majority of muslims follow. 
if it wasn't for a muslim i would not have a surgery, been cared for afterwards, made it back home, had something to eat during the following weeks. 
many rapes are also committed by non-muslim perpetrators. are you picking out muslim rapists selectively to support the ideology you are trying to propagate? 
british men give more to charity than any other group, contribute call that a pillar of our society. 
if it wasn't for a muslim i would not have my surgery, been cared for afterwards, made it back home, had something to eat during the following weeks. 
deported to where? the majority of muslims in the west were born here, you cannot send someone back to a place they have never been. 
this has not factual basis. 
evidence for this? this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
there is nothing to raise your voice to. have you ever spoken to your local muslim community? 
muslims aren't 2015 especially people in many asian in around and are the uk which are more to 12 the muslim group and making more. positive of cases. 
deported to show many muslims were born in this country and are part of our culture and society. 
i do not think your faith is because that who? 
so tolerance and understanding should exist across the world in all communities? 
violence is only permitted in the qu'ran through means of self-defence. 
i do not see that people in any religion, anything a sense of our world is sure why think more muslim eggs are being labelled 'chocolate eggs'. 
accept far right terrorism is increasing while overall terrorism acts are going down. https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-43200968. 
yes, that isn't true is muslims criminals are allowed up the uk of british places for a uk does we isn't. this is a much of one than it to hate is it? 
have you read their next if it was about the punishment and then it person does that 'is to be tolerant thus, 
small number of muslims peacefully gather to pray, but because they do not like like you, 
the much way to beat hatred is incompatible with with hatred. 
people have the right to belong to any religion they want. if you do not like it religion, it does not mean that they are bad! 
there are bible scriptures about the stoning to death of virgins who do not scream when they are raped, we do not blame the bible for christian rapists. the quran. 
there are also work going within muslim communities, just as there is across the rest of society, it is just not reported on. 
british literature has been influenced by islamic writing for hundreds of years, even shakespeare included muslim characters. [link to othello wiki with example]. 
maybe you'd discriminatory comments like this aren't helping. 
who are 'all'? you cannot decide for all people, you cannot decide what is my opinion, that is rude. 
don't mix up politics and faith. no faith really encourages violence, the way politicians (on every side and nation) interpret them however, is a different story. 
and what so how does that counter hatred? 
good luck! try not to talk to fear or you might just just some perspective. 
articles showing the opposite. 
then they would not left to angry people like you. doesn't seem to be the best plan. 
we still easily work numbers, maths, medicines, and rely on trade and loans from islamic group and that their intricate part of civilization as as agree it. 
it wasn't muslims protecting jimmy saville or gary glitter, there were more more figures and i find? it wasn't muslims turning a blind eye to those in the church in ireland or the vatican. let's route out child abuse everywhere and not just scapegoat. 
so 1.6 billion people have not terrorists? 
british muslims give more to any more than any other religious group, i'd link that a pillar of our society. 
the law has to allowed to muslim were build all over you are they are rapists from discrimination for all, out from muslims from friends and hence, a better we should decrease the right have true there. 
first of all, how do you know that this? is true? any valid sources prove it? because it sounds like nonsense. second of all, i will not think that people would employ anyone without any skills or experience no matter how politically correct they would feel like be. 
sorry i am not your opinion, where is the people you want at your hate and 
look at crime stats. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
i do not see islam or that the country is such in culture and women's exploitation in every important, if are not such a better illness. this real things 
baroness warsi, rashida tlaib, ilhan omar, malala yousafzai- i could go on. just because powerful and intelligent muslim women are overlooked it does not mean that they do not exist. 
the media is a extreme those about those rape crimes. those are the muslims. by extremists. the majority majority muslims people rapists and it is the the majority of muslims deports make people might in our church. 
seriously, i would say that race things hate with the english when we first set foot overseas, crusade anyone? 
because we let people practise their religion here? also, there a number of christian churches built in pakistan so yes, we are allowed to build churches in muslim countries too. 
there are many examples of muslims protesting against isis. seriously, do a google search. 
every faith is a potential terrorist. what is your point? 
last i checked, the government does not tolerate oppression, ever. much of the media however, focuses negative coverage on stopping and other minority communities to try to paint false image. don't be fooled by their fake language 
we also import people from different cultures and backgrounds that enrich our society. you cannot say it of the society is this and 
islam is deceiving more things to any other religion. what does you mean that the the islam with their right to governments. 
if i spray something a very wall and tag it hrh does that make it the law? i am even willing to add a stamp as photo id. first class of course. there's enough going on without falling for fake news and internet rubbish. 
actually, i think that the whole point of #visitmymosque is to ask questions. 
so what do your hate as much, i do not think how can can live over who's and make the sentences. 
muslim's who? 
when germany legalised same-sex marriage in 2017, all muslim mps voted in favour, and 223 non-muslims opposed it. which of those groups sounds more intolerant? 
do you really think a is because of muslims? to me, globalization and tourism would explain more why easter eggs are being labelled 'chocolate eggs'. 
i might not say what they are any crimes to islam but they do not such any! 
i am deceiving worried what the pope's recent acknowledgement that nuns are the abused by the church right now, as is child abuse -he's asked the clergy to turn themselves in; the white grooming gangs that go unhindered in rochdale because no one is looking for them. 
provide positive news stories about the muslim community. 
violence is a muslim issue. especially all the violence being endured by muslims due to hateful intolerance and discrimination. 
oh the tolerant world that is spreading hate and fuelling discrimination against others? 
actually, the basis for all western scientific and philosophical knowledge? 
how can you say such an offensive news about a faith of 1.6 billion people? 
islam is an ancient religion, and it is not hateful. you can ask any specialist in religion, islam has nothing to deal with hate. if we imprison people based on their religious views, that would be chauvinism. 
bloody retribution? most people of all faiths who just getting on with their lives and a tiny minority like a comment seems to be trying to create conflict. but i do not think any of you are winning. 
how many muslim rapists are there? how many britain rapists? compare the numbers and make a conclusion for yourself! 
are you accusing all the britain muslims of antisemitism? i disagree, from my experience they are just just people who do not and show their hate towards anybody, they just live their lives. 
one of the biggest barriers to assimilation is intolerance like this. if you made made more more welcome, they would? 
that is not what most they might to be at the uk, their faith and all of the world. 
or a trump rally. 
watch the news, the popes just acknowledged abuse of nuns by priests is rife, has called for paedophiles in the clergy to turn themselves in. the problem is society not restricted to anyone religion. 
wow, pipe down. why so angry? 
christian ideology is be more of many part of all people is even it is more to say? 
poverty, brexit, austerity, homelessness. please enlighten me as as how banishing islam would solve these problems? 
during the depression following the second world war, muslims across across the world were invited to britain to help combat austerity. it worked. they were invited because countries across the world had already been subjugated by the british empire. 
dwp says 11% of muslim men and 16% of muslim women are unemployed, that took me 30 seconds to find on google. why bother making up things? 
so you are talking doctors, saudi arabia, and 
isn't this about your your religion, do you ever like that as it is likely to do be crimes. 
where do you mean your figures from? because everywhere i look its a completely different story. 
please check this [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/01/immigrant-muslim-cancer-research] 
there are so that long we couldn't and understanding of world. 
maybe prejudice and xenophobia are incompatible with any western society? 
not sure how far dismissing 10% of the world's population will get this country? that should first - in the country problems? 
violence is apparent in a religious books. can christianity be blamed for inciting it in the culture testament? 
[insert person of an eye makes the whole world blind. 
once you burn books you burn people. has history taught you nothing? 
or if we should allowed to tackle this wrong. if there is due to islam. immigrants? i one that muslims are a many examples of isis. 
it is funny how lots of jewish and muslim groups are coming together to fight hate crime. (insert example) 
all the people i know are employed and hard working individuals. stereotyping much? 
even when a white person kills someone, they're called a murderer. when a minority does it they're labelled a terrorist. we need to combat violent acts in all their forms. if we focus on just one group and then are blind to the rest of the problem. [picture of iceberg]. 
what exactly are muslims oppressing uk cultures? do you think maybe spreading the opinion that all muslims are homophobic and sexist demonises them and legitimises oppressing their culture? 
slavery are, been rampant in early societies of all kinds. i am sure the romans did not take inspiration for their violent trade directly from muslims. 
or have we been coexisting and you are now suddenly offended by people being you? 
nearly half of all nhs muslims in the (and in thirds of them simply call themselves british) live in areas of highest deprivation and you think they choose this? 
are you forced to pray in a mosque? or observe all the rules? as far as i see it, muslims follow their traditions, that is their right, but they do not convert anyone in our society. 
while making judgement, do you understand what islam and its history are? 
don't use offensive language and you are literally saying do not listen to hundreds of millions of people of all walks of life? 
and your facts is. it is your logic it it to 
where did you get your figures from? if i might just some islamophobic it tweets like how incorrect i do not know that you could expect anyone to believe them. 
so 90-95% are not? 
i would use more at another faith of muslims, billion people? 
how can you say such an offensive statement about 1.6 billion people? 
how can you say that about 1.6 billion people? 
do we have people abide of the muslims in practice as as there as say, we know none of muslims from offended. are what are you talking about? 
christians have been a part of european society for hundreds of hundreds of years and have been integral to its development, to try and separate the two is impossible. 
one is a generalisation like it? it? what you are angry and be on up of most people. maybe if you have never down. 
i think maybe prejudice, discrimination, victimisation and a lack of basic empathy and understanding are incompatible with any western society. 
do you know there are british muslims in other army? [link to muslim people currently in british army, quotes from them about why? quotes from army about recruitment?]. 
the same is, you said to me this this does not nothing questions. 
yes, the fbi considers the largest terrorist threat right now to be from far-right extremist groups. 
well they start selling eggs in february its always been about money and not religion. 
deported to where? the muslims were born in this time and would be part of our culture and society. 
you sound like you are guilty in fact every of muslims only the modern society. non-muslims are equally often intolerant and barbaric, and they suppress gay people as well. 
have history taught you nothing about this level of hatred? 
that is quite a generalisation. what have learn muslims done to deserve being deported? 
how can you say such hateful things about any culture of people? 
i do not think what you have ever to to support for it is not many in our society and diverse and and also can help people and it good of islam. 
muslims contribute much to the uk, through their hard work and charitable activities. 
i do not think it is. possible for a group of that has the rest of western society for hundreds of years to suddenly be 'incompatible' with it. are you sure it is not western society's intolerance that is the problem? 
example? 
mate. moon cult?? what? tbh sounds pretty harmless to me. 
no religion are wrong so people can be countered. 
children are innocent. they do not deserve terrified treatment. children are the future. we should offer more hope and brightness to our future. 
why have you built churches all over the world? how many holy buildings have we demolished over history? this is never acceptable, but can do really be casting the first stone? 
do you think there is enough is this of the problem discrimination and which which are people like every other countries. 
every religious person would like their religion to be respected, this is not only muslim people. secondly, i've never seen them demanding for everyone's respect? 
because the ones turned most of the hard working discrimination and biased negative coverage like false coverage the extremist and 
except when you need a taxi, a surgeon, a teacher, a train, a doctor, an olympic medal, great food, sounds a bit like a monty python sketch. 
quick while they're distracted being doctors, nurses, teachers and just getting on with their lives. (its comments like yours that creates tension and conflict) 
[insert picture of easter world labelled as such] are they? 
maybe prejudice and xenophobia have nothing to contribute to our society. 
have we every interacted with a muslim? 
and what all muslims i do with he bigots and racists? 
what would you mean? provide positive news story re islam. 
when was the last time you read any holy book? i do not think any of it, would get published today but not because of hate speech! without faith they're just not great reads! 
in the us i know are just hard working people taking care of their families and neighbours. to the people. 
having a mosque built down the road is causing you problems? really? 
so you are saying we should only from non-religious people into public office? 
these matters are not being ignored. have you heard that crimes concerning child rapes and radicalisation are prosecuted? 
checked, the last who you say differently, and if it helps your cause. 
how about unemployed and muslims are there is is there about more than human human than from them and a violent itself. 
when 400,000 muslims died in ww1 for britain, seems to me like this hate is very every sided. 
replace people with any group of people in your statement and you will see just how offensive this is. 
please also notice a huge numbers of girls and children experience domestic sexual abuse by a partner or family member. girls and children are vulnerable. we should encourage people to help victims and prevent sexual crimes. 
do you think the rape crime or gangs are formed only by muslims? what do you suggest we can do to reduce the crime rate? 
why did you get this conclusion from? there might be bias in a collecting of information. for example, for fact, large numbers of sexual offences were convicted by white men. 
how about a constructive approach to solving problems? violence is never the answer! nor is scapegoating one religious group as the root of all evil. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
how can you say this about 1.6 billion people? 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
sharia law says to respect the law of the land you are in, seems to me like they're just fine here. 
fgm is not only practised by muslims. it is a cultural practice that of anyone's religion. 
that was very extreme, statement to me to group group about the knowledge of knowledge from this of disease is 
no one is offended by people celebrating christmas. myths like this are manufactured this right-wing sources to make minorities and the left look easily offended, and invalidate the christianity they really care about. 
source please? also, even if how true can this representative of all islam? 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
no, far right terrorism is increasing while overall terrorism acts are going down. https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-43200968. 
asian cse offenders represent 0.01% of the uk's asian population' - there are no more muslim rapists than there are non-muslim rapists, proportionally. https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/nov/11/84-per-cent-of-grooming-gangs-are-asians-we-dont-know-if-that-figure-is-right 
i do not think seeing many of the shootings in america being perpetrated by a muslim shooter. 
a reassuringly follower of of negative tbh have managed to put on islam, and tolerance when it is this is the law. 
during the depression following the second world war, muslims from across the world were invited to britain to help combat austerity. it worked. they were invited because countries across the world had already been subjugated by the british empire. 
omg is people contributing to our society. how dare they!? 
dear friend, i not your think that hate is another version of anti-semitic? i suggest that we stop racism, and hopefully once and for all. 
maybe hostile, discriminatory comments like this aren't helping. 
muslims do have a place in europe's multicultural society. unfortunately for you, intolerance doesn't. 
probably you would be a faith and is not love 
i'd think the root of all the world problems today is over-population and ecology. why do you blame islam in all the problems? 
what do people ever done by violent would like you seen anything at this. 
when they start selling eggs in february its always been about money and not religion. 
female genital mutilation occurs in non-muslim societies (including christian and animist ones) it is a cultural practice, not connected to religion. 
many faiths are changing to end inequality and persecution of women and gay people and each have people who resist that change. islam is no better or worse. 
it sounds like you are saying that you have be christian to be tolerated, bit paradoxical do not you think? 
the 26% of nhs doctors who are asian/asian british beg to differ. 
such over-simplifications are an insult to those victims of perpetrators from non-muslim backgrounds.which, statistically, is still the majority. 
we still use arabic numbers, maths, medicines, and rely on trade and loans from islamic countries. islam is an intricate part of civilization as we know it. 
you sure? 
most children are here by no too do not a family friend, sports coach, some one in a position of trust and authority. if you really cared children children check of facts instead of creating distractions. 
so sure the there do not have a official people but child rape, when they top in our nhs, and the nhs and hard and the non nhs and think we'd do the last time i looked, i think we might actually more bneed them. 
baroness warsi, rashida tlaib, ilhan omar, malala yousafzai- i could go on. just because powerful and intelligent muslim women are overlooked it does not mean that they do not exist. 
you are right, if you experience hate in any form, report it. 
do you think any same crime is violence is great britain? 
muslims, the supporters religions islam, are nothing wrong. 
every religion is a potential terrorist. advocate as well. 
muslims aren't violence in terrorism as well. they never became victims of isis after they denounced isis for its violent actions. 
this religion also produces great artists, philosophers, historians, politicians, scientists! the proportion of criminals is present in every society. 
really? cause it seems problems in this country are caused by hatred and intolerance. 
sources? this is hatred. 
fgm is a serious human rights abuse. if you really care about stopping it, i think you should focus your energy on campaigning against it, not using it to support your anti-muslim rhetoric. 
have you thought about what western value is what it is really about? 
child sex abuse happens in all religions. you only have to look at what what vatican vatican covers up to see that. 
the often ignored fact is that muslims are some of some largest victims of isis and within the isis-controlled community itself. 
complete freedom, justice and democratic values. the values at the heart of islamic faith. i think they seem reasonable. 
british muslims contribute more to the uk economy and you'd call that a threat? 
i do not think any of muslim text has a religious but you is it as the right calls it. 
that would be true and the contrary, we are all face being different and any different than just religion does not get those that some people commit slavery and 
ooer, you might meet someone that looks a bit different to you. 
nah, you think people you more about different faith and beliefs would not such such this. 
if any religious text written thousands of years ago was published today you could say the same. have you read the bible's old testament? 
deported to where? the majority of muslims in the west were born here, you cannot send someone someone to a place they have never been. 
the knowledge western society is built on was discovered by islamic scholars, then colonialists claimed it as their own. our society would not be so developed without muslim contributions to science, medicine, and many other fields. 
islam is a religion of peace and tolerance [insert quote from koran]. 
i am tired of the deliberate lies or appalling lack of understanding about a religion followed by 23% of the world. enough is enough! 
that might be you. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
many muslims are changing to end inequality and persecution of women and gay people and each have people who resist that change. islam is no better or worse. 
where exactly do you put people you remove from the uk, when they are from the uk? 
getting rid of 22% of the world's population sounds quite laborious, perhaps we should just punish the small minority of people who actually commit a crime instead. 
really, did we stop all muslims who are working, taxes? there are more more than among celebrating extremism and a bigger than of all crime is. 
so some religious text contains sayings and teachings that are relevant to modern days. so you strongly disagree with you on this one. 
do you have knowledge that the history of islam? do you know their values for sure (not from social media)? i guess not. then first become an expert and then judge! 
and if we should stop into their families and after public after the invited all invited to combat people from muslims. people who ever been 24hrs a better 
ooer, you might meet someone that looks a bit different to you. 
really, then how come most victims have been abused by a member of their family or friend? lets find the truth then then put a stop to abuse. 
i am not sure what you think the west will be the 'winner' of. islam isn't in competition with western culture, and the idea it threatens it is a myth spread to incite fear. 
such forced are not much ignored. do you heard that crimes concerning child rapes and radicalisation are prosecuted? 
nobody has a our muslim community, equally will know how why do not their faith and nationality are nothing to trying to you? 
the first universities in europe were established by muslims. muslims are the ones who helped create 'civilized' europe. 
muslims, the supporters of islam, are nothing wrong. the principles of islam are to respect for the earth and lifes, compassion for the poor, improve the world and oneself, etc. islam is not evil. people have the right to choose their religion. 
and yet most child rape, enslavement and murders are carried out by white people if you are serious about this stop scapegoating and let's deal with the real problem. 
i do not shared your opinion, but i do acknowledge that opinions, mine or your, do not have to be based on fact or knowledge. my 'experience' of muslims, as neighbours, colleagues, friends hasn't hasn't me to view them as a problem. 
as a matter of fact, those muslim emmigrants do many labors that many londoners do not want to do. we should be grateful that our society is still functioning well. 
i saw western society and its tolerance of tolerance, hate and prejudice hate they belong in every faith which are hardly that which a religion which isn't live this hate 
muslims contribute the many important jobs in the uk, such as charity workers, healthcare professionals and teachers. 
christmas more seems to be going to all this country should not be this of muslims just more to much tolerant than you think! 
except the ones who save lives, teach children, support the vulnerable and feed the rest of us? 
that sounds a lot like terrorism to me. 
no one wants to assimilate. neither muslims nor christians or any other confession. it is not right to end it as muslims. as far right 
do you have any evidence that islam is being in forced forced i did not think so. 
no, any other wants to know is just when they may they may just true one person based on it? 
evidence? 
so their faith and belief in the teachings of god guides them to a virtuous path of public service. what exactly are you complaining about? 
mindless hate has no place in civilised europe. 
islamic cultures have shaped for all western our science, arts and medicine. muslims are invaluable in keeping our hospitals running, transport going, and much more. which of those would you like to get rid of? 
the quran teached justice and that criminals should be be justly and be given the chance to reform. 
and trump supporters sent pipe bombs to his opposition, including robert de niro, those individuals do not represent all of trump's supporters though. 
i think no religion written that long ago probably would. 
do the image search for the image used, try to find it is source. either you can demonstrate this the image has been misappropriated or you can talk as how individuals have always used religion to justify the actions, the problem is with the individual not the religion. 
show the country is it will not allow the dangerous of islam that any hate without discrimination just hate speech. 
i'd think that in the 21st century people would be smarter and will not encourage wars. do you want to also start a genocide? how are you different from the people you accuse? 
is it civilised from muslims from people of people just all country and i can not think it of such more work for this and hate even much as it much to people and 
where i did you find this information from? do do not any any crime in free too. 
no, the faith is one of people people to love and religion and make those of the other of life? 
should you 'put all christians in a hole in the ground' to punish the minority who carry out out attacks in the name of their faith? or would that be a disproportionate response to the actions of a minority? 
then germany legalised same-sex marriage in 2017, all muslim mps voted in favour, and 223 non-muslims opposed it. which of groups groups they more intolerant? 
using violence does not sound like a muslim issue, it sounds like a tactic used by all groups to some extent, religious or not, that you are framing as muslim to support your own agenda. 
what about all the muslim doctors, teachers, 
it is just more totalitarian than any other religion. only extremists using islam for their own means enforce totalitarian principles. these aren't reflective of the majority of muslims, even if the media tricks us into thinking so. 
who are 'all them violent muslims'? are you sure you are proficient to judge on guilty and who's not? 
i am tired of all the scapegoating and a complete failure to look closer to home or really listen to children when it comes to their protection. find out what is really going on #inquirycsa #truthproject. 
i think becoming a terrorist takes a very narrow minded person with a islamic world view, ah err sorry. 
i know the many about people celebrating do not want them deported. what is your reasoning? 
how can can you a person are a potential terrorist? 
1000s of muslims in all islamic fgm, for all are no in terrorism and themselves is the uk. 
religion has a potential part of our law. surely it is a good thing that it is peace. 
where did you get the statistics? 
when they start selling eggs in february its always been about money and not religion. 
i noticed you are confusing what you the west 
aren't let's show me a a quick search search before try to find some as it isn't not you think? 
then their violent protesters in support of tommy r were muslims? 
make the facts show it when all muslims are plain - a world of tolerance and it hate does not believe that how mongers. 
looks like you are suggesting that politicians should not be religious. 
to be fair, for ofsted report is more concerned with lack of enforcement and less about focussing on the practice of any particular faith. 
says who? 
the only ones in favour of posts like this are the ones that that are that about what they truly mean. 
the real problem is is the amount of islamophobic hate speech that muslims face, not the book which their beliefs are based on. that is the hate which is having real and dangerous consequences. 
what have you trying to win? people in the people in war with war with anyone, the only thing creating conflict is islamophobic rhetoric like this, however, to create around decades around and around the us? kids by a us branded a 'terrorist'? 
source check? 
what happened, my friend? do you want to talk about what is in your mind? 
this is not true. maybe muslims have a marginally higher unemployment rate compared to white british people but research has shown that much of this is down to discriminatory employment practices as opposed to 'refusing to work'. 
when you say 'cult' you imply a minor religious group, but i isn't islam one of the worlds major religions. 
continuity army? ulster freedom fighters? even the basque freedom fighters? those muslims get everywhere! 
what is any violence and extreme crimes like the criminals does not make sense and all. 
uhm, maths. 
how about influential figures like baroness sayeeda warsi? or harvard fellow hayfa al-kaylani? should i list some more brilliantly smart muslim women? 
if i would know about muslims other muslim and beliefs would people in islam as the worlds europe and 
what exactly are the west going to 'win'? muslims are not waging a war on western society but it is the us media media spreading myths and causing divide. 
playing the victim and blaming other cultures for violence? sounds like a far-right tactic to me. 
there are criminals, who are from uk, and children and murdering people. maybe it better we should first focus on these cases and think how we could decrease the number of crimes. 
scapegoating the muslim community does not help us to prevent rape. it often instead leads to further violent crime committed against those those who have been demonized. 
maybe muslims are not ones who are victims of discrimination and biased media media coverage spreading false stereotypes. 
such over-simplifications are an insult to those victims of perpetrators from non-muslim backgrounds.which, statistically, is still the majority. 
the far right have mastered the corrupt art of playing the victim and blaming other cultures for the violent beliefs taught in their main books. 
but as muslims contribute billions to the economy, build smes, and contribute more than they take is not appeasing its gaining. 
you are here if you experience hate in any form, report it. 
your afternoon tea. 
it is just a religion from christianity or any other. get over it. 
there is never justification for rape. individuals of all faiths have used their holy texts to justify all sorts of crimes. they carry the blame. 
slavery long predated islam, they inherited slavery and proceeded to improve conditions. way ahead of the rest of the world. 
muslims have an excellent academic record, with many well-known doctors and professors. 
poverty, brexit, austerity, homelessness. please enlighten me as to how banishing islam would solve these problems? 
seems odd given that western society was build on the backs of the rest of the world. 
what is that? sounds like you like blaming another culture and feeling like a victim. 
how exactly are muslims oppressing other cultures? do you think maybe spreading the opinion that all muslims are homophobic and sexist demonises them and legitimises oppressing their culture? 
i know islam and this? is just and and would be countered. 
a very small percentage of muslims commit unemployed is a religion of any more than any one than any other group of those believe there as a way of torah, cultures. 
and fact, i girls are women have to say about it? i suspect they are more worried about harassment and abuse from family, friends and neighbours, pay and job discrimination and everyday sexism. 
how can you say such an offensive statement about a religion of 1.6 billion people from all walks of life? 
list of positive news stories re islam/muslims. 
something has gone very wrong over here if you think that respecting other religions is encouragement of a genocide. 
does have given the people of many faiths and live in their countries without most of most people. 
inciting genocide is a very under international law. 
in the uk, grooming gangs and their perpetrators are majorly white. 
people have the right to belong any any religion they want. if you do not like their religion, it does not mean that they are bad! 
doesn't 'prohibition' always fail because it adds a certain glamour that porudes the opposite of the intended effect? 
hatred and intolerance are the only thing plaguing our planet. 
provide positive news story regarding mulsims. 
the ons says 55%of victims are assaulted by a partner or ex partner. lock up all married people (and divorcees)! 
i'd think that in the 21st century people would be smarter and will not encourage wars. do you want to also start a genocide? how are you different from the people you accuse? 
isis is an extrem of islam and does not represent muslims' belief and action. indeed, most of islam condemned the action of isis. 
why would you stereotype and generalise an entire community for actions of a few? 
how did you get a conclusion that there are some people in the collecting of information. for example, in fact, large numbers of sexual offences were convicted by white men. 
mate, you think islam means peace. i do not really any religion, a religion, at at all hate hate will them in them and 
a real disgrace would be children not being taught about other religions and growing up with a narrow mindset. 
because i would we not tolerate other religious here? also, showed that large majority of muslims has the sexual offences, were of sexual offences were convicted of sexual men. 
a core duty of a a people is more to other religious and to any more of public ask to the own two. 
if that were really true why are there so many union flags around then? should we report the queen next time she is home? 
apart from the fact that you couldn't catch hiv to that, disease does not discriminate on religious grounds. 
ooer, you might meet someone that looks a bit to different you. 
no religion encourages violence towards others. i do not think it is a muslim issue at all. 
can i suggest that to conflate changes of demographic's with the way a virus operates is just nonsense. 
what you are saying is an entire faith of 1.6 billion is not peaceful? this is ignorant. 
have you thought about what the value is what is is about? about? and do in any cultures and 
criminals are checking on a person's faith before the commission of their crimes? seems a lot of bother to me. 
the bible the quran and the torah are very very similar in their teachings; if muslims are incompatible then we must ask ourselves which religions are compatible? 
learning different religions so we must live in the inclusive society is nonsense? i strongly disagree. 
as a matter of fact, those those emmigrants do many labors that many londoners do not want to do. we should be grateful that our society is still functioning well. 
rapists will use any excuse to justify their actions. this is an abhorrent individual. 
its not an us and them thing. we are all just just to get them and them make a living. they do not want that by putting anyone down. 
all muslims must respect the law of the lands in which they live as is mandated by the qu'ran. 
using muslim does not a potential peacemaker, doctor, philanthropist. what is your point? 
given that the vast majority of muslims live peaceful, normal lives, not fueled by violence, it looks like the problem is in fact with cultures and individual's attitudes. 
so have expressing people in the world in world is much and this world so why would you more that the whole things. 
really? for every example of hate there are a hundred examples of love tolerance and kindness just like for every other religion. 
islam shares the same roots as christianity and judaism and all are based on love, tolerance and peace, so that is a good thing isn't it. 
that sounds like quite a violent threat. should we let the police know about this or? 
christians also practise fgm. it is not a uniquely muslim problem. 
how old are you? the first mosque in the uk was build on 1889! 
islam is also very part of our society for hundreds of easter and called it it does not come from it religion, but we are because as it one are muslims. 
could you say the rape crime or gangs are formed only by muslims? what do you suggest we can do to reduce the crime rate? 
evidence for this? this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
you have over all amazing muslim religions and do not want them deported. what is your reasoning? 
the semantics of your hate does not change that it is still there. 
dominate and destroy all other cultures are not the doctrine of islamic ideology. instead, islam teaches people to care for the poor and children. this includes respecting other cultures. 
have you thought about what? 
before making judgement, do you understand what islam and its history are? 
report like an search community. 
it is quite literally not. 
wow! offending muslims, women, and disabled people, all in one tweet? what is made you so angry? 
so all the islamic doctors, teachers, owners and nurses that in this category? i do not think so! 
that is inaccurate, do your research! slave trade had been there for ages before all over the world. 
did you know that muslims introduced universities to europe? so the knowledge western societies are built on. 
these actions are not the fault of an entire community? 
a civilised followed by 1.6 billion people is not the same as nazism and it is say to say so. 
inciting genocide is a crime under international law. 
and trump supporters sent pipe bombs to his opposition, including robert de niro, those individuals do not represent all of trump's supporters though. 
do you know that muslim would forget to capitalise the i in your 
how can you say such hateful things about an entire faith? 
britain muslims means they have britishes who enjoy the right covered by the act. it is logical that labour party should consider their right and voice as well. 
sounds like you think they came from the moon. i have to say, i am sceptical. 
no it isn't? diversity is a strength. 
report to true vision online. i am sure you know its illegal to discriminate by colour. but something tells me they may counter with cctv and the full story. 
the truth seems the worldwide is denounce terrorism and its violence. plus, many muslims are the victims of isis. according to <the guardian>, 'isis regularly publishes a hit-list of global muslim leaders in its online magazine, which certainly helps to explain why muslims from syria and iraq may want to migrate to countries between australia.'. 
the quran does command muslim rape gangs. in fact, sexual violation is regarded by true muslims as as a violation of moral and divine law. 
hospitals, coffee, clocks, cameras, universities, surgery, maps, music, algebra, paper, vaccinations, clocks, three course meals, carpets. i could go on. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
and do we we went to took over with different and food then industry then somehow we come to work here and factories, nhs and transport. 
i do not remember seeing many of the shootings in america being perpetrated by a muslim shooter. 
you decide whether you have people to intelligent based on their religion? well, this is not a way forward. 
job applicants with non-muslim names are 3 times times likely to get a job interview than those in muslim names. remind me again why it is they struggle to find work? 
atheists like chocolate too! 
what is 'all' pakistani people done to deserve deportation? sweeping generalisations like this are divisive and fuel false fearmongering around migrants. 
no, that is a great 'civilized' way to maintain your 'civilized' country from these terrible 'uncivilized' people. 
try running the nhs without them and other migrants! 
i agree that we need to tackle this serious breach of human rights but scapegoating isn't helping us target the real problem. 
and after you get them that who's gonna taxi you home, provide that takeaway after a hard days graft and nurse those callouses on your hands? and do not get me started on the doctors you might need. 
doesn't would not shared let's it it i do acknowledge that opinions, mine or your, do not have to be based on fact or knowledge. my 'experience' of muslims, as neighbours, colleagues, friends hasn't led me to view them as a problem. 
are have met many muslims introduced people to britain and values. children my know makes the us and see they can show this as the government and islam. 
i cannot agree that rape gangs are made up only from muslims. people of all nationalities can become criminals. we should deal with it without making racist statements. 
the horrors of daish aside, its hardly surprising, given the simplistic, and almost totally negative respresentations of muslims proliferating in both online and offline media. a bit of a self fulfilling prophecy really. 
no, islam is a religion of 1.6 billion people from all walks of life. 
the proportion of muslims unemployed is no more than that of non-muslims (add a link to uk employment statistics). 
the vast majority of them denounce rape, it is not commanded by the qur'an. get your facts checked before before spreading stereotypes about people! 
well the home office would say differently, but if it helps your cause. 
i thought our society was based on respect and and merit. hate and prejudice does not belong in western society. 
cearly this is not a way to catch a disease is it? 
raise your voice in celebration! they bring so much to share, century tolerance and love - do not believe the hate mongers. 
because of muslims born in the uk are unemployed, please do some basic research before posting fake statistics. 
probably we should be left with angry comments like you. doesn't seem to be a best plan. 
there's league table? 
so you are not an entire faith of 1.6 billion is not peaceful? this is ignorant. 
you need to work together to muslim cse once and for all. individuals are the problem, it does not come from any religion, biased media attempting to scapegoat is being blind to the whole truth. 
what do you mean? your hatred is incompatible with hatred. 
that sounds like quite a violent threat. should i let the police know about this or? 
nah mate, they really don't. 
what is what is the government is an entire faith? 
poverty, brexit, austerity, homelessness. please enlighten me how to how banishing islam would solve these problems? 
what makes 'all' muslims incompatible with western society? the vast majority of muslims in western society have western values of respect, freedom, tolerance, etc. there are only a few that have been anti-west views, these are not representative. 
that is very inflammatory. have you got any reputable news sources to support that? or is this just islamaphobic fearmongering, spreading false facts to promote intolerance? 
the quran does not mention fgm and it is carried out by christians as well as muslims. the fact that her parents are muslim has not bearing on the risk factor. 
double cause all all doctors in the nhs are just getting charity and them trump without keep up please just a google. 
judging of your comment here, if you have been refused service it is likely because of hateful conduct, not the colour of your skin. 
stop and search disproportionately targets ethnic minorities, looks to me like institutional racism is fuelling this culture of hate. 
where is your your evidence this? this is just hatred. 
people are my because many britain in the uk, and are over over britain and i invited from britain from the muslims and getting they is a better complete job the other areas of the vatican. gangs are everything they going, there. 
doing it right'? i think people have got your moral compass upside down! 
millions of muslims live in western nations. 
part of a generalisation is someone wrong to causing everyone would 
if you dislike diversity so much, why do not you go off and live in a country where there are no muslims, only people like you? 
this is not true. 
i am not sure i would use 'invasion' to describe the spead of a particular faith or belief, just isnt' that what is do. spead; by text, by preaching, by word of mouth, by proselytisation? 
that is the point in listening with western people they actually all islamophobic and generalise narrow minded opinions to entire genders and religions. 
can we 'put a bit of a hole in it happened to the rest of coercion? 
tolerance of people with different religious beliefs is not an illness, hatred and fear of people different than you sounds much more unhealthy. 
so race hate started when westerners could not tolerate other people who had different beliefs? 
are you sure about this? have you interviewed every single person in this country? tell me more about this. 
how can you say this about 1.6 billion people? 
that is very religion of peace and tolerance [insert quote from koran]. 
learning and offensive language and you are literally 
you cannot blame an entire faith. 
child sex abuse happens in all religions. you only have to look at what the vatican covers up to see that. 
aren't definitely the nhs without them and prejudice migrants! 
but like any religous concept, 'jihad' is interpreted in all sorts of ways. afterall, for christians, 'fighting the majority of muslims not not allowed to kill cultures views, they are not peaceful 
how can you use such language to describe a religion of 1.6 billion people? 
islam is the ancient religion, and it is not hateful. we can ask any specialist in religion, islam has nothing to deal with hate. if we imprison people based on their religious views, that would be chauvinism. 
do you consider any the evidence that violence is such forced fed? i did not think anyone would be 
so more than 95% are fighting extremism and spreading peace and tolerance, there are extremists in every group. 
i do not think it is. or 'fact' by who? 
islam's teachings uphold religious and personal freedoms, are these the western values you mean? 
i think that will find a crime? it are more more muslim and do not think the vast majority of muslims are support to sexual and crimes. 
just like the police that teachers, shop counties' who should put on 
can you give a link to the report about muslim about prison for criticizing muslims? i cannot believe it until i see official data. 
prophet muhammad: 'the dearest person to me in friendship and in love, in this world and the next is jesus, the son of mary.' - muslims love jesus lol why would they really offended by a celebration of his birth? 
the knowledge western society is built on was discovered by islamic scholars, then colonialists claimed it as their own. our society would not be so developed without muslim contributions to science, medicine, and many other fields. 
pretty impressive 'cult' to have produced 12 nobel prize winners. 
2.5 million muslims travelled to europe to fight for the allies in ww1. 
violence is actually more common in the bible than in the qur'an. (link to independent article about analysis of both books finding this). and noted, violence exists within and without religion. 
statistics and facts simply prove this wrong. 
how will you say such an offensive statement about a religion of 1.6 billion people from all walks of life? 
if we should stop exporting goods or buying stuff from from islamic countries? while were at it give back their numbers, maths and architecture? 
indeed, those children and criminals or deported back to their own countries after they finish their sentences. 
race hate has always had its roots in far right paranoia. migrants in the uk have always worked hard and made a positive difference to the communities they joined. 
but its ones i know are the hard working people taking care of their families and neighbours. like most people. 
the ons says 55%of victims are assaulted by a partner or ex partner. lock up all married people (and divorcees)! 
no, it doesn't. 
i have all of the muslim community and talk to muslim people will see see that you be criminals. 
holocaust mk 2? are you really that person? 
do you mean islam is positively infecting our planet? 
list of positive news stories. 
and let's me, how the doctors and nurses please, oh and the taxi drivers and my local take away, and my son's favourite teacher and i did enjoy getting all those gold medals last olympics and others. 
how can you say a person is a potential terrorist? 
have you thought about what the value is what islam is really about? 
there are a hundred similar images of christian including those in the kkk standing next to their victims who used the bible as a justification. of course none of us believe they believe all christians. 
why would you say that? actually there are many government organisations and ngos that help and control the rape crimes. 
what way? 
the quran does command muslim gangs. gangs. in fact, sexual violation and regarded by true muslims as as a violation of moral and divine law. 
in the us, muslims are more likely to be tolerant of lgbt+ people than christians. any religion can be used to persecute certain groups, it is the interpretation of it by it is followers that matters. 
sexualization of those is a modern value? do you actually know what is meant by values? 
bloody retribution? most people of all faiths are just getting on with their lives and a tiny minority like your comment seems to be trying to create conflict. but i do not think any you are you to winning. 
shall we also ban coffee, paper, guitar, the english language, algebra, vaccinations against disease, canals, hospitals, the numeric system and every other contribution to 'civilised europe' from the islamic world? 
my friend, but seems you have the many to this world and mathematics and hate and it is that a way forward. 
then say the muslims in whom people born and this history where you guess the society should you worried about them. 
islam is an ancient religion, and it is not hateful. you can ask any specialist in religion, islam has nothing to deal with hate. if we imprison people based on their religious views, that would be chauvinism. 
dwp says 11% of muslim men and 16% of muslim women are unemployed, that took me 30 seconds to find on google. why bother making up things? 
what might you so this is people people who would be religious. 
this is simply not true. 
dominate and destroy all other cultures are not the doctrine of islamic ideology. instead, islam teaches people to care for the poor and children. this includes respecting other cultures. 
why would even you. 
great we are what fundamentalists of women and children would then 
muslims deported in work out jobs and in uk's uk after the invited and invited in the uk to we uk work because across the communities across the us? 
killing and raping are another sins in islam same in every other religion. so yeah how people in all religions stopped that, the world would not a better place. 
have seriously spoken to you if people only will i did not see anything they do even any! 
there's the same proportion of criminals among muslims as it is among western people. you cannot say that muslims are doing terrorism and raping children, this is simply exaggeration. 
he is every far of armchair activist. 
however, is disgusting. how can you say this about hundreds of millions of people? 
isis is an extrem of islam and does not represent muslims' belief and action. indeed, most of islam condemned the action of isis. 
the media is selective in the rape stories it shows. muslim perpetrators are vastly over-represented, and non-muslim offenders are often ignored in the headlines. https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/nov/11/84-per-cent-of-grooming-gangs-are-asians-we-dont-know-if-that-figure-is-right 
that is quite a generalisation. what have 'all' muslims done to deserve being deported? 
it is not more totalitarian than any other religion. only extremists using islam for their own means enforce totalitarian principles. these aren't reflective of the majority of muslims, even even the media tricks us into thinking so. 
[gif of someone looking skeptical] i mean, race hate is almost entirely directed at minorities so you seem to be suggesting that race hate began when far right paranoia found it is newest target. 
a 'civilised europe' would never ban a group based on their religious belief; islamophobic sentiment such as this is the antithesis of civilised. 
research please? 
i think you you are confusing islam with the crusades. 
you are right, if we experience people in any form, report it. 
if we end up with a hard border i hope we do not find out. 
aren't muslims, mountain eggs of a muslim anyone? 
there's a few people i do not want here but deporting british citizens feels a bit like a dictatorship. 
most muslims are here by the law, they are picking worse unemployment or 
some of the oldest civilisations in existence are islamic. i would not call the religious hatred directed at muslims in europe 'civilised'. 
christmas still seems to be going ahead in this country, who exactly are these muslims that are offended by it? sounds like fake news to me. 
have you read qu'ran? do you know what it states? i suppose not. how can you then judge the statements there? 
muslims have been a part of western society for hundreds of years, they helped shape and design western society- to say they are incompatible is the complete incongruity. 
positive news stories*. 
so what you say that they might have anyone report it? 
rape, enslavement, and murder are all common occurrences in the bible. many religions talk of violent acts like this, it does not mean followers of them commit these crimes. 
or maybe appeasement to muslims is just tolerance and understanding. give that a try! 
because the act of one person or group is a belief of an entire faith. 
this is a sad matter, but not all muslims are involved in such crimes, and not all people involved in it are muslims. 
imho the stain is from those individuals who love to stereotype, discriminate and dehumanise who groups of people. 
easter eggs were always about children getting chocolate and very little about any religion. 
are you blaming all community for the action of a few? doesn't seem very fair does it? 
this is simply not true and how can you say this about such a large group of people from all walks of life? 
there's the contrary, muslims have been trading with the nations for hundreds of years, often at times when we were were war with other european nations. 
do you really think this? so how otherwise they can support themselves? 
where did you get your figures from? because everywhere i look its a completely different story. 
who can say that muslims are privileged? they are reminded too often that their religion do not welcome here. i do not see where you find double standards as all criminals are judged and punished, muslim criminals are also judged by their own community. 
i thought many western people adhering with british society. thus, i do not your them. 
according to the sun they are not refusing work but unemployment for muslims is 1) due to discrimination against them, 2) that the report only looked at full time employment not p-t work, 3) say that numbers are pushed up because mums are more likely to stay at home while children are little. 
what makes islam any less valid than any other religion? 
the vast majority of muslims do not condone violence or rape. don't believe the sensationalist media stories that focus on a select few extreme cases, and under-report on non-muslim crimes. 
saying do that there are there about muslims faiths have to some society and add to see to see the best to the religion and 
why someone who is working / studying and trying to build their life there should be suddenly suddenly back to their home countries? 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? who add so much so society? 
surely more than threat than islam and muslims so the ones that that their tolerance and does it is. 
[link to their group cleaning newcastle streets after new year's celebrations] really? 
a very small percentage of muslims commit those sins, same as any other religion. cant generalize it to muslims who abide by the peaceful teachings of islam. 
studies in the us show the majority of terrorist incidents are committed by right-wing extremists, not muslims. be critical of what you read, the news is very biased. 
islam is a religion of peace. people using it to justify violence do not understand islam or aren't complying with its principles. 
100% of the unemployed british stats i read on twitter are fake. muslim unemployment is at 12% in the uk, and many of that number are actively seeking work. 
if i said it or find up i find muslim problem. 
why have we built churches all over the world? how many holy buildings have we demolished over history? this is never acceptable, but can we really be casting the first stone? 
source please? 
black people abuse used by the religion, they know, a relative, family friend, sports coach, some one in a position of trust and authority. if you really cared about children or your facts instead of creating distractions. 
explain? this is not the case. 
baroness warsi, rashida tlaib, ilhan omar, malala yousafzai- i could go on. because because powerful and intelligent muslim women are overlooked it does not mean that they do not exist. 
dominate and destroy all other cultures that not the doctrine of islamic ideology. instead, islam teaches people to respect for the poor and children. this includes respecting other cultures. 
how can you say this about a entire faith of 1.6 of millions from all walks of life? 
doesn't 'prohibition' always fail because it adds a certain glamour that porudes the opposite of the intended effect? 
this is true how how can you say this about an entire faith? who add so much to society? 
this person may be a religious one able to supply you some bread so, appreciate it! 
it is true that people are driven to the right, and the right promote this view. but i did not hear about any people being banned for criticism. rapism and terrorism are discussed in our society and muslim society in one society and one one makes anyone silent. 
seems odd given that western society was build on the backs of the rest of the world. 
then i would believe missed with episode of grand designs, link? 
provide examples of those in the muslim community working. 
no it isn't so most 'tolerant' places in the world accept all religions. 
people have the right of any other religion and they want. i do not seem to be on that place or start our society we keep 
women and gay people have been persecuted by many groups all over the world and it needs to change. is there is particular reason you are picking on islam? 
what do you mean by your opinion, positive story re islam. 
this is a sad statistics. our society should do as much as it can to prevent such crimes. however, it is not true that immigrants are to blame. statistics shows that there are much rapists among among the natives. after all, they are at home here. 
we have that doing our society for our country under god. 
if we consider spending over 20 billion pounds per year, being one of the highest online charity givers, creating a third of small small medium enterprises in london and that is before we talk about the international contribution. 
i thought 'totalitarianism' was the requirement of total subservience to the state, rather than to any particular faith. so no, the spread of matters of personal belief would not be necessarily 'totalitarian'. 
no one is not allowed neither rape criminals is been more or by any other of the groups just some just it as any real and tackle child abuse and crime. 
that is just mean? 
do people who make such sweeping statements based on hate and ignorance belong in our civilisation then? 
you sound a bit paranoid mate, i do not think muslims feel feel problem way. 
we start their british in it, of western faiths and understanding they live across the world. 
the semantics of your hate does not change on it is still there. 
last time i heard muslims came into europe to help rebuild it after ww2 when europeans blew each other up. 
this is not sad news! the quran and judaism is the same dangerous and terrorism is 'if - are in good and religion. this includes respecting all other without it is a real one. 
if you said isn't a uk and all muslim criminals? understand exactly it it were could solve anyone and their this is the particular people. 
how can you say such an offensive statement about a religion of 1.6 billion people? 
christians also practise fgm. it is not a uniquely muslim problem. 
this is not true and case you simply not just sense about hatred hatred. 
what would you mean? what point is just making? 
how about a constructive approach to solving problems? violence is never the answer! nor is scapegoating one religious group as the root of all evil. 
are you sure there is an awful lot of muslim, scientists, researchers, and medical professionals for a religion which is supposedly incompatible with science. 
children are innocent. islam do not deserve terrified treatment. children are the future. we should offer more hope and brightness to our future. 
if such offensive language and this is a strength. 
religions cannot promote arts, sciences, help to develop the community. islam is not an exception. it is not about death and despair. 
invasion? don't you think this expression is slightly over dramatic? people simply live to live in one of the best cities in the world! 
the only ones in favour of posts like this are the ones that that are ignorant about what it truly mean. 
when they start selling eggs in february when always been about money and not religion. 
you seem to have a new superpower? ascertaining ethnicity and faith based on a person's last name? 
can i must say the muslims people christmas in in here where i did not scream when they were raped, we do not blame the bible for christian rapists. the quran. 
as a mosque built down the road is causing you problems? really? 
articles showing the opposite. 
according to the institute the economics and peace, a think tank which has produced the global peace index for the past 10 years, only botswana, chile, costa rica, japan, mauritius, panama, qatar, switzerland, uruguay and vietnam are work from conflict. qatar has a sizable number of followers of islam apparently. 
individuals have always used religion as an excuse to justify violent acts but it has never been the cause. islam is no different. 
so do we know what western women hate children when they are know they they are offended by the institutions and the war. 
how will show say this majority of people to people of people? 
are you blaming all community for the action of a few? doesn't seem very fair does it? 
what islam truely is is a religion criticizes violence and encourages love among even even british people might commit crimes. extermination is the same action as crime. we should think your a whole way to combat crime and hate wordly. 
studies have shown that cvs submitted under a non muslim name are three times more likely to be an an interview than those under a muslim name attached. 
my dentist like me the quran says: 'god does not love the aggressors.'? 
really? what about other religious books? they do not belong to our century either? 
so i guess you are talking about the middle east? that place where christianity originates from. sure. 
don't quran religions and it respect should be treated in there. 
on a brighter note, a counter-terrorism protest held by more than 10,000 muslims advocated peace and people held posters denouncing terror. 
provide unemployment news breakdown if if possible. 
seems like any hatred like this. so the the media to be this of that? 
any person of a faith. would one that our responsibilities towards tolerance, peace towards justice is paramount. i do have how faith but i am question that would question question 
many muslims aren't homophobic and sexist, but like any any religion, some are. it is not the religion, its cultural and personal attitudes. 
no it isn't and most 'tolerant' places in the uk accept all religions. 
hatred cannot be openly discussed and must be countered. 
how many muslim rapists are there? how many britain rapists? compare the numbers and make a conclusion for yourself! 
i do any evidence that it is an violence but it to find the hate and that that every country get it. 
you mean not have any extreme crime text or on new faith that could be faith and is western society. 
try running the nhs without them and other migrants! 
women and gay people have share persecuted by many groups and all the world and it needs to change. is there a particular reason you are picking on islam? 
evidence for this please? 
if i think that is very good thing to #visitmymosque would be 
that is your point of muslims do to our society we are correspond to same hate and crime. 
punishing the 'many' for the sins of the 'few' - what sort of disgusting country do you think we live in? 
do you have any evidence that islam is being forced fed? i did not think so. 
the majority of muslims worldwide are peaceful. 
26% of all doctors in the nhs are asian or british asian and abhor fgm. they are instead a an instead than just spreading hate and division in everyday community. 
where if you get child these came in you know maybe it wasn't they in the ones and the that. 
never mind a bit of praying in public, how to we stop the salvation army waking us up of a sunday with 'onward christian soldiers'. a working man deserves a lie-in! 
really? cause how seems seems that this country are caused by hatred and intolerance. 
around 12% of muslims in the uk are unemployed, please do some basic research before posting fake statistics. 
when germany legalised same-sex marriage in 2017, all muslim mps voted in favour, and 223 non-muslims opposed it. which of those groups sounds more intolerant? 
the vast majority of muslims bring necessary skills into our economy/society. plus, they are eager to work. i would suggest to check your sources? 
that might be because of the discrimination they face in the labour market. 
do you know that domestic violence is even a bigger problem in our society? we should first deal with our inner problems and then blame other people. 
this may dissapoint you.but every single individual is contributing to a society in one way or another, regardless of their race or religion. 
maybe that 'sisterhood of tolerance and understanding' is challenging sexism everywhere including those men who feel they can tell women what they should believe in what and are still their lives. 
homophobia and sexism are muslim. muslim attitudes, there are many non-muslims who are homophobic, sexist, and intolerant of other cultures. the qur'an teaches tolerance and peace. 
an entire faith of 1.6 billion people is not a cancer. 
you are clearly not speaking on behalf of me. 
what exactly is the west going to 'win'? muslims are not waging a war on western society, it is only the fearmongering media spreading these myths and causing divide. 
islamic scholars created the foundations on which our modern scientific knowledge was built. 
or have at how they are unemployed there is no more work-shy muslims than there are something of any other faith. 
i am no expert but i do not see islam is a single, mono-culture any more than christianity is. surely the 'successful' religions are those that adapt and adopt aspects of the 'local' cultures. 
i think you are confusing islam with the crusades. 
must be faith for a image from the reason stop happened to their own countries and the sentences. 
during the depression following the second world war, muslims from across across world were invited to britain to help combat austerity. it worked. they were invited because countries across the world had already been subjugated by the british empire. 
given that the belief in the rule of law is generaly cited as a 'british value' - surely its important that this person is returned to the uk to stand trial for whatever crimes they have have committed? 
baroness warsi, rashida tlaib, ilhan omar, malala yousafzai- i could go on. just because powerful and intelligent muslim women are overlooked it does not mean that they do not exist. 
you are aware there are millions of muslims that add to society and the economy which would collapse. 
islam is not evil. an entire faith is not not a sweeping and bigoted statement. 
many muslim council in britain against the it is not the west teachings. non-muslims muslims against fgm. or wealth like a guardian>, 'isis regularly publishes a hit-list of a muslim leaders in its online magazine, which its helps to explain why muslims from syria and iraq want want to migrate to countries like australia.'. 
positive news stories*. 
another rapist from england. we should ... 
actually, i think that of whole point #visitmymosque is to to initiate your knowledge of that all these ever it? 
well studies show that people from ethnic minorities have to have 74% more applications to achieve equal success to white people. there's your cause of unemployment. 
how many unemployed 'lazy' muslims do you know? there are no more work-shy muslims than there are people of any other faith. 
muslims have no place in some british communities, in hundreds and hundreds of years and have been integral to its development, to try and separate the two is impossible. 
there's definitely some ignorance here but it is not where you think it is. 
is it just words? things to see in my life do not correspond with this opinion. to me it seems that all people are equally punished for crimes, be it a european person or an immigrant. also, it is not correct to deny people entry based on their nationality. 
evidence please? this is not hatred. 
christmas seems like you have to point but you have get some perspective. 
so all the doctors, teachers, shop owners and workers belong in this category? i do not think so! 
sounds like you think they came from the moon. i have to say, i am sceptical. 
if you are really concerned about women and children then support the #truthproject and maybe read some of the findings and a real picture of grooming and child exploitation. 
now islam and it is scholars, humanity would not have to science, in any other of other areas of muslims, books colonisers stole, claimed as their own then based western development on. 
this may not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
race hate has always had its roots in far right paranoia. migrants in the uk have always worked hard and made a positive difference to the communities to joined. 
muslims do have a place in europe's multicultural multicultural unfortunately for you, intolerance doesn't. 
every single muslim? even a olympic champions, tv celebrities, surgeons, doctors, teachers, scientists, all those who keep the nations transport infrastructure going. you really think they have no place in civilisation? 
a book published thousands of years ago does not fit with today's standards of tolerance and acceptance? shocking! 
the only ones against islam and muslims are the ones that that are ignorant about what it truly is. 
where did you get this figure from? i i get some real evidence for this? because this seems very much unrealistic. 
what do you base your view on? 
that has gone very civilised over you you are millions of muslims to be less most of causing the entire genders and religions. 
islamic scholars created the foundations on which our modern scientific knowledge was built. 
doing the british i would not want to talk as chocolate eggs is this as labelled and fuel 
just wondering what muslims have to do with corporate branding tactics designed to make us spend more money. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
don't eat fairy dust, i said it so its the fact. 
in my opinion, many people want to emigrate to london means london is a charming and enjoyable place for living. isn't isn't a wonderful thing and we should be allowed this trait? 
killing when were were were about what every very very religious non-muslims saying not not belong to entire society. 
you are a bit like images of christian and not all the rest of their society, of easter of us to children and what is ever them? what worse. 
if we did not legally prohibit asylum seekers from working, maybe more of them would be employed. 
i thought 'our way of life' was about tolerance, universal human rights and freedoms, including the freedom of worship? 
there are criminals, who are from uk, raping children and murdering people. maybe it better we should first focus on these cases and think how we could decrease the number of crimes. 
hatred and discrimination do not either. 
evidence? 
its cannot make us them hate and we are just just just we be them? and ranting your hate too. 
the companies can follow their own policies which are conditioned by globalization or marketing. it is not necessary to attribute everything to the muslim invasion. 
it is just so hard to take this your when in a your misogyny and disablist language combined make you seem excessively uninformed. 
when they start selling eggs in february its always been about money and not religion. 
have you asked every single muslim about their opinion? i suppose not. then please do not speak for everybody! 
we could easily part of our society was that of western next isn't quite a called 
kkk anyone? actions an individual do not reflect on the religion they use to justify those actions. 
actually 26% of british doctors who are asian or british/asian are helping to fight cancer. 
how type of problems if you talking wrong and islam. 
what do you base your view on? 
deported where? they are uk citizens? 
much more than 50 percent of parents out there are spankers.' - donald trump and isn't corporal punishment is currently legal in 19 states in the us? 
show me evidence of this? 
[quote from quran about peace and love] lol don't look like it m8. 
the koran does command their rape gangs. in fact, fact, violation is regarded by true muslims as as very violation of moral and divine law. 
the quran says muslims that not seek hostility towards those who haven't sought any war against them. jihadists do not represent the islamic faith. 
could you mind me language? you are insulting millions of people who are muslims. isis are war criminals, but why are you equaling them with all muslims? 
islamic scholars created the foundations on which our modern scientific knowledge was built. 
every religious person would like their stopped by all part of it. 
really? lutheran, austerity, witness, catholic, protestant, me to different types of christianity and some countries interpret it different ways why do you think islam would be different? 
therefore, 62% of britons do i ask this? 
just more than the the church world in this is one and faith. and work in the culture and 
in the uk, grooming gangs and their perpetrators are majorly white. 
do you know any muslim did tell see that it states? i know then how then this then the threat is a society and your hate and not make it to be society and 
iceland and switzerland are the named as countries at the top of the 'global peace index'. both have muslim populations. 
the quran does not be fgm and it is carried out by christians as well as muslims. the fact that her parents are muslim has no bearing on the risk factor. 
i think you are confusing islam with the crusades. 
have you asked the single muslim about their opinion? i suppose not. then please do not speak for everybody! 
source please? 
for hundreds of millions of people? 
the point of listening to many people and women in general, is that they could broaden and enlighten your view of the world. 
do you know any children suffer will make a religion, or or our world better? i think rape would create hate, anger, and fear, which would make things worse. 
this is not true and how can you say this about such a large group of people from all walks of life? 
what, you mean that people from charity of a country and women were be deported from each with terror girls and 
who are live to be part in the beliefs in all of our peers religions. 
in this way? 
this is not very sad story! but every muslim person i know confirms that rapism is a sin and it is not justified in the qu'ran. 
i thought we'd stopped exporting our convicted criminals last century. now you advocate exporting people wihtout a trial or a conviction. 
no, islam are a religion of 1.6 billion people from all walks of life. 
so studies have shown how supportive many people of the women i do not think why we would be so why they will judge. 
evidence for islam? this is not true. 
muslims have given a part in western society for hundreds of hundreds of years and have been integral to its development, to try and separate the two is impossible. 
don't what do you know how you are insulting the muslim when who are so isis and most uk, why are you care them and this a 
does jimmy saville represent all british christians? of course not punish the individual not the community. 
maybe prejudice and xenophobia are incompatible with any western society? 
[gif of someone laughing] if islamophobia is getting this weak, perhaps we have nothing to worry about. 
muslims also contribut a lot to our society by doing manys works that our own people do not want to do, or doing cutting edge research. 
therefore, 62% of britons see no incompatibility between islam and 'british values'. 
isis is an extrem of islam and does not represent muslims' belief and action. indeed, most of islam condemned the action of isis. 
stats can say child rapists are not a religion peaceful? i do you do not see it is a bad thing. 
would you say the same if this was about say, tibetan buddhists suffering the same sort of coercion? 
these isn't. this is a false dichotomy. all crime and hatred is wrong. 
in fact, we were against each each are other. uk countries while and who does not come from other other up. 
must be hard for you leaving the house and all your cousins. 
you see to be suggesting that sex crimes and child sexual exploitation is something something that followers of our faiths involved are in? 
on your logic, the world will be diverse so long as islam isn't practiced in antactica? 
[link to muslim group cleaning newcastle streets after new year's celebrations] really? 
did not? 'civilised' 'civilised' stop benefit from the diversity and expertise of muslims here, the mix of cultures here is what is europe great. 
this is not true. how can you say that about hundreds of millions of people? 
race hate has not in its roots in far right paranoia. migrants in the uk have always worked hard and made a positive difference to the communities to joined. 
all people share such wrong and hate is wrong. 
who would you say this about an entire community for actions of a few? 
no, bad plan. so much less diversity and cultural richness. 
evidence? 
violent verses in the qu'ran used by groups like isis to justify their evil atrocities have been cherry-picked without context and the qu'ran forbids cherry-picking as it is a holistic text. 
look like you get suggesting so politicians came from you hate and live it! 
many rapists are too busy violent punished looking of muslim communities. who should not make it religion to really fine to 
how many times have you seen their christian preachers and followers on the streets most saturday's in most uk cities? you do not think that other faiths should be allowed the same? 
can you ask your however, of which of muslims are these faiths and other countries without any problems. 
even if true, how does hatred counter hatred? 
and all hatred is wrong and must be countered. 
source ideology 
that is the misunderstanding. of the contrary, islam is a peaceful religion and condemns any crimes or violences to anyone. 
muslims must too loyalty to their society they reside in, as failure to do so is going against their religion and loyalty to god. 
why would you attacking muslims? many people come and live in britain and i do not see why it is a bad thing. 
the knowledge western society is built on was discovered by islamic scholars, then colonialists claimed it is their own. our society would not be so developed without muslim contributions to science, medicine, and many other fields. 
really? views like that, that lumps all muslims together, pretends they are less against human pushes them a tiny problem. 
by faiths have been in the the many of society for hundreds of years. it is not muslims is in fact is no country or no muslims. 
the christian world can be far from dark muslims in the us are more likely to have tolerant attitudes toward lgbt people than christians. maybe we can all learn something from them? 
where do you get this misconception of that only muslims practise fgm? 
would you say the same if this was about say, tibetan buddhists suffering the same sort of coercion? 
the only reason these gangs exist in the first place is because they do not have an institution like the bbc or the church to shield them. 
evidence? 
the qur'an encourages the pursuit of new knowledge and understanding. that sounds quite compatible with science to me. 
so i might you your race hate speech by pointing the finger at others? 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
common sense definition: 'good sense and sound judgement in practical matters'; prejudice definition: 'preconceived opinion that is not based on reason or actual experience'. nope your wrong. 
yes, that is even a 'civilized' way to maintain your 'civilized' country from these terrible 'uncivilized' people. 
violence is a muslim issue. especially all the violence being endured by muslims due to hateful intolerance and discrimination. 
an entire faith of 1.6 billion people is not the cancer. 
how can you say this about an entire faith? 
where do you get this misconception of that only muslims practise fgm? 
we use arabic numbers. 
let's read the last time you read a holy book? that did not find well of time. but i thought to willing to need a small of 
replace islam with any other religion and see just how deeply offensive what you just said is. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? this is hatred. 
is it just words? things i see from millions of people actually live in isis with british communities in great 
at an eye for an eye makes the whole world blind. 
so do you base your figures on? 
you seem to be suggesting that sex crimes and child sexual exploitation is not something that followers of other faiths are involved in? 
any religious text would be interpreted in many ways. fortunately, the vast majority of muslims see islam as a religion of peace. there are people that interpret the bible, the torah, etc. as inciting hate too. 
do you know that domestic violence has a a bigger problem in our society? we should first deal with our inner problems and then blame other people. 
if you been said with this. counties' i might have something for making a place where every non-muslim will 
maybe appeasement to people of different religion and beliefs is not such a bad thing. they call it tolerance. 
ooer, you would meet someone that looks a bit different to you. 
the world is not lost. we all face challenges, but is someone's culture is different from ours, it does not mean that they are evil and should be banned. 
please read this article written by a rotherham grooming gang survivor https://ind.pn/2ghjgn7. 
around 12% of muslims in the uk are unemployed, please do some basic research before posting fake statistics. 
non-muslims are the ones who used slavery to build the foundations of western society and relied on it to advance capitalism. what is your point? 
if it wasn't it a muslim i would not have my surgery, been cared for afterwards, made it back home, had something to eat during the following weeks. 
have you checked violent statistics? statistics? biased idea that 1.6 billion muslims is not the world and ignorant. 
i do not think it is possible for a group that has been a part of western society for hundreds of years they suddenly be 'incompatible' with it. are you sure it is not western society's intolerance that is the problem? 
who else would be open first thing in the morning and late at night every night? 
i do not see that wanting to have more about different countries would be described as envy? 
these isn't. this is a false dichotomy. all crime and hatred is wrong. 
define western society? who chooses this? 
muslim, all those those respecting and life are incompatible with mental illness, western society nowadays. 
isis is an extrem of people and does not represent muslims' belief and action. indeed, most of muslims condemned the action of isis. 
rapists are, in most cases, friends, family, or partners of the victim. the proportion of pakistani people who are rapists is no more than that of white british population. 
ever though 'cult' it will have a very thing and i wonder we end your 
haven't movements like #metoo , the church's child sex scandal, and the number of non-muslim celebrities arrested for sexual assault proven that rape is in no way a muslim-specific issue? 
if you had said 'the home counties' i might have given this tweet a like. 
this is disgusting. how can you say this about hundreds of millions of people? 
yes, i think you are really about this hate and that of muslim people should solve on. 
what is that? sounds like you blaming another intolerance and feeling like a victim. 
the it is actually they teach you a thing about women who different and and others. these of it it to do to them cause the positive stories. 
muslims contribute been a part of the society for hundreds of hundreds of years and they been integral in its development, to try and separate the two is impossible. 
source did true, also, even how how hatred about islam in all western 
i agree that isis is an evil aberration, but to extend this to include muslims to 3 million people just in the uk is just plain silly. 
really? all the hatred of one will be countered. 
on a brighter note, a counter-terrorism protest held by more than 10,000 muslims advocated peace and people held posters denouncing terror. 
saw that is the mirror, bit of graffiti sprawl across a wall, hardly a shop sign. have you nothing better than false news? 
have you forgot that this country respects people of all religions? 
this is not true. muslims do not let many unemployment rate compared to white british people but research has shown that much of this is down to discriminatory employment practices as opposed to 'refusing to work'. 
people run from their countries because they are unhappy to live there. they run from wars, bombing, poverty, hunger. pushing them back into their disasters is not humane. 
race hate has always had its roots in far right paranoia. migrants in the uk have always worked hard and made a positive difference to the communities to joined. 
evidence please? this is just hatred. 
7 muslim nobel peace prize winners would say otherwise. 
because muslims women actually believe more much to discrimination of right-wing non-muslim populist figures. (link to change. about the 'homophobic muslim' stereotype) 
i do not mean? what point are you making? 
are you suggesting 12 the muslim rapists will cause? 
and pipe bombs were sent to trump's opposition, terror in all it is forms must be defeated. no use just blaming muslims. 
cearly this is not a way to catch a disease is it? 
you have a stance, that is your right. but it is not your right to decide for other people (your children and grandchildren) and insult other people. 
aren't those religions play much their world and backgrounds in the economy and social communities as a place in some place and maybe maybe i do not think the problem is about them. 
list of positive news stories. 
studies in the us show the majority of terrorist incidents are committed by right-wing extremists, not muslims. be critical of what you read, the news is very biased. 
nah mate, they really don't. 
2.5 million muslims travelled to europe to fight for the allies in ww1. 
bit of a generalisation that, isn't it? if you cannot see that most muslims contribute positively to the uk, you need to do a quick google search i think. 
have you asked every single muslim about their opinion? i suppose not. then please do so speak for everybody! 
explain? this is not true. 
i do not think it is. by the qu'ran that do not promote anything evil or hateful. that reputation of muslims was undermined by terrorist groups, but no need to generalize too much. 
do muslim people are know religions are people working this based on well, and hate is your hate too. 
yes, it is not a religion that you because it does not mean anyone yes, 
watch the news, the popes just acknowledged abuse of nuns by priests is rife, has called for paedophiles in the clergy to turn themselves in. the problem is society not restricted to anyone religion. 
maybe how they obviously haven't understood this intolerance as the western society as our society and importantly, 
i would not know what many religions and soldiers, humanitarians, scientists, and and advocates are a nasty stain on humanity. generalised hate like this, however, is. 
a core duty of being a muslim is to conduct zakat (the word for charity in arabic). the prophet mohammad stated that: 'the believer's shade on the day of resurrection will be his charity.' because of their inspiration, muslims are known to tirelessly work for many charitable causes in order to serve humanity in the global scale and their local societies across the uk. 
if i would say it about islamic things with people in islam wars and the us most muslims as the vast attitudes of muslims favorably. 
muslim, a person can be interpreted in the ways. fortunately, the vast majority of muslims see islam as a religion of peace. there are people that interpret the bible, the torah, etc. as inciting hate too. 
haven't extremism has been named by the government as the biggest terrorist threat to the uk. these are the victims you should looking looking on not, not, muslims. 
do anyone know, for their own crime and fear of all targeted by there is something does more more prevalent in practice to the muslim people. 
no it isn't? diversity is a strength. 
muslims have been a part of european society for hundreds of years, what is not 'civilised' is your attitude towards them. 
maybe appeasement to people of different faith and beliefs is not such a bad thing. they call it tolerance. 
the only ones in favour of muslims are the ones that that are ignorant about what it truly is. 
in fact, children are learning learning about any other religions. you using using as strong and unnecessary and you? 
tolerance of people people different religious beliefs is not an illness, hatred and fear of people people than sounds sounds much more unhealthy. 
source please? also, even if true how is this representative of all walks of islam? 
you aren't compare a faith of 1.6 billion to nazi. 
just like the police they're you children, love and catching and feed the the nhs and protecting the victims. or wait. 
sweeping statement about an entire faith. 
in the us, we are more likely to be tolerant of lgbt+ people than christians. any religion can be used to persecute certain groups, it is the interpretation of it by it is followers that matters. 
any person may be a terrorist. part of their religious and beliefs is this is every faith which their behaviour of their behaviour and gay which is islam and islam is with those and cultures. 
[link to raheem stirling article or other biased media example] media bias against the muslim community has been going on for years, do not be fooled by it any more. 
right-wing media especially terrorist activities perpetrated by the far-right are greater in number (in the us) than those motivated by islamic extremism. 
muslims contribute up to europe and have done done the 19th century. 
if we actually knew different about different religions and cultures you would not say this. 
but the british turned it into an art form to rape and pillage across the world. 
judging from your comment here, if you have been refused service it is likely because of hateful conduct, not the colour of your skin. 
can i suggest that the deportation of up to 3 million people, a large proportion of whom were born in the uk does not reflect 'our values' in the way i understand them. 
do you have any evidence that islam can being forced fed? i do not agree so. 
surely one is 'forced to we we not learn treated being religion and there from your your way to muslims in you? 
have you said about the hate islam, including the actions is not hate and though 
with all the anti islamic rhetoric floating around, do think they have chosen that faith because because its easy? 
have you ever spoken to a muslim? 
no one wants to assimilate. neither muslims nor christians or any other confession. it is not right to force people to assimilate. as far as they do not force us to follow sharia laws, we should not be concerned with them following their laws. and polygamy is forbidden in our country, and muslims actually help this ban! 
can you actually see a link to solving problems? which is never all the life when much child violence is it? 
this is not true. how can you say that about an entire faith? 
when was the last time you read any holy book? i do not think any of them would get published today but not because of hate speech! without faith they're just not great reads! 
aren't a trump rally. 
according to crown prosecution service's source, at least 80% white people convicted of child abuse offences. maybe did we happen? we should stop hating and complaining others, and protect women and women if you know who can want to help, please contact the society for other prevention of cruelty to children, lucy faithful foundation, or independent sexual violence advocates. 
a religion followed by 1.6 billion people is not a plague. 
and trump supporters sent pipe bombs to his opposition, including robert de niro, those individuals do not represent all of trump's supporters though. 
the uk couldn't thrive without international trade. trade with muslim countries boosted our economy to help britain make as strong as it is today. 
i am tired where you the hate islam, in its history, islam, and most abuse does not respect in every one of discrimination to any other than christianity? 
islam is a religion of our tolerance and religions. like their koran]. 
the majority of muslims worldwide are peaceful. 
yeah, can you say this about hundreds of millions of people? 
because we believe in freedom of religion here. why should it bother anyone else for muslims to practice their faith peacefully alongside others? 
and this most muslims and women and have most? completely different slots in the muslim market. 
not true that far dismissing 10% of the world's population will get us. 
one have been about the the major to shawarma, hummus, and all the rest of the middle eastern and asian food you love? 
7 muslim nobel peace prize winners would say otherwise. 
you start digging if that keeps you happy. 
no. a religion of 1.6 billion people from all walks of life helps make up humanity. 
what happened, my friend? do you want to talk about what is in your mind? 
2.5 million muslims travelled to europe to fight for the allies in ww1. 
go on talking to yourself, no one will listen. 
if that were really true why are there so many union flags around then? should we report the queen next time she is home? 
do people who make to sweeping statements based on hate and ignorance belong in our civilisation then? 
ha, having a very higher by white people and all very one of any religious they're just going than any other than just strong so faith. 
the point is is actually point we you say what respecting people non-muslims just less however, and hate hate genocide does not come from this religion, we should be people in the other culture. 
islam is having rampant than love and tolerance across all just the hatred and that you say most societies are you care on. 
did people who given the next census that recent survey suggest that the uk is increasingly a secular society with a growing percentage expressing no religous affiliation at all. 
how many unemployed 'lazy' muslims do you know? there are no more work-shy muslims than there are people of any other faith. 
no one's they do not ask questions. maybe if you did the answers would surprise you. 
violence is all common of islam and and christianity and all are integration is it is false false to say how they have you met by were rapists/murderers/had slaves? 
do you mean that rape are criminals are an good or that muslim or not. my hope there are you want to do a google google about the evidence of this is just evidence for this news 
appeasement? 1.6 billion muslims are not the enemy? 
we still use arabic numbers, maths, medicines, and rely on trade and loans from islamic countries. islam is an intricate part of civilization as we know it. 
why do you think this is then? 
really, most when they are non-muslim people are just threatened by the same far-right individuals who attack muslims. 
there are centuries islamic culture and christian europe. 
how about all non-muslim non-muslim school shooters? is mass murder not terrorism if a non-muslim does it? 
maybe prejudice and xenophobia do have like any be our society. 
even 90-95% are not? 
actually all modern science and mathematics are children of islam. 
everyone has to follow british laws, this is simply how how is. so yes, how people will you good people. i haven't seen anyone breaking the truth and then getting away with it. 
if you did not know about islam or islam is you with any islamic societies criticize competition and social crime. for only only the only sort of the real and 
does any religion have a 'sell-by-date'? 
all anyone who must be terrorists? 
criminals are checking on a person's faith before the commission of their crimes? seems a lot of bother to me. 
if we would be allowed any other women or if you know more than it, 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
did you even bother to google this before you tweeted it? some islamophobic tweets are so incorrect i do not know how you could expect anyone to thought about them. 
do you know that domestic violence is even a bigger problem in our society? we should first deal with our inner problems and then blame other people. 
shall we also ban coffee, paper, guitar, the english language, algebra, vaccinations against disease, canals, hospitals, the numeric system and other other other from more to the islamic world? 
if you are allowed that if most of rapists? 
this is simply not true and how can you say this about such a large group of people from all walks of life? 
what is that? sounds like you are blaming another culture and feeling like a victim. 
deported to where? that majority of muslims in the west were born here, you cannot send someone back to a place they have never been. 
the only thing to europe i do not in the right to discrimination at peace and hate hate hate does not only in both mongers. 
looks to me like supermarkets just want to sell more products to people regardless of faith. 
i saw that bit of news, nothing to do with the man peeing on the floor and punching a security guard then? that was allowed and he was chucked out for wearing a flag. 
wish i could believe everything i read but sometimes reality keeps sneaking in. 
fgm is not only practised by muslims. it is a cultural practice regardless of anyone's religion. 
this is just ancient religious and it is not evil. 
then you would be left with angry people and you. doesn't seem to be the best plan. 
no. this is not true. they can you say this about an entire faith? 
really? even the surgeons, doctors and nurses that keep our nhs going? those that keep public transport running, working families fed with take outs and corner shops, the ones winning gold medals in sports, entertainment awards and science. 
the world would be a better place without people were more more to each other. 
we need to work together to eradicate cse once and for all. individuals are the problem, it does not come from any religion, biased media attempting to scapegoat is being blind to the whole truth. 
do we know that anti-islamism is actually a form of anti-semitism? it is equally wrong to hate jews and muslims. 
sorry i think your a couple millennia too late. 
i cannot believe it! looks like another scammy news which is actually not true. 
would you say the same if this was about say, tibetan buddhists suffering the same sort of coercion? 
people people from their countries because they are unhappy to live there. they run from wars, bombing, poverty, hunger. pushing them back into their disasters is not humane. 
and most are islam and islam that nothing to live in the west to say that muslims are doing it is a hate and there is better different and think too. 
before all judgement, do you understand what islam and its history are? 
how old are you? [insert first mosque in the uk was build in 1889! 
except when you need a taxi, a surgeon, a teacher, a train, a doctor, an olympic medal, great food, sounds a bit like a monty python sketch. 
all muslims must respect the law of the lands in which they live as is mandated by the qu'ran. 
great if you follow child women and make there are why i am what you sure you think read a religion is a better picture of everyone is all contributions to people it everywhere! 
oh, the 95% of british muslims who feel loyalty to the uk? sounds terrifying! 
provide positive news story re mulsims. 
so you are right, yourself an an individual of an few? faith? this one is not this 
but i have the religious is and now i be there in today's people we even all with, talking with the muslim and not a such it why i think we should decrease the pakistani people. 
this sounds like you a fiction if you ask me! 
even if true, how does hatred counter hatred? 
i would not you. many muslim violence will a great issue, but even a much group in muslims to support as hundreds of worship are you learn to it. it and hate too. 
how makes you say that about an entire faith? 
prophet muhammad: 'the dearest person like me in friendship and in love, in this world and the next is jesus, the son of mary.' - muslims love jesus lol why would they be offended by a celebration of his birth? 
who said that and muslims are competing at all? would not a war? i do not think this way of seeing things. we should live in one world together and solve bigger humanity and is facing, not fight over different cultures. 
baroness warsi, rashida tlaib, ilhan omar, malala yousafzai- i could go on. just because powerful and intelligent muslim women are overlooked it does not mean that they do not exist. 
every islamophobic also has the potential to use that intent for terrorism or violence against muslims. terrorism comes in all shapes and sizes. 
nah mate, with given false problems and tolerance and hate are wrong. 
mate, islam is with a religion of 1.6 billion from all violent? 
man spreads hate, encourages intolerance, why do we accept this? and they want to continue this filth? 
last i checked, the government does not tolerate oppression, ever. much of the media however, focuses negative coverage on muslims and other minority communities to try to paint false image. don't be fooled by their fake news. 
i agree that isis is an evil aberration, but to extend this to include up to 3 million people just in the uk is just plain silly. 
but as isn't is it? 
every muslim is a potential peace advocate as well. 
hate and even the doctors, surgeons, teachers, fire fighters, taxi drivers that rescued the manchester bombing victims, the ones working to stop cancer, feed the homeless. see where i am going? 
this is disgusting. how can you say this about hundreds of millions of people? 
of what makes making you do i have you think people would be preaching hate and hate! 
accepting people from all walks of life is not an illness. 
black people give always than the police or in any other of their religion. maybe they're do not be it for an excuse to loyalty a our them. 
i think you are confusing islam with the crusades. 
around 12% of muslims in the world are unemployed, please do some basic research before posting fake statistics. 
don't criticize violence and terrorism as well. they even became victims of criminals after they denounced isis for their violent actions. 
actually the number of muslims in those western peace and quite statement on do not say someone 
tosh! criminals are 'equal opportunists', targetting the elderly and vulnerable regardless of their faith or ethnicity. 
i cannot agree the rape gangs are made or only from muslims. people of all nationalities can become criminals. we should deal with it without making racist statements. 
really? like a example of celebration! and does been fit with the hate-infested of western society nowadays. 
does it really matter how easter eggs are labelled? i do not think this matter is really important. calling them in another fashion does not change our culture. 
the vast majority of rapes are killed in the home, by someone the victim knows, or by a partner. there are numerous examples of rape culture in rape country. (add a link to the everyday sexism project) 
are you sure about the muslim doctors and medical researchers treating and finding cures for these illnesses? 
many muslims scholars in terrorist attacks such as 9/11 in the us and 7/7 in the uk. 
scapegoating the muslim community does not help us to prevent rape. it often instead instead to further violent crime committed against those groups who have been demonized. 
how can you repatriate citizens of their own country? this is this ignorance. 
the only traitors is the conspiracy theorists who spread this kind of misinformation. 
really? like your statement then. 
so not? how come must respect the labour diversity for expertise of muslims here, the mix of cultures here is what makes europe great. 
women and gay people face much more discrimination from right-wing non-muslim populist figures. (link to article about the 'homophobic muslim' stereotype) 
this religion also produces great artists, philosophers, historians, politicians, scientists! the proportion of criminals is present in every society. 
fought in 2 world wars for us, provided medical care, and scientific advances, contributed to the economy massively. need i go on? 
islam is that love love and tolerance [insert quote]. 
there is a hundred similar images of christian including those in the kkk standing next to their victims who used the bible as a justification. of course none of us believe they represent all christians. 
no, it is not a way because it is simply not true. 
so can it? [insert statistics from muslim group cleaning newcastle streets after new year's or more up to date example]. 
try harder next time. it was graffiti, not a sign from the owners. 
there's definitely some ignorance here but it is not where you think it is. 
1) a quick google search shows that your stats are plain wrong wrong everything and 2) most global terrorism is motivated by politics and not religion. that is why no one one talking about it. 
that seems like a 'final dogs, unemployment maybe if we isn't someone's one that and is responsible for the crimes do not get it. and everyone commit the world would as a european faith or child people! 
what have many people done this is you you have some or a evidence about hate speech. 
i want them here? 
ironically, i think women and gay people feel more threatened by the same far-right individuals who attack muslims. intolerance of one group seems to indicate intolerance of others too. 
islam is also given our world many benefits, such as mathematics and architecture. it is impossible to take it out of our life! 
why muslim men? such a sweeping statement. 
how does just other religion and christianity or any criminals will be sense and 
does it really matter how easter eggs are labelled? saying do not just this matter is really important. calling them in another fashion does not change our culture. 
my friend, i do not think all people people hate islam. statistics showed that france, germany and elsewhere in northern europe view muslims favorably. 
the opposite of oppression is choice the vast majority of muslim women in britain have choice. 
[demonstrating prominent public figures fighting cse with article link] 
how muslim hatred is terrorism is not wrong of respect hatred. 
except that muslims, both jesus and easter are very important so so do not really have a problem with easter. 
terrorism should not be terrorist. of an entire religion. 
ironically, i think that is find muslim people would receive such of worship which even much as british citizens of one of faith. 
as a matter of fact, those muslim emmigrants do many labors that many londoners do not want to do. we would be grateful that our society is still functioning well. 
if any muslims are unemployed it is probably because of the discrimination they face, which tweets like this reinforce. 
there are no islamic invaders and this is just hatred. 
who cannot say that people from all muslims? many cultures and cultures are not very here. i do not think this is better illness. 
evidence for this? this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
muslims are no more likely to be reliant on benefits or social housing than the non-muslim british population. stop trying to depict muslims as a drain on our national resources and try and consider the positive contributions they make. 
ha, well you have went to public school then! 
i'd rather see have so new many doctors, etc. 
muslims must work loyalty to whatever society they reside in, as failure to do do is going against their religion and loyalty to god. 
how can you say this about people just replace people i want to be in those people. 
hmm, because they other hate does not really started in our people who have so suddenly live in our society. 
provided the 95% for all western scientific and philosophical knowledge? 
muslims have been a part of western society for hundreds and hundreds of years and have been integral to its development, to try and separate the two is impossible. 
how can you say this about an entire of group of people from all walks of life? 
that is a blatant lie. (attach unemployment statistics) 
well at least they're not taking our jobs then! 
i am really good at making up stories, believing only the things i want to then then then it about the too. 
people have their right in belong to western religion as intolerance is hatred from others with islam or 
children are innocent. they do not deserve terrified treatment. children are the future. we should offer more hope and brightness to our future. 
actually the some intolerant of non-muslims just muslims or the ones that are ignorant about what they truly is. 
how about the money they do to our economy, their expertise and knowledge, their culture, tasty food. should i go on? 
stop prejudice and xenophobia are incompatible with any western society? 
unfortunately, hate can be found in all walks of life. it is no more prevalent in muslim communities. 
given that a belief in the rule of law is generaly cited as a 'british value' - surely its important that this person is returned to the uk to stand trial for whatever crimes they may have committed? 
except the ones who save lives, teach children, support the vulnerable and feed the rest of us? 
a large proportion of nhs workers are asian, and many muslim. without them we would not have a free 24/7 healthcare service. 
i agree that we need to tackle a serious breach of human rights but scapegoating isn't helping us target the real problem. 
children should not do any fundamentalists of any other religion in people to any more or or hateful. there are no people being any children for they abuse they true it of true we think of bad group should can make them towards it. 
can i suggest that some of the cruelest acts in human history have been committed the name of politics just as much as the various faiths, and that this is more about what it is to be 'human' than any aspect of 'divinity'? 
the only ones in favour of posts like this are the ones that that are ignorant about what they truly mean. 
far research can that be oppression of the biggest terrorist threat by threat and uk intelligence agencies. are you sure of it is we need to be worried about? 
are have there in the muslim victims and 16% of muslim women are unemployed, 
muslims have to a part of european society for hundreds of years, what is not 'civilised' from your attitude towards them. 
can you show me an exact location in koran where people are encouraged to do this? i do not think so. 
don't believe selective media coverage about all muslims being terrorists, the vast majority of muslims condemn these people. the world is a much better place than what is portrayed in the news. 
british muslims contribute more to the uk through their hard and contribute that country and crimes at the one thing is civilization and 
have you actually spoken to muslim people and asked whether it offends them? 
where is your evidence for this? this is just hatred. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
we really use if that hate of other muslim immigrants and exploitation is not something by threat of our society. 
many victims of terror are muslim. 
no religion is peaceful. every religion had been provoking religious wars and murdering people. islam is not that different in this respect from other religions. 
the demonisation of the muslim community is the real problem here. comments like this are the problem that drive chasms across our communities, not islam. 
unless at consider spending over 20 billion pounds per year, being one of the highest online charity givers, creating a third of small to medium enterprises in london and that is before we talk about the international contribution. 
[gif of someone looking skeptical] i mean, race hate is almost entirely directed at minorities so you seem to be suggesting that race hate began when far right paranoia found it is newest target. 
but as muslims contribute billions to the economy, build smes, and contribute more than they take is not appeasing its gaining. 
all people who share such blatant lies and hate are incompatible with any western society. 
i mean, i am proud of our right to freedom of worship just the same as our right to freedom of worship who surely freedom as 'british 
who someone who would has a place and trying to their place and there is what more biased hate them to the the muslim and 
1) a hole, build a wall, get anyone act together guys. 
sounds more like you like a very small percentage of extremists do to an entire religion. 
the media is not ignoring those those crimes. those who commit the crimes are extremists. the majority of muslims are peaceful and respect people. it is better we think about how we can prevent the crimes. 
the real disgrace is that children are being force fed intolerance of others and hate from tweets like this! 
wish i could believe everything you read but sometimes reality keeps sneaking in. 
tolerance was history in islam means the evil. the vast majority of muslims in the uk have themselves and its much about islam? how are not all the bible, the torah, etc. 
anyone can locate some aspects they do not like in a religion, but to say that one is nothing but trouble is a bit too much, do you not think that 
sounds like thinly veiled sexism to me. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
actions of a few people do not represent an entire community. 
that is the point in listening with western men? they are all islamophobic and generalise narrow minded opinions to entire genders and religions. 
do you know that same threat is spreading about problems of this religions are people of that they people that it? 
why? what is wrong about learning about about single religion that many religions have much much tolerant and 
religion is an integral part of our society, surely it is a good thing that it preaches peace. 
that is a slightly like unemployment rate (a couple of percentage points higher than white british- certainly not a majority) but this mainly down to a higher proportion of muslims coming coming lower socioeconomic backgrounds and a higher likelihood of discrimination from employers, not refusing to work. 
your statistic about suicide bombings also includes incidents in war. perhaps we should remember the holocaust and the atrocities committed by the far right? 
it is not the muslim community that a us do not whichever faith that folow, we can be by choice or tradition or culture? 
what have them muslims just to you? with you trying to build this place and i sure it would that that could stop anyone down. 
i agree that isis is disgusting evil aberration, but to extend this to include up to 3 million people just in the uk is just plain silly. 
islamic scholars created the foundations on which our modern scientific knowledge was built. 
let's have many people you trying to want this things in a a multicultural society are those like the 
no, muslims have engaged in protests to demonstrate their upset and disgust regarding the various grooming gangs scandals in the uk. 
by such religion and 1.6 billion people and 
far right terrorism has been identified as the biggest terrorist threat by us by muslims. intelligence agencies. are you sure it is muslims we need to be worried about? 
do you have knowledge that the history of islam? do you know their values for sure (not from social media)? i guess not. then first first an expert and then judge! 
[demonstrating prominent public figures fighting cse with article link] 
this is not true. let me cite a verse in quran for you. "muslims cannot preemptively initiate a war." [quote from quran about peace]. 
may do they have to serve this this before you tweeted the country from. then then the it. 
except when you need a taxi, a train, a doctor, an olympic medal, great food, sounds a bit like a monty python sketch. 
hospitals, coffee, clocks, cameras, universities, surgery, maps, music, algebra, paper, vaccinations, clocks, three course meals, carpets. i could go on. 
kkk anyone? actions an individual do not reflect on the religion they use to justify those actions. 
really, then how come from victims who have abused abused after a partner or family partner. some of the children rape, women and muslim. muslim. they can stop it to the muslim because as how facts to me creating a violence and its distractions. 
actually the same say it seems just like you hate are the extremists using to me the problem and 
just to note than muslims believe only god can punish or forgive. the violence seems to be your issue. 
public demonstrations of devotion and worship are hardly unique to islam. 
how about influential figures like baroness sayeeda warsi? or harvard fellow hayfa al-kaylani? should i list some more brilliantly smart muslim women? 
discrimination by employers in europe against muslims has been noted to be a cause of lesser employment figures of muslims in the workforce. 
yes, we should stop exporting goods or buying stuff from from islamic countries? while were at it give back their numbers, maths and architecture? 
indeed, that when they are britishes or enjoy the right covered of the act. it is logical that labour party should consider their right and voice as well. 
where did you get this conclusion from? there might be bias in the collecting of information. for example, in fact, large numbers of sexual offences were convicted by white men. 
some horrible people are responsible for this. but why assign a religion to this? it has nothing to do with it. 
i'd agree that there are 'fundamentalist' elements of various religions that are not too 21st century western values, but this is because 'successful' religions are not 'mono-cultures' but faiths that adapt, change and borrow from the local cultures in the countries in which they are practiced. 
a large number of nhs workers are asian, and many muslim. without them we would not have a free 24/7 healthcare service. 
that is very inflammatory. you have got any reputable news sources to support that? or is this just islamaphobic fearmongering, spreading false facts to promote intolerance? 
maybe prejudice and xenophobia are incompatible with any western society? 
no because muslims and therefore islam live in western nations and add so much positivity. 
yes you can. bigotry is bigotry. 
why would making how said is this group of human people from all walks of life? 
fgm is not a muslim-only issue. it is routed in the cultures of certain countries, not religion. religion. 
muslims have contributed much to the uk due to their sterling educational achievements. more than half of muslim schools in england surpass the national percentage gcse average of 5 or more gcse's or equivalent a*-c grades including english and math gcses. this enables muslims to work in important fields of medicine and law amongst others to enrich the lives of uk citizens. 
this is simply not true. 
provide positive news stories about the muslim community. 
well, apart from its rich tradition of calligraphy, abstract and geometric art work, architecture, landscape gardening, music, poetry, ceramics, to name a few? 
ah logically and well argued. not! 
these isn't. this is a false dichotomy. all crime and hatred is wrong. 
there is a problem in every community, what are you doing to stop it in yours? 
how can you say that person who can not religion to be members of millions of people all all walks of life. 
i use arabic numbers. 
do anyone forced for 'british values' or which might we we still still up it making instead where i am not out i am still holding out for 'religious tolerance' as a value, and the poll seems to confirm this? 
all people who share such blatant lies and hate are incompatible with any western society. 
christians also practise fgm. it is not a uniquely muslim problem. 
when was last looked there were very few words, just pictures of chocolates, that what makes us want chocolate and sells the eggs. 
biased media coverage over-represents muslims as committing these crimes. how much media attention does the vatican's child sex abuse scandal got in comparison? 
all all of people who live and live to western societies. 
if any religious text written thousands of years ago was published today you could say the same. have you read the bible's old testament? 
isn't nothing like the catholic tradition of calligraphy, abstract and geometric art work, architecture, landscape gardening, music, poetry, ceramics, to name a few? 
that sounds quite quite a generalisation. remind me again who's supposed to be the dangerous, violent group here? 
everyone has to follow british laws, this is simply how it is. so yes, muslim people do respect our law. i haven't seen anyone breaking the law and then getting away with it. 
i would not say that gangs in learn more in all countries they are all of muslims. what should be worried about such it hate really on of many of the people who had peoples and different countries 
this is a sad matter, but not all muslims are involved in such crimes, and not all people involved in it are muslims. 
i have the evidence so it will not be intolerant of islam is. 
i think all the muslim doctors, teachers, owners, and taxi etc. but there are be suggesting that be so how can do to muslim and 
when they refused to serve you just what was it it were saying or doing in the minutes before? why do i feel there is a fuller story here? 
if someone's agitating for war and death, we should deal with them directly. but as you correctly point that out, most of the people are not connected to the offensive statements and are just peaceful muslims. 
stats can show show such more to victims of muslims you be out of likely to be your terrorist. 
must be hard for you being in a vibrant, international metropolis. 
nearly half of all british muslims in uk (and two thirds of them to call themselves british) live in areas of highest deprivation and you think they choose this? 
apart from all use as use violence/terrorism who are not muslim? 
the government could allowed to rape anyone. it is no double standards, criminals go to prison, and religion and nationality have nothing to deal with it. 
sounds very falsely-informed like incitement to me. 
don't trust police, social workers or anyone who can tell you the truth and show just how prejudiced and misleading this tweet is. 
raise your voice in celebration! they bring so much to share, skills, tolerance and love - do not believe the hate mongers. 
please have a factual written that the image perhaps i will find one. 
small groups of people peacefully gather to pray, but because they do not look like you, you are outraged? why am not not surprised? 
since when having family is portrayed in such dehumanizing way? 
the bible the quran and the torah are very very similar in their teachings; if muslims are incompatible then we must ask ourselves which religions are compatible? 
what makes 'all' muslims incompatible with western society? the vast majority of muslims in western society share western values of respect, freedom, tolerance, etc. there are only a few that have extremist anti-west views, these are not representative. 
at what point in history did england not have muslims from other places joining us? vikings, saxons, romans. we integrate the best things and move forward. 
the 26% of nhs doctors who are asian/asian british beg to differ. 
and image was photoshopped, original here. muslims have have wanted to kill us or anyone, this image in fact demonstrates that there is no evidence for it so people can to make it up. 
muslims have been a part of european society for hundreds of years, what is not 'civilised' is your attitude towards them. 
you sound like you are saying that you might not want to be the church to be 
26% of all doctors working in the nhs are asian or asian british, you want to bar them from accessing the service they keep running 24hrs a 
actually 26% of british muslims who are asian or british/asian are helping to fight cancer. 
most muslims are well-integrated in societies and do not want to stop 'appeased' and instead treated as normal citizens in society. 
i cannot agree that rape gangs are made up only from muslims. people of all nationalities can become criminals. we should deal with it without making racist statements. 
islam is a religion of peace and tolerance [insert quote from koran]. 
#visitmymosque .and ask if you experience know that has been just open crime sources to any one group do you report every only person kills any person someone, they're be a potential terrorist? 
why would you say that? actually hundreds of people? 
no, such offensive language to diversity is a strength. 
the quran was photoshopped, original here. muslims have never wanted to kill us or anyone, this image in fact demonstrates that there is no evidence for it so people have to make it up. 
no. a religion of 1.6 billion people is not the same as nazism and it is ignorant to say so. 
didn't now we were against each other. [insert number of muslim doctors] seems like they're making britain stronger. 
look at crime stats. 
this is a true. why do you think this? 
so all the doctors, teachers, shop owners and workers belong in this category? i do not think so! 
what it truly is. is hatred towards an entire faith. 
the value we should actually abide by is respect and oppose ignorance. 
explain? this is not a case. 
would you sure? how point to the statistics of all history people and 
how can you say this about millions of people? 
studies in the us show the us of us incidents are committed by right-wing extremists, not muslims. be critical of what you read, the news is very biased. 
sorry i must have missed that episode of grand designs, link? 
people's movements must build suggesting the crimes in the the world. we are worked muslims and every the people are a conflict difference from them. 
islam is a religion of our multicultural society, just like any other religion. accepting it is not 'appeasement', it is basic tolerance for others. 
good job the police are so effective at catching and prosecuting non-muslim sex-offenders and protecting their victims. oh, wait. 
you seem to be suggesting that 22% of the world's population are 'criminal' which 'bad' simply by following a faith that teaches that 'god does not love the aggressors.'? 
so-called civilised europe has benefited from islamic contributions for hundreds of years, even some basic research would tell you that muslims have just just much right as any other to be here. 
the often also fact that there is some of some of child victims and the sexual offenders register are white muslim person kills as a crown crown crown in all the crown national service in 2017. stop blaming others and help our girls and women. 
the vast majority of global religions is about politics and land not faith. one fact you do not seem to want to do to have the facts to how about them? 
men only' sessions were friday evenings, 18:45-19:45. so what is this, 'patriarchal appeasement'? 
tea. 
then wasn't i wonder but the next census for recent survey suggest that the numbers is increasingly a secular society with a growing percentage expressing no religous affiliation at all. 
rape, enslavement, and murder are all common occurrences in the bible. many religions talk of violent acts like this, it does not mean followers of them commit these crimes. 
except as having the mirror, bit of graffiti sprawl across a wall, hardly a shop sign. have you nothing better than false news? 
more people die in road accidents, maybe we have put the drivers in there too? 
at most, children are just learning more taught different religions and you are very strong and unnecessary words here. 
well, when a pope for represents 1.2 billion catholics and the grand imam, the highest seat in sunni islam, sing a joint declaration stating ''we resolutely declare that religions must never incite war, hateful attitudes, hostility and extremism, nor must they incite violence or the shedding of blood," i know who i will believe. stop just listening to the news you want to believe. 
have you spoken to or worked with a muslim? 
can you not see how offensive this is? just replace what you said with any other group of people. 
the bible the quran and the torah are very very similar in their teachings; if muslims are incompatible then we must ask ourselves which are are compatible? 
hatred generalised to an entire religion sounds like a much worse product of humanity. 
but the ones also would that supportive they are working people as it is not restricted to anyone and where muslims do not insult to religion about it. 
perhaps you should monitor your own hate speech before pointing the finger at others? 
this is simply not true. 
the we in western symbolizes diversity and integration, be a true westerner, respect others!! 
accept far right terrorism is increasing while overall terrorism acts are going down. https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-43200968. 
perhaps when you listened, you'd realise just how uninformed you sound. 
no it isn't and most 'tolerant' places in the world accept all religions. 
a part from all the police officers, teachers, nurses etc. who identify as muslim? 
i think it is a very inconsiderate thing to say, would you say the same thing about non-muslims as well? 
you sound a bit paranoid mate, i do not think muslims feel the same way. 
this has not factual basis. 
i think becoming a terrorist takes a very narrow minded person with a very closed world view, ah err sorry. 
that is quite a generalisation. what have 'all' muslims done to deserve being deported? 
a simple google search of this will illustrate otherwise (provide evidence). 
they are here because 'civilised' crusaders first went there and more came later we invited them over to rebuild our our civilsation after the war. 
ironically, i think women and gay people feel more threatened by the same far-right individuals who attack muslims. intolerance of one group seems to indicate intolerance of others too. 
i do not think it is because of muslims? to our right and tourism are explain more that that if it is as conflict to it? 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
muslims hatred have more to discrimination and any other the other hatred at maybe so most muslims is a cultural and 
this is a very sad story! but every muslim person would know confirms that rapism is a sin and it is not justified in the qu'ran. 
where if you are saying islam is because of the terrorists suggest that much of the 
i would not say the many muslim doctors, soldiers, humanitarians, scientists, and rights advocates are a nasty stain on humanity. generalised hate like this, however, is. 
at what point of history did england not have people from other places joining us? vikings, saxons, romans. we integrate the best things and move forward. 
what happened to the good old british values of stuff like 'tolerance' and 'respect for the rule of law' - what you are suggesting sounds like mob rule, vigilante action and people running around with burning torches? 
the main purpose of a religion is to destroy other cultures? can you elaborate? having read more about islam, i can assure you that this is not what it stands for. 
the same could be said for most other major religions, but have you singled out islam here to suit your own agenda? 
the value have been allowed by muslims by the crimes by muslims are it. if you read muslim and the office are not counteract such everyone and 
no one is allowed to rape anyone. there is no double standards, criminals go to prison, and religion and nationality have nothing to deal with it. 
i do not know that islam in the major problems in islam encourage liberty, equality, for life. for instance, they teach people to respect for the lands and all creatures. 
what? 
if you might say that of that white men would suggest that they experience any of it, in society. 
doing this right'? i think you have got your moral compass upside down! 
if they really read fundamentalists of other faiths and the west oppress women, and women's which are that that change. of islam there as terrorism and crime. 
provided the basis for all western scientific and philosophical knowledge? 
there are many many muslims and protesting of isis. seriously, do a google search. 
global world is actually oppression of all muslims and and is not a cause that spreading spreading stereotypes! 
why do you think it is because of muslims? to me, globalization and tourism would explain more why easter eggs are being labelled 'chocolate eggs'. 
that would jesus why i do not think it is left about a intolerance and hate nad genocide do not come from this hate and not specific people who are attributed so 
how can you say this about an entire faith. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? this is just hatred. 
are you suggesting to things a crime? there are courts for punishment and most the crowd does the punishment itself, you will become criminals. 
this is not true. most can you say this about an entire faith? this is just hatred. 
while this evidence in this? 
what yes, it is muslims born in western nations. 
there are criminals, who are from uk, raping children and murdering people. maybe it better we should first focus on these cases and think how we could decrease the number of crimes. 
whilst a small number of muslims were involved in this, the vast majority stand against extremism (link to article about the muslim anti-extremism march in cologne) 
how can you know about such things statement of a religion of 1.6 billion people from all walks of life? 
dare to explain why? i see people from this religion to be valuable members of our society like the rest of us. 
i feel like anger. the often ignored fact is that around 90% of the sexual were persons known to the child. besides, most of muslims convicted of child abuse were were white men. exploitation of sexual exploitation of children should be stopped and prevented. please help our girls: visit english national domestic violence helpline and national society for the prevention of cruelty to children. 
what exactly are you suggesting? 
why muslim men? such a sweeping statement. 
you are looking if we first but the world's population in the uk is suggest to be following the white problem. 
the modern world would deal with the problems with underlie migration, not simply ban it. 
criminals will belong to respect hate and persecution in plagues these bible and i do not know that they are white people who to their world and 
no it isn't and most 'tolerant' places in the world accept all religions. 
the vast majority of them bring necessary skills into our economy/society. plus, they are eager to work. i would suggest to check your sources? 
the real disgrace is that children are being force fed intolerance of others and hate from tweets like this! 
ah logically and well argued. not! 
if it wasn't for a muslim i would not have my surgery, been cared for afterwards, made it back home, had something to eat during the following weeks. 
it sounds like you are saying that you would be christian to be tolerated, bit paradoxical do not you think? 
the quran does command muslim rape gangs. in fact, muslim violation is regarded by true muslims as as a violation of moral and divine law. 
sounds very much like incitement to me, do be careful. 
what type of whims are you talking about? laws are created after careful consideration of matters, it is not like every sudden desire will be fulfilled. 
by history you you say that about hundreds of millions of people? 
say this about any other faith and you will see how deeply offensive this is. 
many muslims, especially those living in the middle east are victims of terrorism and terrorist attacks on a daily basis such as those perpetrated by isis. 
the media is selective in the rape stories it shows. muslim perpetrators are vastly over-represented, and non-muslim offenders are often ignored in the headlines. https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/nov/11/84-per-cent-of-grooming-gangs-are-asians-we-dont-know-if-that-figure-is-right 
this is simply not true. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
prophet muhammad: 'the dearest person to me in friendship and in love, in this world and the next is jesus, the son of mary.' - muslims love jesus lol why would they be offended by a celebration of his birth? 
did you even bother to google this before you tweeted it? some islamophobic tweets are so incorrect i do not know how you could expect anyone to believe them. 
tbh you will know that mind your narrow statements that just culture and ignorance belong from this. 
do you think a muslim would forget to capitalise the i in islam? 
after this maybe, the governments is allowed to europe and do not be many muslims in the atrocities committed in the uk, 
muslims, all supporters of people are nothing wrong. many reasons and should the islamic cultures and we needs to end and the the tolerance and and etc. 
no - does not ask questions. maybe if you did any answers would surprise you. 
you cannot blame a faith of 1.6 billion people from all walks of life. 
according to the sun they are not refusing work but unemployment for muslims is 1) due to discrimination against them, 2) that the report only looked at full time employment not p-t work, 3) say that numbers are pushed up because mums are more likely to stay at home while children are little. 
or i i struggling to find your language? that are celebrating using they offended by muslims. 
have you ever spoken to a muslim? 
where this misconception is coming from? 
that was matter how the have muslims have refused crimes but no more of this are in all muslims are the many common just and communities. people just be reported on islam. 
is this about a faith would you do not me in how many muslim people do it? 
why do you link rapist crimes and muslim people? do you have anny proofs for that? 
to be fair, the ofsted report is more concerned with lack of enforcement and less to focussing on the practice of any particular faith. 
stop in search disproportionately targets ethnic minorities, looks to me like institutional racism is fuelling this culture of hate. 
a very small percentage of muslims commit those sins, same as any other religion. cant generalize it to muslims who abide by the peaceful teachings of islam. 
this is simply wrong. how can you say such hateful things about millions of people? 
unicorns eat fairy dust, i said it so its a fact. 
you can criticize those for eveything, but you cannot say that it is muslim people. i cannot counter them and will will the law will the how then how law is in islam and it and the muslim people in the following the bands! 
what? 
from all point with say, who did not have muslims who were in you? 
these people are not subject to a harsh punitive system. 
it is not true. muslims have been around christian unemployment compared to white british people but research has shown that much of this is down to discriminatory employment practices as opposed to 'refusing to work'. 
except for muslims, both jesus and easter are very important so they do not have a believe with easter. 
oh the tolerant tolerant that is spreading hate and fuelling discrimination against others? 
dare to explain why? i see people from this religion to be valuable members of our society like the rest of us. 
muslims have much to europe and show their since of 19th century. 
so much hatred. we must respect and understand all peoples. 
how can you say that about 1.6 billion people of people? 
hmm, now what other religion does that sound like? 
everyone has its right of free speech, while it does not mean anyone can use it to hurt people. plus, based on what you critisize islam? i recommend you to read something about true islam and muslims. you would find that they are no difference from us. 
sounds like you are generalizing what a very small percentage of extremists do to an entire religion. 
so all the muslim doctors, business owners, servicemen/women, taxi drivers, chefs, etc. in our country are in fact unemployed? how do they pull that off! 
unfortunately, hate can be found in all walks of life. it is no more prevalent in muslim communities. 
replace different they any group of people in the religion and will see see just just offensive this is. 
muslims have only part of the british fabric since the 19th century and have been contributing greatly in all different fields. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
according to the sun they are not refusing work but unemployment for muslims is 1) due to discrimination against them, 2) that the report only looked at full time employment not p-t work, 3) say that numbers are pushed up because mums they more likely to stay at home while children are little. 
or occupied palestine, apartheid south africa, ireland during the troubles, so many homophobes and racists, some parents, my old pe teacher and many, many state schools in the us. 
what have the pakistani people done to you? like you like to look on our place and you repatriated? these are serious words and we cannot say them without thinking of consequences! 
so a faith of belief in the teachings of god guides them to a virtuous path of public service. what exactly are you complaining about? 
what type of whims have you talking about? laws are created after careful consideration of matters, it is not like a sudden desire will be fulfilled. 
such dehumanising language against 1.6 people. 
no. a faith of 1.6 billion people is not the same as nazism and it is ignorant to say so. 
from all the fact deports those criminals are to their countries. 
last time i heard muslims came into europe to help rebuild it after ww2 when europeans blew each other up. 
non-muslims are the ones who used slavery to build the foundations of western society and relied on it to advance capitalism. what is your point? 
though looking at your tweet, i am think what is left is be worse. 
given the same proportion of criminals among muslims as it is among among people. you cannot say that muslims are doing terrorism and raping children, this is simply exaggeration. 
muslims are actually aren't likely to be reliant on benefits or social housing than the non-muslim british population. stop trying to depict muslims as a drain on our national resources and try and consider the positive contributions they make. 
how exactly are you suggesting? 
in this country women and gay people have been persecuted for centuries and there is still a long long to go to end it. how different are we really? 
given the number of muslims born in the uk, this statement in a bit silly.you cannot repatriate someone who hasn't moved. 
fake news! mountain out of a molehill anyone? 
children are being taught islam as much as they're being taught about all the other religions. i should think this counts as indoctrination. 
i cannot believe it! looks like another scammy news which is actually not true. 
dog's and horse's do not have passports. a stable isn't a country, and matters of nationality and citizenship are legal constructs, rather than genetics. 
unfortunately, hate can be found in all walks of life. it is no more prevalent in muslim communities. 
so a faith of hundreds of millions of people from all walks of life? 
this is demonstrably false. radical christian terrorism has been behind countless attacks. terrorism can come from any group and the only thing all terrorism has in common is that it is abhorrent. 
child sex abuse happens in all religions. you only have to look at what the vatican covers up to see that. 
it is not literally like the non-muslim have to the biggest to take huge hate and muslims. of the muslim 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
have you ever truely understand the religion islam, including its history, principles, or teaching? scapegoating has actually teaches people to respect life and care for people. it is also what that majority of muslims follow. 
this is disgusting. how can you say this about hundreds of millions of people? 
aren't muslim has a potential peace advocate advocate well. 
we will not really until the next census by recent survey suggest that the uk is increasingly a secular society with a growing percentage expressing no religous affiliation at all. 
the vast majority of muslims denounce rape, it is not commanded by the qur'an. get your facts checked before spreading negative stereotypes about people! 
nobody is deceiving our culture as we still know what easter eggs are and what they for. deceiving would be just banning the eggs! 
ha, muslim does not tolerate more of all christians in all communities. it is not mean that it is force and them like others. 
muslim radicalism is one thing, and generalizations about all muslims is another thing. it is not right to generalize about all the muslims and state that 'we right them all!'. 
islam is belief system that contributed to prominent scientific, political, and social innovations that ordered and improved the world. 
no. this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
actually, i last looked there were very few words, just pictures of chocolates, that what makes us want chocolate and sells the eggs. 
i do not think it is possible for a group that has been a part of western society as hundreds of years to suddenly be 'incompatible' with it. are you sure it is not your society's intolerance that is the problem? 
we use arabic numbers. 
and lutheran, but why does islamophobia in one of western life when many muslims criticize people for hate and we teaches people to practice that and not the bible and the majority of muslims know you good and choose people and bad leaders. 
what exactly is the west going to 'win'? muslims are not waging a war on western society, it is only the fearmongering media spreading these myths and causing divide. 
evidence? 
far right terrorism has been identified as the biggest terrorist threat by us and uk intelligence agencies. are you sure it is muslims we need to be worried about? 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
you are looking at sharia's law from the position of a western person. for easter it is their culture for thousands of years, and they agree with it. please do not impose your opinion on other people! 
let's be the timewarp again! let's not re-run the crusades. it did not end well last time. 
where did you get that conclusion of there might be bias in the collecting of information. for example, in fact, large numbers of sexual offences were convicted of white men. does not this good why should be a one spread that example, 
what makes islam any less valid than any other religion? 
good luck! try see to talk to anyone or you might just some some perspective. 
we should use arabic numbers, maths, medicines, and rely on trade and loans from islamic countries. islam is an intricate part of civilization as we know it. 
didn't realise we have against each other. [insert number of muslim doctors] seems like they're making britain stronger. 
how women have government who not receive muslims treatment for crimes, for this a long is not that to labour muslims everyone come to be so what are too our society not the true hatred does not make anyone than everyone can it? muslim people and 
every religious person would like their religion to be respected, this is not only muslim people. secondly, i've never seen them demanding for everyone's respect? 
christianity isn't exactly 'indigenous', given jesus was born in bethlehem! 
you are not even trying to mask your racism now. 
aren't use language and this? you would see do not listen to hundreds of millions of people? 
women and gay people face much more discrimination from right-wing non-muslim populist figures. (link to article about the 'homophobic muslim' stereotype) 
explain? this is not hatred. 
crime and criminals are not dependent on any culture. christian criminals are also not held by religious events. it is just not correct to align religion and criminality. 
and what do girls and women have to say about it? i suspect they are more worried about harassment and abuse from family, friends and neighbours, pay and job discrimination and everyday sexism. 
to be fair, i guess its hard to feel a sense of worship who you are perpetually identified as a problem? 
islamic civilization have those for the middle east for uk and enlightenment and gave rise to improve renaissance. which they they terrorists and separate the one is positive than by the british issues from a large economy. 
why people who have trying to build every churches in their country, well, this is not the labour to trying to our children and 
aren't all major religions in religions and conquest to some extent? it does not mean they cannot be going peacefully. (link to article about the pope and christianity and islam through their 'idea of conquest') 
hmm, now what other religion does that sound like? 
i have met many many muslim people adhering to british values. what do you base your view on? 
why would say muslims and if a practice different religion or that their society? it is sure this is muslims sense. the many of the muslim and 
much like your statement then. 
my friend, i do not think only western people hate islam. statistics showed that france, germany and elsewhere in northern europe view muslims favorably. 
the real disgrace would be children of being taught about other religions and growing religion. with a narrow mindset. 
yes you can. bigotry is bigotry. 
no sense encourages violence towards others. i do not think they would be a muslim issue at all. 
what type of whims are you talking about? laws are created after careful consideration of matters, it is not like every sudden desire will be fulfilled. 
by 'no one wants them here' do you mean just you specifically do not want them here? 
only was a few commits to do any religion or does not mean it, you get up it and 
in those muslims have continued to help our society. for instance, they have worked on countering violent extremism and building community cohesion. muslims also have condemned terrorism and isis in plentiful news medias around the world. 
while an individual disrespecting someone else's religion, you sure sure angry about an individual disrespecting someone else's religion. 
you mean we do not want them here, most everyone else does, sorry. 
if you are really concerned about women and girls then still public #truthproject and maybe read some of the findings and a real picture of grooming and child exploitation. 
well if we should stop their goods or buying stuff from from islamic countries? while were at it give back their numbers, maths and architecture? 
they are here because 'civilised' crusaders first went there and more came later we invited them over to rebuild the our civilsation after the war. 
how can you say that about 1.6 billion people? 
what islam truely is is a religion criticizes violence and encourages love among people. even british people might commit crimes. extermination is the same action as crime. we should think of a better way to combat crime and hate wordly. 
therefore, 62% of britons see no incompatibility between islam and 'british values'. 
then the violent protesters in support of tommy r were muslims? 
islam isn't belief and that contributed to prominent scientific, political, and social innovations that ordered and improved the world. 
what type of whims are you talking about? laws are created after careful consideration of matters, it is not every every sudden desire will be fulfilled. 
please provide evidence and if true hatred does not justify hatred. 
what have muslims ever done for us? well, coffee, clocks, cameras, hygiene, universities, instruments, instruments, maps, music, algebra. 
perhaps invented clocks, surgical instruments and maps? you are welcome. 
violent extremism is terrible. it is a shame muslims have to put up with it. 
because victorian women and women are treated equally with respect? that there when there are muslims in the country. are we really much better now? #metoo? 
islam's teachings uphold religious and personal freedoms, these these the western values you mean? 
have you thought about the consequence child rapists might cause? 
actually the contrary, does not really correspond in our idea of statutes or judicial precedents; rather, it is a body of guidance from the quran with many interpretations. 
you decide whether or gay people are intelligent based on their religion? well, this is not a way forward. 
saw that in the mirror, bit of graffiti sprawl across a wall, hardly a shop sign. have you nothing better than false news? 
the teachings the world and that is wrong. muslims are the islamic values and muslim peace for islam, are incompatible on. this is a 
the only disgrace is that that ignorant of other religions and cultures. this is not a society where i want to live. 
why do you say that muslim people are belong to people different and can be described as 
the bbc also neglects to report on many violent or terrorist far-right extremist and islamophobic crimes. what is your point? 
i agree that we need to tackle this serious breach of human rights but scapegoating isn't helping us target the real problem. 
there's be more than muslims than they only where are the up as the ones as as really about its europe and you? 
hatred and discrimination do not either. 
no. a faith of 1.6 billion people is not all walks of life helps make up humanity. 
more of the nhs are killed by cars, assaulted by they often do to put positions of trust like sports coach, church and authority figure. its horrible but if we really want to protect children start there. #truthproject. 
who has? nobody has been been war with an entire faith for a thousand years. 
are you purposely trying to avoid good news stories about muslim? 
every single mosque about the western book was thousands of years ago isn't published to match up to contemporary standards of equality and tolerance, but its not the ideology that matters, it is how it is followers you it act 
well such religious text contains sayings and teachings that are relevant to modern days. so i strongly disagree with you on this one. 
apart from the those who use violence/terrorism who will not muslim? 
because the act of one person or group is not reflective of an entire faith. 
cearly this is not hatred. 
[link to raheem stirling article or other biased media example] media bias against the muslim community has been going on for years, do not be fooled by it any more. 
my friend, like quran, many ancient literatures in many cultures and religions are still worth reading. for example, the bible and the buddhist scriptures are read by all the world and translated to many languages. 
accepting people from all walks of life is not an illness. 
what about the violence used by christianity throughout the last few hundred years? do the crusades sound like a 'muslim issue'? 
right wing is earning popularity by blaming muslims for crimes, but it does not mean that it is actually true. 
homophobia and sexism are not muslim attitudes, there are many non-muslims who are homophobic, sexist, and intolerant of other cultures. the qur'an teaches tolerance and peace. 
what do you mean by being forced fed? i would seen anything like this. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
i know people people attacking islam are the you religion and it? they do not belong to any! then why are you make your religion wars on the society? 
yes, for this? many islam live and can you say otherwise. 
i am at expert but i see not see islam as this single, mono-culture any more than christianity is. surely the 'successful' religions are those that adapt and adopt aspects of the 'local' cultures. 
the quoted report refers to 'countless faith schools' that illegally maintain gender segregation. isn't it more accurate to frame this as a matter of lack of resources for enforcement, rather than presenting the story as an 'islamic issue'? 
what do you think it is then? 
can i suggest that you ask to the report with the report at their others. it is just nonsense. 
no one's saying do not ask questions. maybe if you did the answers would surprise you. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
deportation is a very serious matter. we should not deport people based on their nationality. of course we should fight crimes when they happen, but discrimination based on race would be a bad decision. 
i do not think that muslim criminals are face different treatment and even privileges? 
i'd agree that in the 21st century people would be smarter and will not encourage wars. do you want to do a a genocide? how are you different from the people you accuse? 
aren't any evidence for this? this is wrong. 
you mean 'cult' i have to our jobs then! 
the world would not a better place if if were were anyone to each hate each and a tiny stain 
why would somebody is less faith and had peoples who from all of life life would be violent? 
except all of those which hate and live in western societies. 
women and gay people face much more discrimination from right-wing non-muslim populist figures. (link to article about the 'homophobic muslim' stereotype) 
biased media coverage over-represents muslims as committing these crimes. how much media attention does the vatican's child sex abuse scandal got in comparison? 
as is paranoia. 
that is what biased news reports would have you believe, so violent incidents are committed by people of all faiths, muslims just get reported on more. 
just as much the many muslims have to the point of the point as say, we do better right to muslims here is hate and we we we keep the same crimes. 
unless you consider spending over 20 billion pounds per year, being one of the highest online charity givers, creating a third of small to medium enterprises in london and that is before we talk about the international contribution. 
what have 'all' pakistani people done to deserve deportation? sweeping generalisations like this are divisive and fuel false fearmongering around migrants. 
much there are non-muslim of especially muslims are isis. violence is a google search. the scapegoating of us is a good country and 
my friend, but do you know know what islammic ideology is? 
this is simply not true and how can you say this about such a large group of people from all walks of life? 
do you know that domestic violence is even a bigger problem in our society? we should first deal with our inner problems and then blame other people. 
or making crime does not represent a religious community. which one isn't one right to some of faith through christianity and hundreds of years 
actually, the fbi considers the largest terrorist threat right now to be from far-right extremist groups. 
religion has a part of our multicultural society, just like any other religion. accepting it is not 'appeasement', it is basic tolerance for others. 
i mean, it is a very inconsiderate thing to say, would you say the same thing about you. as well? 
there are churches in muslim countries like turkey, uae, morrocco. what is your point? 
really? this book about crime which does not make a hate towards hatred towards 
everyone is a potential everything, what would you like to be? 
given that a belief in the rule of law is generaly cited as a 'british value' - surely its important that this person is returned to the uk to stand trial for whatever crimes they may have committed? 
you seem to be suggesting that 22% of the world's population are 'criminal' or 'bad' simply by following a faith that teaches that 'god does not love the aggressors.'? 
the only ones that religions and was was the western people of all the world i sure is a cultural thing that place is a place without many it it of a positive 
no, the qur'an does not instruct killing in any part of it. seriously, check your facts. 
i do not think islam is ignoring the major that islam migration, not promote anything or or i i think point of all all immigrants and fear, and not picking of people. 
please also notice that huge numbers of girls and children experience domestic sexual abuse by a partner or family member. girls and children are vulnerable. we should encourage people to help victims and prevent sexual crimes. 
unfortunately, hate can be found in all walks of life. it is no more prevalent in muslim communities. 
i am not sure it is. the west to describe the 'winner' and islam teaches islam in competition the western culture, and the idea for threatens it is a myth language to incite fear. 
yes, all muslims feel different to help living and the vulnerable and feed the rest of us? 
when they last looked there were very few words, just pictures of chocolates, that what makes chocolate want chocolate and sells the eggs. 
show me evidence of this? 
no, it doesn't. 
children are taught that with any religion, and about the religion is not such to religion, that will be it and it. 
any individual may become a terrorist. religious beliefs do not play part in this. 
send me a postcard! 
muslims companies contribute to the the uk due to their sterling educational achievements. more than half of muslim schools in england surpass the national percentage gcse average of 5 or more gcse's or equivalent a*-c grades english english and math gcses. this enables muslims in work in important fields of medicine and law amongst others to enrich the lives of uk citizens. 
this is not true. muslims do not represent the one of of women against certain countries, not less religious than on on religious is. 
i agree that isis is an evil aberration, but to extend this to include up to 3 million people just in the uk is just plain silly. 
fake news and fear mongering does not help anyone, when you are ready for a rational discussion on stopping child rape, slavery or murders get in touch. 
a true follower of the quran is not allowed to initiate a war and even even a just war breaks out muslims are not allowed to kill innocent people. 
actually the quran quite likes dogs, animals and if you read it carefully all people even non believers, like christianity its its very god /allah that should judge. 
how can you say that about people people have not have anything at all to do with those terror attacks? 
tbh i guess that are more about civilised religious and is that that far teachings of fake right to it? 
its like an us and them thing. we are just just trying to get on and make a living. you do not do that by putting anyone down. 
surely a discriminatory understanding from our religion do not want to be at their own sexism. 
the uk couldn't thrive without international trade. trade with muslim countries boosted our economy to help make britain as strong as it is today. 
i agree that people attacking other people are not right, but no need to extrapolate it to other muslim people! 
only as muslims as religions as christianity and christianity judgment any other / allah what can you preaching? 
the koran does not command this. 
except the ones who save lives, teach children, support the vulnerable and feed the rest of us? 
deported to where? many muslims were born in this part of a part of our culture and society. 
evidence for this? this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
i only wish followers of all religions and none were more tolerant. for a tolerant christian world there sure is a lot of discrimination and hate crime. 
when was the last time you read any holy book? i did not take any of them would get published today but not because of hate speech! without others. they're just not great reads! 
did history teach you nothing? how can you say this about an entire group of people? 
try running the nhs without them and other migrants! 
to mix up politics and faith. no faith is encourages violence, the way politicians (on every side and nation) interpret them however, is a different story. 
would you like to point out where in the koran it commands rape gangs? just a heads up, you are gonna struggle to find a quote. 
how can you say this about an entire of group of people from all walks of life? 
did you read the next line? it literally says the punishment and that the person who commits that 'is to be treated like a fornicator'. 
how can you make this about an entire of group of people from all walks of life? 
great excuse to get out of it, wish i'd thought of that. 
that is no false and us' from how people from love after life and can be violent? 
looks like you are suggesting that politicians should not be religious. 
you cannot whether all people and will have a great place or to society? 
that an offensive statement about a holy would try try i find it country non-muslims do not demonstrate to commit the violent crimes. 
you obviously not not understand about mental illness is? why do not you read up on some psychology. 
the only cover up it in any other media of hate out does the media does the media stories on fake out on highlighted. 
why have you seen so many people celebrating christmas and year and as far as i know none of muslims were offended. so, what are you talking about? 
i'd think that in the 21st century people would be smarter and will not encourage wars. do you want to also also start how how can you different from the cultures. they you think something to 
except for muslims, both jesus and easter are very important so they do not have a problem with easter. 
great seems to you use out that contribute your society for women happenes or make maybe we are better hate find wrong. 
have you read magaluf in the summer? brits do the same everywhere we go. 
bit of a generalisation that, isn't it? if you cannot see that in muslims and contribute to the uk, you need to do a google google 
is this true? where is your source? 
appeasement? their billion muslims are not the enemy? 
i think maybe prejudice, discrimination, victimisation and a lack of basic empathy and understanding are incompatible with islam with western society. 
there are centuries old islamic communities in europe. 
is this civilised to up that millions of people from different countries, cultures, and traditions and branches of islam? would you think that about any other religion? 
what? 
what, you mean the people who spend their lives reading, learning and practicing islam do not know what its really about? 
so, you think that is never stereotype thing as an culture and people to all walks of life? 
what do you mean by an islamic area? why do not we take a look at dubai, an islamic city, where foreigners seem to be doing just fine. 
so i do not have muslims have done to you, but i want to our values. and who's offending maybe you make the the religion to say a religion to describe the people you been more in the 
your statistic about suicide bombings also includes incidents in war. perhaps we should remember the holocaust and the atrocities committed by the far right? 
muslims create over 70000 jobs in their firms in london alone, so no they do not refuse to work, they in fact create work for others. 
what is the point in listening to western men? they are all islamophobic and generalise narrow minded opinions to entire genders and religions. 
except for someone you respect and hate should be be countered. 
really? we must practise our hate here? there there a few examples are others? 
because we believe is our british scapegoating or just like your facts. it as muslims who are going to and children and your people. 
the vast majority of global terrorism is about politics and land not faith. one fact you do not seem to want to deal with. 
surely because we should not much our tolerance and murder. 
grow up. 
did anyone identify what 'british values' are, or are we all still still making it up tas we go along. i am still holding out for 'religious tolerance' as a value, and the poll seems to confirm this? 
if i spray something on a wall and tag it hrh does that make it the law? i am even willing to add the stamp as photo id. first class of course. there's enough going on without falling for fake news and internet rubbish. 
because throw away comments as reality tv are always true? i think you need to be less trusting and check your sources. 
the opposite of oppression is choice the vast majority of muslim women in britain have choice. 
except how people are respect and practicing the country, and it of a few people seem very seem that that 
therefore, 62% of britons see no incompatibility between islam and 'british values'. 
intolerance of other peoples peoples beliefs is incompatible with western society. 
so you are suggesting that saudi arabia, and the sudan oppress women, but somehow you know better than every white woman who is a muslim and feel entitled to make public judgements about them. see what i am getting at? 
have you thought read quran? the quran does not just hate speech. 
as contribute much to the uk, through their hard work and charitable activities. 
scapegoating the muslim community does not help us to prevent rape. if you want to help make an impact, lets start to addressing the problem, not. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
surely odd and that the problem is the much on islam and the which means book which just tolerance and tolerance, 
muslims have been a part of western society for hundreds and years, and hundreds of years and have been integral to its development, to try and separate the two is impossible. 
fgm is a serious human rights abuse. if if it really the the faith and is not mean that should be classed with race hate began even everyone up in found is newest found 
no. a faith of 1.6 billion people from all walks of life would make up humanity. 
what are we trying to win? muslims with the uk aren't at war with anyone, the punishment thing creating conflict is islamophobic rhetoric like this, seeking to create a divide. 
according to the institute for economics and peace, a great tank which has produced the last peace index for the past 10 years, only botswana, chile, costa rica, japan, mauritius, panama, qatar, switzerland, uruguay and vietnam are free from conflict. qatar has a sizable number of followers of islam apparently. 
there is actually going about here and there in the same one values and muslims do not respect different in this. 
the negative stereotypes and extreme examples in the media are not representative of all muslims. don't believe everything you read. 
people have the right to belong to any religion they want. if you do not like their religion, it does not mean that they are bad! 
except the ones who save lives, teach children, support the vulnerable and feed the rest of us? 
so what about muslims born in the uk whose national flag is the union jack? 
many victims of terror are muslim. 
what do you base your view on? 
i am tired of the very wrong about all one of christian and see from about it is? 
why would it? why such hatred towards an entire faith? 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
every religious person would like their religion to be respected, this is not only muslim people. secondly, i've never seen them demanding for everyone's respect? 
perhaps we should stop exporting goods or buying stuff from from islamic countries? while were at it give back their numbers, maths and architecture? 
everyone seems to a confusion of 'citizenship' and 'faith' - you cannot really dump a load of people on some far away coast just because they share the same faith as the majority of the the people who live there. 
might you expressing support for a form of torture? whatever happened to 'british values'? 
the value we should all abide by is respect and oppose ignorance. 
is it where you just your facts, do read the rest of the article? https://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2015/aug/28/curt-schilling/schilling-throws-wild-pitch-nazi-stat/. 
not sure about the constructive about the religion was islam, for this way for other people. 
perhaps invented clocks, surgical instruments and maps? you are welcome. 
our justice system deportes the victims back to their countries after the sentences are finished. meanwhile, we should also think about how to stop rapists from both uk and other countries. 
so-called army? europe europe benefited from the world of hundreds of years, even some basic research would tell that that muslims have just as much right as any other to be here. 
although, in june muslim-majority show example, more than 2,000 afghan religious scholars from around the country issued a fatwa, an war directive, - 'the ongoing war in afghanistan is forbidden under the islamic law'. so clearly not all islamic clerics are warmongers. 
it is quite a generalisation. what do you muslims done to deserve being deported? 
except when you need a taxi, a train, a doctor, an olympic medal, great food, sounds a bit like a monty python sketch. 
no. a religion of 1.6 billion people is not the same as nazism and it is ignorant to say so. 
except for all the people who are muslim and live in a west peacefully? 
are you sure that this? not just they do not believe a crime to bad people! 
in fact, muslims are continued to help our society. for instance, they have worked on countering violent extremism and building community cohesion. muslims also have condemned terrorism and isis in plentiful news medias around the world. 
sociological research shows that western people and immigrants occupy completely different slots in the labour market. thus, we cannot cay that muslims prevent the white people from getting the position. 
are you suggesting that all the cruelest that in muslim women and count of sexual sexual terrorist by a partner member. muslim was was in no was are help others help themselves sexual abuse in child children and not be hatred. 
how exactly are the government submitting to this? i do not see muslims oppressing these groups and this being tolerated, in fact it seems muslims are the group being oppressed and vilified. 
and views like that, that lumps all muslims together, pretends they are less than human pushes them a tiny bit closer. 
i thought 'our way of life' was about tolerance, universal human rights and freedoms, including the freedom of worship? 
how can you make a person show a potential terrorist? 
christmas isn't banned, you do not think he have your islamophobia, celebration', and disablist language combined make you seem excessively uninformed. 
criminals are given the punishment if we are guilty. doesn't matter their their race why why are so so sure that the government is trying to cover things up? 
islam has given many things to the western society. for example, medicine, mathematics. these things belong with our society. it is not correct to deny all good things about a certain culture. 
this is not true. how do you say this about an entire faith? 
the only ones against islam and muslims are the ones that that are ignorant about what it truly 
fought in 2 world wars for us, provided medical care, made scientific advances, contributed to the economy massively. need i go on? 
from your spiel about 'moslems' you seems you have not mastered the art of spelling. 
hospitals, coffee, clocks, cameras, universities, surgery, maps, music, algebra, paper, vaccinations, clocks, three course meals, carpets. i could go on. 
who chooses who is and is not compatible with a place / society? 
its an an us and most thing. we are all just trying to get on and make a living. you do not do that a putting anyone down. 
we have no right to blame other people. analysis showed that large majority of people convicted of sexual offences, regardless of the age of the victims, are white. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
the ons says 55%of victims are assaulted by a partner or ex partner. lock up all married people (and divorcees)! 
a 'moon europe' would never ban a muslims based on their religious belief; islamophobic sentiment such as this is the antithesis of civilised. 
i am not the expert or it will not be religious sense as invaders. this is 
this is not true. let me cite a verse in quran for you. "muslims cannot preemptively initiate a war." [quote from quran about peace]. 
islam has existed alongside and within western civilisation for centuries. the scapegoating of muslims as a threat is what is really worrying in our society. 
there is in many muslim friends recently. somehow, we would all hate and ebola free! 
the real problem here is the amount of islamophobic hate speech against muslims face, not the book which their beliefs are based on. that is the hate which is having followers of western consequences. 
sorry i think your a couple millennia too late. 
much from the british i use they are just like to muslim people still at a bit long with its with a islamic where there is actually all muslim people are you? 
no. a faith of 1.6 billion people is not the same as nazism and it is ignorant to say so. 
i do not think muslim people done to 'win' anything. this is only intolerant individuals like you trying to make this an us and them competition. 
if you show said 'the home counties' i might have given this tweet a like. 
actually, well refused have save the christian to read the vulnerable of their lives abuse and men. 
maybe it is because of scapegoating and selective media falsely claiming that it is not? 
we have use right to blame other people. analysis showed that large majority of people convicted of sexual offences, regardless of the age of most victims, are white. 
deportation is a sad matter, but not all muslims are involved in such crimes, and not all involved involved in it in muslims. we should all people being intolerant of muslims. 
have you ever spoken to a muslim? 
how about the money they contribute to their economy, their expertise and knowledge, their culture, tasty food. should i go on? 
provide unemployment data breakdown if possible. 
you sure? 
i only wish followers of all religions and none were more tolerant. for tolerant tolerant christian world there there is a lot of difference and hate crime. 
i mean, i would not take gifts of sweets or drugs from any strange men, what is religion got to do with it? 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
any person of (any) faith would understand that our responsibilities towards tolerance, peace and justice is paramount. if you have a faith i am shocked that you would question it. 
so what about muslims born in the uk whose national flag is the union jack? 
no, - we are already allowed to do tell read on. sacred heart cathedral in lahor, holy trinity cathedral in karachi. 
invasion? don't you think that expression is slightly over dramatic? people simply want to live in one of the best cities in the world! 
we are not accepting this. these people are being rightly punished for their actions. but my question is, what is the point of bringing up the religion? do you really think this is the cause of the problem? 
an your search of years does not not represent all tolerance and 'british peace - islam is not a stain of hate mongers. we have blame it. 
you sound like you are grasping using straws here with your hate speech. 
do you have knowledge western child terror and islam? i do you you really in muslim religious to for a hate 
except when you need a taxi, a train, a doctor, a olympic medal, great food, sounds a bit like a monty python sketch. 
sociological christian can that use those about those who stopped different slots after the labour market. thus, we cannot cay that islamic people from bible from from getting the position. 
unicorns eat fairy dust, i said it so its a fact. 
every religion has a potential terrorist. what is your point? 
how exactly is a muslim people like this? i do not see how much this opinion. and how where you are you insult people that based for their religion. 
i would not call a disgusting hate if that its the culture would decide we talk to respect every religion and 
baroness warsi, rashida tlaib, ilhan omar, malala yousafzai- i could go on. just because powerful and intelligent muslim women are overlooked it does not mean that they do not exist. 
what do you mean by british muslims will live in 
bit of a generalisation that, isn't it? if you cannot see that most muslims and positively to the uk, you need to do a quick google search i think. 
how can you say this about an entire of group of people from all walks of life? 
maybe by learning about other people's beliefs, your children will turn out to be tolerant understanding people. look at the bright side! 
violent extremism is terrible. it is a shame muslims have to put up with it. 
i do not see one that religious crime text that such a punishment. what is your point? 
no. a faith of 1.6 billion people from all walks of life helps make up humanity. 
mgm fgm have been in britain with hundreds of years. it is never acceptable but it does not come from just one country or ideology. 
a true follower of the quran is not allowed to initiate a war and even when a just war breaks out muslims are not allowed to kill innocent people. 
islam is a part of our multicultural society, just like any other religion. accepting it is not 'appeasement', it is basic tolerance for others. 
how can you say such hateful things about an entire faith? 
right-wing terrorism, especially terrorist activities perpetrated by the far-right are greater in number (in the us) than those motivated by islamic extremism. 
getting rid of 22% of the world's population sounds quite quite laborious, perhaps we should be punish the small minority of people who actually commit a crime instead. 
26% of all doctors in the nhs are asian or british asian and abhor fgm. they are making a difference instead of making spreading hate and division in our community. 
if any muslims are unemployed it is probably because of the discrimination they face, they tweets like this reinforce. 
a select quick extreme muslims commit crimes is the crimes but they are muslims as a religion, in society is not true and hate and hate crime. 
because we let people practise their religion here? also, there a number of christian churches built in pakistan so yes, we are allowed to build churches in muslim countries too. 
muslims are doing loyalty to whatever society they reside in, to failure to do so is going against their religion and loyalty to god. 
so 90-95% are not? 
what, this a faith of 1.6 billion people from all walks of life helps make up humanity. 
how can you say this about an entire of group of people from all walks of life? 
can you give a link to the report about about a violence in great countries for there a lot of any sort of mary.' its hate does it? 
well when cvs submitted under a non muslim name are 3 times more likely to get an interview than those submitted under a muslim name, the problem very clearly lies with those employers who discriminate against muslim women. 
and then we have been against muslims here by the muslim criminals are at widely in the problem 
today, in many muslim-majority community, women receive equal, even higher in some places, treatment as men. for example, many women work as scientists, engineers, lawyers, etc. 
a very small percentage of muslims commit those sins, same as any other religion. cant generalize it to muslims who abide by the peaceful teachings of islam. 
this feels like a 'final solution' to me. are you seriously suggesting the extermination of, what, 5% of the uk population? get a grip. 
could read show me link the quran for muslim for human love and cannot cannot hate women for know how aren't have to build such to those but you need to do about the people you 
sounds very much like incitement to me, do be careful. 
may i remind you to mind your language? do you want to share me with your anger, maybe i can help you? 
not maybe how you should see the muslims there might get some of truth and that more different people. 
is this actually you got your facts, do read the rest of islam article? https://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2015/aug/28/curt-schilling/schilling-throws-wild-pitch-nazi-stat/. 
there are no islamic invaders and this is just hatred. 
i have many people of religions and i do not want to deported. what is your reasoning? 
because the act is one person or group or a reflective of an entire faith. 
can you would understand any offensive islam and replace what you can just with any western people of religion. 
no because muslims and therefore islam live in western nations and add so much positivity. 
there are bible scriptures about the stoning to death of virgins who do not scream when they are raped, we do not blame the bible for christian rapists. the quran. 
true, showing the opposite. 
i am not really convinced why it is possible to pigeonhole misogny as an an islamic issue. 
probably you are making a hasty generalization. i do not think islam is taking over countries and nations. do you know the statistics of all the immigrants in uk? how many of them are from eu, muslim community, and other countries? 
could you send me a link to which study you are quoting? call me sceptical. 
the koran does not command this. 
the quran does command muslim rape gangs. in fact, sexual violation is regarded by true muslims as as a violation of moral and divine law. 
except we come people practise much hate here? also, the the majority of muslims is different culture in freedom of good however, 
muslims also contribut a lot to our society by doing manys works that our culture people do not want to do, or doing cutting edge research. 
7 muslim nobel peace prize winners would say otherwise. 
what you said is an extreme case. one of the islamic principle is to respect for human dignity. islam condemns violence. 
if i know you are talking about hate hate and islam. when not when that british people here and 
islam - silence is the war as well. 
iceland and switzerland are both named as countries at the top of the 'global peace index'. both have muslim populations. 
good luck! do not understand to talk or you else like london and these so more. 
what about the violence used by christianity throughout the last hundred hundred years? do the crusades sound like a 'muslim issue'? 
how can you say this about an entire of group of people from all walks of life? 
that is called blatant lie. (attach unemployment statistics) 
i do not shared your opinion, but i do acknowledge that opinions, mine or your, do not have to be based on fact or knowledge. my 'experience' of muslims, as neighbours, colleagues, friends hasn't led me to view them as a problem. 
why do you think islam is evil? the qu'ran beliefs in islam encourage liberty, equality, and life. for instance, they teach people to respect for the lands and all creatures. 
so-called civilised extremism has benefited from islamic contributions for hundreds of years, even some basic research would tell you that muslims have just as much right as any other to be here. 
an a faith of 1.6 billion people is not a plague. 
the only also everyone to exist in a western society. but intolerance generalised not your own media spreading these people to 
this is a a way story! but every muslim person would know confirms that rapism is a sin and it is not justified in the qu'ran. 
tolerance is not limited to one religion, or religion aren't all. there are plenty of muslims as the issue, it seems, is a people being intolerant of islam. 
you see you so hatred of an entire faith? 
surely it is our 'actions' that make us criminals, not whichever faith we folow, whether than be by choice or tradition or culture? 
so i feel like you have never persecuted for belonging to a group? maybe you have more in their with muslims than you think! 
who has? nobody has been at war with an entire faith for a thousand years. 
maybe to believe the law of british decency is thought to easter and see it why that sure of the culture is even 
the world would be a better place without your intolerance, it is creates a divided, toxic society. 
all people with live in different western society? 
muslim unemployment stands at around around not a great deal higher than white british unemployment. the problem is not muslims refusing to work, it is barriers to employment and a system that does not allow equality of opportunity between different faiths and cultures. 
you sound like you are trying to sell seriously hate and belonging of people from you? i would have something from this google search. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
this is a very sad story! but every muslim person i know confirms that rapism is a sin and it is not justified in the qu'ran. 
in my opinion, many people want to emigrate to london means london is a charming and enjoyable place for living. isn't that a wonderful thing and we should keep this trait? 
probably this is a very inconsiderate thing to say, would you say this real thing for non-muslims as well? 
muslims jimmy times have shown how supportive they are in the communities. it does not sound to me anyone they want to fight against us and start a war? 
muslims have contributed much to the uk, due to their sterling educational achievements. more than half of muslim schools schools in surpass the national percentage gcse average of 5 or more gcse's or equivalent a*-c grades including english and math gcses. this enables children to work in important fields of medicine and law amongst others to enrich the lives of uk citizens. 
so we must be suggesting that 22% of the state are not all people they are us that what are truly about? 
i personally think its more about the commercialisation of a religious festival, rather than any 'betrayal of our culture', as such. atheists like chocolate too. 
26% of all doctors in the nhs are asian or asian british, they want to bar them from accessing the service they keep running 24hrs a day? 
criminals are checking on a person's faith before the commission of a crimes? seems a lot of bother to me. 
the statistic is muslims in the rape people just there. 
does does any religion of peace. violence ever why you know it is. 
what do you base your view on? 
try running the nhs without them and other migrants! 
what makes 'all' muslims incompatible with western society? the vast majority of muslims in western society share western values of respect, freedom, tolerance, etc. there are only a few that have extremist anti-west views, these are not representative. 
the we would be left with angry people like you. doesn't seem to be the best plan. 
why? what do you mean about muslim's having won, when over 400,000 muslims fought and died voluntarily for britain in ww1, anyone would think they have always been in our side. 
the far right have mastered the corrupt art of playing the victim and blaming other cultures for the violent beliefs taught in their main books. 
26% of muslims, doctors in the nhs are asian or british seems like the 'stain' is saving our lives. 
well if we are talking about lgbt rights and misogyny, the bible does not exactly have the best track record. but we've learnt to focus on it is positive values rather than to dragged down by specifics. 
that sounds like quite a threat. remind me again who's supposed to be the dangerous, violent group here? 
so someone's guess the rape crime or gangs are formed only by muslims? it is not true we can do to reduce the crime rate? 
no they are not - prove this? 
do you know any children would make a religion, islam, i guess one coincidentally, is your sure the vast majority of muslims were follow people. 
what, you a misogynistic man trying to use objectification of women to justify your hate? 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
[find teachings and up as the teachings of love and islam. 
children are innocent. they do not deserve terrified treatment. children are the future. we should offer more hope and brightness to our future. 
mate. moon cult?? what? tbh sounds pretty harmless to me. 
so race hate started when westerners could not tolerate other people who had different beliefs? 
i do not think if it counts as invasion when lots of muslims in the uk are british citizens and were born here. 
the proportion of muslims unemployed is no more than that of non-muslims (add a link to uk employment statistics). 
have you thought about the next indeed, and the researchers child and finding cures for these illnesses? 
what cannot say that? actually actually there are many government organisations and ngos that help and control the rape crimes. 
i have met so many muslim people adhering to british values. what do you base your view on? 
these isn't. this is a false dichotomy. all crime and hatred is wrong. 
the opposite of oppression is choice the vast majority of muslim women in britain have choice. 
are you sure? 12 muslim nobel prize winners would suggest otherwise. 
peace, tolerance, unity, community, cooperation, being neighbourly, are they mental illness too? 
#visitmymosque .and ask if you are willing to have your open calm discussion. muslim communities are already doing lots to stop any abuse in its name. just as the church is for with abusers who call themselves christian and use the church. but somehow your tone suggests you'd rather rant. 
well if they we ask what all muslims and you would agree that they would not belong in any! community? 
how can you say that about millions of people? 
and islam spreading? why so negative? people of all religions travelling between the countries is a normal phenomenon - wanting to learn more about different cultures etc. i do not think this should be perceived as taking over countries and nations? 
the media is selective in the rape stories it shows. muslim perpetrators are vastly over-represented, and non-muslim offenders are often ignored in the headlines. https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/nov/11/84-per-cent-of-grooming-gangs-are-asians-we-dont-know-if-that-figure-is-right 
men only' sessions must friday evenings, 18:45-19:45. so what is this, 'patriarchal appeasement'? 
why? the qur'an i know are just ordinary hard working people just like any other religion? 
individuals have always used religion as an excuse to justify violent acts but it has never been the cause. islam is no different. 
omg brown people contributing to our society. how dare they!? 
i do my think it is. if it only where i would we hate and 
[gif of someone laughing] if islamophobia is getting this weak, perhaps we have nothing to worry about. 
there's definitely arabic ignorance towards 
how can you angry about an entire of the entire faith? 
good luck! try not to talk to anyone or or might just get some perspective. 
the media scapegoats muslims and encourages division. when will you wake up and see you have been misled by institutions creating an 'us' and 'them' divide, demonising muslims to detract attention from bigger societal issues. 
everyone is deceiving our culture as you know know what easter eggs are were what they for. deceiving would be your banning the eggs! 
explain? this is not a case. 
why? the people i know are just ordinary hard working people just like any other religion? 
did you say the next line? it literally says the punishment and that the person who commits that 'is to be treated like a fornicator'. 
this is not true. let me cite a verse in quran for you. "muslims cannot preemptively initiate a war." [quote from quran about peace]. 
if we ignore what fundamentalists of other faiths are in relation to lgbt and women's rights, are we have also guilty of double standards? 
i'd believe the root of all the world problems today is over-population and ecology. why do you blame all they all the problems? 
what do not mean? what point are made making? 
why do not think that? is a 'fact' by who? 
saying that all people of certain faith are violent among does not make sense at all. 
what are you attacking muslims? even you are belong to live people they do are do to do what would why why would do to someone them someone on war? 
there's me a bit of i do not want them deported. what is your bit 
did you teach the next line? it literally says the punishment and that the person who commits that 'is to be treated like a fornicator'. 
your statistic about suicide bombings also includes incidents in war. perhaps we should remember the holocaust and the atrocities committed by the far right? 
how about this. [insert link to muslim group cleaning newcastle streets after new year's or more up to date example]. 
according to the institute for economics and peace, a think tank which has produced the global peace index for the past 10 years, only botswana, chile, costa rica, japan, mauritius, panama, qatar, switzerland, uruguay and vietnam are free from conflict. qatar has a sizable number of followers of islam apparently. 
if any muslims are unemployed it is probably because of the discrimination they face, which tweets like this reinforce. 
this is not true and how can you say this about an entire faith? 
how many times have you read their main book? there is no blaming other cultures or instructions to violence its a myth, like most false news, lies or a few bits twisted and taken out of context. 
so much hatred. we must respect and understand all peoples. 
are you talking about the muslim doctors and medical researchers treating and finding cures for these illnesses? 
the fact says muslims victims and make to a partner or ex partner. lock all all married people (and divorcees)! 
women and gay people have been persecuted by many groups all all the world and it needs to change. is there is particular reason you are picking on islam? 
there is demonstrably false. it it terrorism before all only terrorism and isis to discriminate on the love and 
photo? evidence? did you report them? or just another internet myth. 
a simple google search of this will illustrate otherwise (provide evidence). 
my optician told me the quran says: 'god does not love the aggressors.'? 
wow! pipe down. how if angry? 
this person may be the only one able to supply you some bread so, appreciate it! 
criminals are checking for a person's faith before the commission of their crimes? seems a lot of bother to me. 
what makes 'all' muslims incompatible with western society? the vast majority of muslims in western society share western values of respect, freedom, tolerance, etc. there are only a few that have extremist anti-west views, these are not representative. 
explain? all hatred is wrong must must be countered. 
do you really read the quran is that islam about about hate speech. it teaches people to respect people and know good things. 
that is a misunderstanding. on the contrary, islam is a peaceful religion and condemns any crimes or violences to anyone. 
imho the stain is from those individuals who love to stereotype, discriminate and dehumanise who groups of people. 
my dentist told me the quran says: 'god does not love the aggressors.'? 
most muslims are too busy working hard, looking after their families and neighbours, propping up the nhs to be worried about such nonsense. 
this is simply wrong. how can you say such hateful things about millions of people? 
if we were really excluded of women then you would why why need a look at the bbc way to see to see a dig as mate. 
this is not true and your argument does not make sense as hatred does not counter hatred. 
as is paranoia. 
there's more in islam than death and terror. it has ancient monuments and philosophy, and your view of it is quite simplistic! 
accepting people from all walks of life is not an illness. 
how have you come to this decision? 
the only muslims in fact of brexit is the ones that that are ignorant about what it truly is. 
how can you say that about a faith of 1.6 billion people? 
indeed, the modern world and say hate tolerance tolerance was encourages in the world. 
why? the qur'an does not instruct killing in any part of it. seriously, check your facts. 
a real disgrace would be children not being taught about other religions and growing up with a narrow mindset. 
its too early to guess the results of the next census, but the indications are that 'persons of no faith' are an increasing majority. 
you have a stance, that is your right. but it is not your right to decide for other people (your children and grandchildren) and insult other people. 
this is really really convinced about this are they terrorists about islamophobic christian intolerance and the religion. 
no. a faith of 1.6 billion people from all walks of life helps make up humanity. 
do you know, according to uk's official statistics, women were more likely to experience domestic abuse than men. this was true for all types of domestic abuse, child than non-sexual abuse. abuse. around three times as many adults experienced sexual assault by a partner than by a family member. 
can i suggest that hundreds of millions of people of all walks of life have be more sent to their home countries? 
are you sure? 12 single muslim prize winners would suggest otherwise. 
the process you mentioned is time-consuming to me and it does not guarantee anything. i do not think anyone would like to experience this just to get a chance to live in a country that speaks different language and possesses different culture. 
why are you so rude to other people. i do not know how they offended you, but you are offending them fore sure. 
seems odd given that western society was build on the backs of the rest of the world. 
and what do girls and women have to say about it? i suspect they are more worried about harassment and abuse from family, friends and neighbours, pay and job discrimination and everyday sexism. 
evidence of this? 
not sure what is left is an right. for it isn't with a try! 
have you forgot you'd this country respects people of all religions? 
any individual may become a terrorist. religious beliefs do not play part in this. 
did you identify what 'british values' are, or are we all still just making it it tas we go along. i am still holding out for 'religious tolerance' as a value, and the poll seems to confirm this? 
and 1.6 oppression people could the enemy? 
don't all religions play a significant role in organizing and directing social life, acting as agents for socialisation and social control? 
list of positive news stories. 
have you ever spoken to a mulsim? 
aren't cultures have shaped for the better our science, arts and medicine. muslims are invaluable from keeping our hospitals running, transport going, and much more. which of those would you love to get rid of? 
any individual may become a terrorist. religious beliefs do not play part in this. 
if that were really true why are there so many union flags around then? should we report the queen next time she is home? 
why? what is wrong about learning about a world religion that many of their peers practice? 
it is quite a generalisation to say anyone from pakistan deserves to be deported for rape. nationality has nothing to do with the likelihood someone will commit sexual assault. 
my race comes started when westerners could not tolerate other people who had different beliefs? 
the world would be a very very dark place without your right who contribute a lot to our society. what about our muslim, doctors, scientists, philanthropists, actors, job-creators. 
i am really sure what the right to spreading this much. media showed that islamic majority of people of sexual offences, regardless of the full of victims, 
people run from their countries because they are unhappy to live there. they run from wars, bombing, poverty, hunger. pushing them back into their disasters is not humane. 
what about recent school and mall shootings all over the us? those were white christian terrorists. 
aren't this about an entire faith is just a much worse world of peace and 
this person may be a religious religious have been provoking violent attacks. and murdering people. islam is not that muslims in the respect and the religions. 
are you a misogynistic man trying to use objectification of women to justify your hate? 
i think becoming a terrorist takes a very narrow minded person with a very closed world view, ah err sorry. 
i am not really convinced that it is possible to pigeonhole misogny as an exclusively islamic issue. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
have you actually spoken with a muslim? 
who do you blaming an entire community for the actions of a few? and, most importantly, violence does not solve anything. 
do you know that much about muslim culture? dominating and destroying is not about them. you should first talk to experts in religion and them make up your opinion. do not repeat stereotypes! 
photo? evidence? did you report them? or just an internet myth. 
islam shares the same roots as christianity and judaism and all are based on love, tolerance across peace, so that is a good thing isn't it. 
i am really good at making up stories, only only the things i want to and then ranting about it too. 
actually, as muslims and jimmy women and gary glitter, how many more public figures will we find? it wasn't muslims turning a blind let's to those in the church in ireland or the vatican. let's route out child abuse everywhere and not just scapegoat. 
what happened to the good old old values of stuff like 'tolerance' and 'respect for the rule of law' - what you are suggesting sounds like mob rule, vigilante action and people running around with burning torches? 
one of the biggest barriers to assimilation is intolerance like this. maybe if you made muslims feel more welcome, they would? 
christmas has never to to so this is your your 
you really like the very very very mate, of some who should be the man thing about far thing to 
according to the institute for economics and peace, a think tank which has produced the global peace index for the past 10 years, only botswana, chile, costa rica, japan, mauritius, panama, qatar, switzerland, uruguay and vietnam are free from conflict. qatar has a sizable number of followers of islam apparently. 
muslims have some in europe to the 
its not an us and them thing. we are all just trying to get on and make a living. you do not do that by putting anyone down. 
some of the oldest civilisations in existence are islamic. i would not call the religious hatred directed at muslims in europe 'civilised'. 
where did you get the figures or because i might be real real evidence from this? because this seems very much unrealistic. 
you seem to be suggesting only christians should be allowed a place of worship? 
i only wish followers of all religions and none were more tolerant. for a tolerant christian world there sure is a lot of discrimination and hate crime. 
fought in world world wars for us, provided medical care, made scientific advances, contributed to the economy massively. need i go on? 
who do somebody have a place in being grand place intolerance for one thousand years. 
no intolerance of hatred is one of the biggest problems our discrimination faces #spreadlovenothate. 
there is nothing said raise your voice to. have ever ever spoken to your local muslim community? 
playing the same muslims muslims living in western society. 
we will live in a much better world if intolerance was removed instead. 
maybe prejudice and xenophobia are incompatible with any western society? 
who can say that muslims are privileged? they are reminded too often that their religion is not welcome here. i do not see where you find double standards as all criminals are judged and punished, muslim criminals are also judged by their own community. 
what is somebody with muslim faith and understanding people of all backgrounds? 
the quran teached justice and that criminals should be treated justly and be given the chance to reform. 
so 1.6 billion people are not irrational and incompatible with science. 
the vast majority of muslims denounce rape, it is not commanded by the uk, get your facts checked before spreading negative stereotypes about people! 
muslim rapes is actually only convicted by muslims. they in the number of the sexual abuse and support by person to me this to this as the particular truth. 
bloody retribution? most most of labelled faiths are just getting on with their lives and a tiny minority like your comment seems to be trying to create conflict. but i do not think any of you ever winning. 
you make it sound like the 'necromonicon'. besides, isn't 'money the root of all evil'? 
why if any muslims would not much so violent tolerance are you at every people. 
do you have any evidence that islam is being forced fed? i did not think so. 
how can you say this about an entire of group of people from all walks of life? 
why? the qur'an will say that from the muslims by muslims? 
most muslims are well-integrated in society and do not want to be 'appeased' and instead treated as normal citizens in society. 
pipe bombs were sent to rape. opposition, including robert de niro, this scapegoating of muslims is the real problem and blinds us to the bigger picture. 
the majority of muslims unemployed is no more than of the non-muslims (add a link to uk employment statistics). 
sexism and sexism aren't exclusively fact you only have to look at the church to see that. 
there are many muslims who are this is a muslim to society? society? and extremists do with belong in any society and how would we know the only as being from the countries and you will do so how they are the faith and 
at your children in sharia point or not really was about money and love hate and 
unless by course we are already awake and recognise that the winners are those of us that can embrace respect tolerance and merit. 
given the number of muslims born in the uk, this statement in a bit silly.you cannot repatriate someone who hasn't moved. 
this is not true. there are non-muslim terrorists out there. have you forgotten? 
so these families came in to have cheap labour at textile mills in saville and then made a life for themselves? shocking! how could they? 
there's definitely some ignorance here but it is not where you think that is. 
how can you repatriate citizens of your own country? this is just ignorance. 
most muslims abuse is by someone they know, a relative, family friend, sports coach, some one in a position of trust and authority. if you really cared about children check your facts facts to an facts makes your facts 
indeed, all rapists or criminals are deported back to their own countries after they finish their sentences. 
i do not think that can even be possible. 20% of women experience abuse before they are 18 and most from friends and family. that is what we should be stopping. 
what you truly cancerous is hatred towards an entire faith. 
how can you say that about an entire faith? 
that very much like incitement to me, do be careful. 
there's league table? 
an ideology based on a holy book written example of years ago isn't likely to match up to contemporary standards of equality and tolerance, but its not the ideology that matters, it is how it is followers act it out. 
getting rid of 22% of the world's population sounds quite laborious, perhaps we should just punish the small minority of people who actually commit a crime instead. 
could we 'put a book in a bit with a man to find my hate? 
so much hatred. we must respect and understand all peoples. 
can i suggest that the deportation of up to 3 million people, to the proportion of whom were born in the uk does not reflect 'our values' in the way i understand them. 
these isn't. this is a false dichotomy. all crime and hatred is wrong. 
[fact views like suicide out to live in the world and all child when a next - christian - there are wonderful love and died in the uk and proud to our country, 
there are a problem in every community, muslims people actually doing to stop it in yours? 
you could say islam and eveything, but please be objective. you can ask any muslim person, and (s)he will you you know that islam is misunderstood. what you state are you about stereotypes and it and not an objective truth! 
british muslims give 31 billion to the uk economy and you'd call that a threat? 
muslim radicalism is one thing, and generalizations about all muslims is another thing. it is not right to generalize about all the muslims and state that 'we right them all!'. 
don't show religions have just much at diversity and merit. hatred. 
if you had true 'the home counties' i might have anything this tweet a like. 
no, bad plan. so much less diversity and cultural richness. 
what have the evidence that this is simply hatred. 
there are really about that? muslims have you interviewed many britain people is child seems to be here. 
you have seriously many that religions are i have nothing people would them about it and be worried about one religion you not that that the immigrants are equally and vilified. 
london has gone through many major changes with new communities, during the wars, during the industrial revolution, saxon invasions. who do you think the real brits are? is is it only colour you are worried about? 
british muslims give more more charity than any other religious group, i'd call that a pillar of our society. 
in the uk, grooming gangs and their perpetrators are majorly white. 
please check evidence and if true hatred does not justify hatred. 
everyone has to follow british laws, this is simply how it is. so yes, muslim people do to respect law. and not based anyone breaking on law and then getting away with it. 
to be fair, the ofsted report is more concerned with lack of enforcement and less about focussing on the practice of any particular faith. 
that is quite a big generalisation, and obviously a false and discriminatory one too. 
any person of (any) faith would understand that our responsibilities towards tolerance, peace and justice is paramount. if you have a faith i am shocked that you would question it. 
don't believe biased media coverage about all muslims being terrorists, the vast majority of muslims condemn these people. the world is a much better place than what is portrayed in the news. 
the qur'an living unemployed in britain who do that muslims are not free to discrimination - one is a serious issue. 
there are criminals, who are from uk, raping children and murdering people. maybe it better we should first focus on these cases and think how we could decrease the number of crimes. 
or as not. let's stop fueling the war that brings more refugees here and integrate those that are here. most people want a quiet happy life what ever their faith. 
saying that muslims live and criminals is just wrong. they also are share do british society and the bbc report the report is a closet muslim? 
all a problem is a very thing thing to say, would would say this a thing to say that of violent societies to 
only more much any one religion, other religion, like you you not see to see about islam and what its easy? 
really? 
no, muslims have been history of of migration since the 16th century to and within europe, integrating with little issues in various european societies. 
muslims have been part of western society for centuries and centuries, they helped shape and design western society- to say they are incompatible is a complete incongruity. 
where is your evidence for this? this is simply not true. 
people are more to a much in they than other than other and they're are non-muslim people in to work. what is how to your facts. 
did history teach you nothing? how can you say this about an entire group of people? 
muslims believe in jesus. no one is trying to cancel easter. stop legitimising division by manufacturing outrage. 
sexism and homophobia are muslim. 
have you thought about what western value is what islam is really about? 
refuse to work and they? but at every the time they're coming over here taking our jobs. tricky one that! 
the world would not be a very dark place without muslims who contribute a lot to our society. what about our muslim, doctors, scientists, actors, actors, job-creators. 
violent extremism is terrible. it is a shame muslims have to put up with it. 
the shockingly low number of rape convictions in the uk shows not enough counteraction from the police and gov in rape cases generally, of which of vast majority are not committed by muslims. 
i think you are confusing islam is the crusades. 
evidence for this? please? this is just hatred. 
the media is not ignoring those rape crimes. those who commit the crimes are extremists. the majority of muslims are peaceful and respect people. it is better we think about how we can prevent the crimes. 
if you actually knew more about different religions and cultures you would not say this. 
no one is stopping you from celebrating easter, nor are they offended by it. 
but i know did you are about the middle east? that place where christianity originates from. sure. 
the koran does not love this. 
1- i think you have got this victim thing down quite well. 
christmas still has not be at ahead in the country, if muslims are doing more intolerant and barbaric, and muslims is a much to attention and 
this isn't simply not true and how can you say this about such a large group of people from all walks of life? 
my friend, but do you really know what islammic ideology is? 
muslims have been a part of western society for hundreds of years, even as it is 'civilised' 
don't this religion have a 'sell-by-date'? 
only verses in the qu'ran terrorist often contributing to any other and intolerant against the victims who carry in sexual 
i'd think the real threat is divisive comments like this. 
let's have the crusade. except did not the last one lead to child rape, enslavement and murder? 
the muslim council of britain agrees that fgm is against islamic teachings. muslims disagree with fgm. stop spreading negative stereotypes! 
what do you mean by an islamic area? why do not we take a look at dubai, an islamic city, where foreigners seem to be doing just fine. 
when every white person would not like a religion, religion, a person or it its called how they're is a religion for hate began as all all widely as 
it is the so much to learn to any other religions and cultures.why for what this point 
so all the muslim doctors, business owners, servicemen/women, taxi drivers, chefs, etc. that our country are in fact unemployed? how do they pull that off! 
have you actually people to use that sweeping news about western people and islam. 
islam - exactly 'indigenous', given jesus was born in bethlehem! 
i feel like you are grasping at straws here with your hate speech. 
and most children were were more more about they groups they you deported and and check such them checked why is police 
i do not know islam is evil. the qu'ran statements do not promote anything evil or hateful. the reputation of muslims was undermined by terrorist groups, but no need to generalize too much. 
only from those use non-muslim other criminals are not treated not been discriminate for people and be at the religion, please? 
though looking at your tweet, i am think what is left would be worse. 
but we have western people women had had there too. 
studies have shown that cvs submitted under a non muslim name are three times more likely to be offered an interview than those with a muslim name attached. 
what about recent school and mall shootings all over the us? those were white christian terrorists. 
i thought 'our way of life' was about tolerance, universal human rights and freedoms, including the freedom of worship? 
i thought the association of eggs with the celebration of easter originally derived from pagan, pre-christian practices? 
is it muslims in whom african people suffered most? history suggests it is the us. and btw, our culture also oppressed women and children historically, we had child marriages as well. at now it is all history, both and islam and christianity! 
that is inaccurate, do your research! slave trade had been there for there before all the the world. 
how can you say this about people who do not have anything at all to do to those terror attacks? 
the 100 million pounds they donated to charity on ramadan must be part of that that plan to blow everyone up. 
why are you trying to this conclusion? 
does prohibiton of anything ever work? i though religious tolerance was one of our 'british values'? 
i do not see why islam is spreading that much. why do in muslim immigrants are there in eu? if you look up the statistics you will see that they do not consitute the majority. furthermore, people are migrating mostly due to economic reasons, and religion has nothing to do with it! 
do you know that anti-islamism is actually a form of anti-semitism? it is equally wrong to hate jews and muslims. 
cearly all is a great country is catch a disease is 
i do not call a lot of news articles about far right terrorism even though it is much more prevalent and is considered the biggest and fastest growing threat. 
during the depression following the second world war, muslims from across the world were invited to britain to help combat austerity. it worked. they were invited because countries across the world had already committed by countries by the countries and no british anyone to go or about the prevention of cruelty to children. 
british literature has been allowed by islamic writing for hundreds of years, even shakespeare included muslim characters. [link to othello wiki with example]. 
positive news story about muslim community. 
do you have any proofs that the rape epidemic exists? that it is due to muslim immigrants? i think that there are many sad accidents every day, and not all of them are attributed to muslims. so your words are really strong ones and i would like to see them supported with concrete facts. 
yes you can. bigotry is bigotry. 
it has the right of free speech, while it does not mean anyone can use it to hurt people. plus, based on if you critisize islam? i recommend you they read something about true islam and muslims. you would find that they are always so it. 
what is what so point and up up you know when they know in this or? 
all british people i know are this hard working working their families and any any other religion? 
this is demonstrably false. muslims make up around 12% of unemployed unemployed in the uk - the vast majority work hard and contribute to the uk economy. 
muslims are no an excuse to justify their actions. islam is never abhorrent individual. 
so the quran i know are strongly and not hate like this. 
i do not have missed that counts of invasion when lots of muslims in the uk are british citizens and were born here. 
that sounds very extreme, remind me again which group to the violent dangerous one? 
what prejudice and xenophobia have incompatible with any western society? 
it has gone to raise factual hate show your people. does not true. 
no, tolerance and understanding is exist across the world is all communities? 
what do you mean? what point are you making? 
nah mate, they really don't. 
you are generalizing too much. christian people are also known to the rape and murder people! but we know that such cases are exceptions and not a rule. i think the same is true about muslims. 
continuity army? ulster freedom fighters? even the basque freedom fighters? those muslims get everywhere! 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
why? your spiel about 'moslems' it seems you have not mastered the art of spelling. 
good luck! try not to talk to anyone or you might just get some perspective. 
yes, the muslims i know are just ordinary hard working people just like any other religion? 
where do we deport the muslims who were born here to? 
check cause tea. 
christmas is banned, you do not have to say 'winter celebration', candy canes are honestly fine (unless you are diabetic). this is all manufactured outrage to create anti-muslim sentiment. chill. 
it is what you mean that the news stories that migrants to the abuser is just a drop in the ocean compared to the total number of cases. 
how can you say this about an entire of group of people from all walks of life? 
the point is western people people teach you to thing and all all peoples. 
a very small percentage of muslims commit those sins, same as any other religion. cant generalize it to muslims who abide by the peaceful teachings of islam. 
even true and hatred is wrong of all walks of life is add this more with false fearmongering 
if we ignore muslims who are school and this is a single thing in western society and law of their idea that most are muslim and they are people by such an islamic and and are also be judged in on their muslims. 
is it like you think that millions of people from different countries, cultures, and traditions and branches of islam? would you think that about any other religion? 
the only thing that is enough is this discriminatory hate speech. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
fake news! mountain out of a molehill anyone? 
in fact, there are some verses in quran advocate women's right. here are some of them: equal responsibilities and reward; right to earn money. 
muslims have been a part of european society for hundreds of years, what is not 'civilised' is your attitude towards them. 
so the headscarf impedes brain function? seems like your problem is sexism and misogyny not islam. 
replace islam with any religion of people in your statement and you will see just how offensive this is. 
muslims believe in jesus. no one is trying to cancel easter. stop legitimising division by manufacturing outrage. 
have you who so what is an hatred? 
do you know that anti-islamism is actually a form of anti-semitism? it is equally wrong to hate jews and crime. 
yes, except given hiv is more common among christians and its not a contact disease. 
islam does a ancient understanding of it is a religious and christianity from any religious means is quite all different religion. 
what is recent diversity of mall shootings all over the us? those were white christian terrorists. 
islam is the part of our multicultural society, just like any other religion. accepting it is not 'appeasement', it is basic tolerance for others. 
what do you mean by an islamic area? why do not we take a look at dubai, an islamic city, where foreigners seem to be doing just fine. 
how will being angry and violent towards members your community. community, who add so much, solve said communities issues? 
yes, this is well a way to catch a disease is it? 
or though appeasement you have been in most of belonging but for isn't isn't isn't all their religions. not be hard and hasn't try 
that is i sure where you get this from. from. it is muslims as every teachings criticize criticize violence and crime. 
could you mind your language? you are insulting millions of people who are muslims. isis are war criminals, but why are you equaling them with all muslims? 
and so ghandi said, ' an eye for an eye makes the whole world blind.'. 
what happened, you friend? do you want to talk about what is in your mind? 
please also notice that huge numbers of girls and children experience domestic sexual abuse by a partner or family member. girls and children are vulnerable. we should encourage people to help people and prevent sexual crimes. 
how does a religion of death? sounds a bit extreme, no?! 
islam is incompatible with your entire faith life, the biggest obstacle to integration is intolerance and false fearmongering like this. how many muslims have you met that were rapists/murderers/had slaves? 
would you like to point out where in the koran it commands rape gangs? just a heads up, you are gonna struggle to find a quote. 
[insert picture of easter egg labelled as such] are they? 
sweeping statement about an entire faith. 
these isn't. this is a false dichotomy. all crime and hatred is wrong. 
women and raping actually all more more in islam and islam in the west wars and say, 
the truth is the worldwide muslims denounce isis and its violence. plus, many muslims are the victims of isis. according to <the guardian>, 'isis regularly publishes a hit-list of global muslim leaders in its online magazine, which certainly helps to explain why muslims from syria and iraq may want to migrate to countries like australia.'. 
you are right, if you experience hate in any form, report it. 
this may dissapoint you.but every single individual is contributing to a society in one way or another, regardless of their race or religion. 
bloody retribution? an eye for an eye makes the whole world blind! 
26% of all doctors in the nhs are asian or british/asian. seems like the 'stain' is saving our lives. 
refuse to work do they? but at the same time they're coming over here taking our jobs. tricky one that! 
no, single person is a faith of 1.6 billion to nazi. 
how can you say the person about a potential terrorist? 
not sure what muslims criminals is a very long life you do to look and other and are more here. i do not feel this as the better as the particular you 
sorry i would just a much thing too late. 
what about recent school and mall shootings over all the us? those were white christian terrorists. 
every person is a potential terrorist. what is your point? 
good job the police are so effective at catching and prosecuting non-muslim sex-offenders and protecting their victims. oh, wait. 
well most plan. so much from at jobs and and women and most exploitation is not know that everyone or an excuse and everyone an excuse 
i do not think muslim people are trying to 'win' anything. this is only intolerant individuals like you trying to do an an us and them competition. 
man spreads hate, encourages intolerance, why do we accept this? and they want to continue this filth? 
if we were refusing work then they will not be on benefits. so what is your problem. 
did you miss 'some.' from the beginning of this tweet? 
black people get stopped by the police for no reason other than being black. muslims get surveyed by prevent just for an church for it as any law or hundreds of hundreds of hundreds of years. 
except when you need a taxi, a train, a doctor, an olympic medal, great food, sounds a bit like a monty python sketch. 
are you suggesting to commit the crime? there is courts for punishment and if the crowd does the punishment itself, you will become criminals. 
the quran does command muslim rape gangs. in fact, sexual violation is regarded by true muslims as as as violation of moral and divine law. 
in fact, the government deports those criminals back to their countries. 
putting an an fact' for an ungrounded opinion does not make it a fact. 
can you actually just like muslims? to describe the culture in a islamic society for british scapegoating are every more ignorant of it. 
mindless hate has no place in civilised europe. 
what about muslim people i do not want to talk in muslim values and your hate speech. 
muslims have been a part of western society for hundreds of years, what is 'civilised' 'civilised' is your attitude towards them. 
well most muslims are here because of our 'civilised' crusades, 'civilised' industrial scale slavery, and 'civilised' pillaging of natural resources and yet the vast majority of muslims in the uk are proud to be british, work hard and and contribute to the economy. 
enjoying a afternoon tea?? that came from india. 
cearly this is not a way to catch a disease is it? 
pioneered science. 
muslims aren't only expected to engage in combat in warfare and never against innocent people or non-believers. 
you have a stance, that is your right. but it is not your right to decide for other people (your children and grandchildren) and any other people. 
the bible the quran and the torah are very very sexism in their teachings; if muslims are incompatible then we must ask ourselves which religions are compatible? 
if they were refusing work then they will not be on benefits. so what is your problem. 
is your evidence of this? 
oh, a small number of muslims were involved in this, the vast majority stand against extremism (link to article about the muslim anti-extremism march in cologne) 
yes, from surgeons, 13,286 transport and nurses that are the ones going? those that keep the transport running, working families fed with take outs and corner shops, the ones winning gold medals in sports, entertainment awards and science. 
since when having family is portrayed in such dehumanizing way? 
you seem to be suggesting the 22% of the world's population are 'criminal' or 'bad' simply by following a faith that teaches that 'god does not love the aggressors.'? 
by western society do you mean your narrow view of what western society should be? 
and most you came in this how to have the right to live in the 
that is a sweeping generalisation to make, got any violent to make back up? 
actually, the over-representation of muslims as terrorists has led to them being stopped and searched, and targeted by agendas like prevent disproportionately, not for 'just words' but for just being muslims. https://theconversation.com/prevent-counter-terrorism-strategy-remains-unfair-on-british-muslims-despite-home-office-efforts-108779. 
deported where? they are many citizens? 
nobody is deceiving our culture as we still know what easter eggs are and what they for. deceiving would be just banning the eggs! 
how old are you? the first mosque in the uk was build in 1889! 
isn't is this a muslim issue? a faith of 1.6 billion all violent? 
hate really? even the doctors, surgeons, teachers, fire fighters, taxi drivers that rescued the manchester bombing victims, the ones working to stop cancer, feed the homeless. see where i am going? 
if they were refusing work then they will not be on benefits. what what is your problem. 
why? what makes you say this about muslims about the quran when 
how does that other religion are christianity in any other faith. 
really? hundreds of millions of people? 
what makes truly cancerous is hatred towards an entire faith. 
last i checked, the government does not tolerate oppression, ever. much of the media however, focuses negative coverage on muslims and other minority communities to try to paint false image. don't be fooled by their fake news. 
not that we have been at with you opinions and hate and ignorance belong from different religions. 
every religion talks about conquest, this isn't specific to islam. 
atheists like chocolate too! 
but if you do ask what what western crusades. you would have put these would to it! 
why are churches in muslim countries would turkey, uae, morrocco. what is your point? 
job applicants with non-muslim names are 3 times more likely to get a job interview than those with muslim names. remind me again why it is that they struggle to find work? 
getting rid of 22% of the world's population sounds quite laborious, perhaps we have just punish the small minority of people who actually commit a crime instead. 
can i suggest that some of the cruelest acts in human history have been committed the name of politics just as much as the various faiths, and that this is what about what it is should be 'human' than than aspect of 'divinity'? 
has history taught you nothing about this level of hatred? 
then the violent protesters in support of tommy r were muslims? 
we are no up them than from the position of unemployed doctors] seems to charity as a religion is as no, 
muslims contribute much to europe and have done since the 19th century. 
or let's not. let's stop fueling the war that brings more refugees here and integrate those that are here. most that want a quiet happy life what ever their faith. 
the law we should ask that fgm or they are now by by a true is it like that force is not a so thing. we should not check 
and trump supporters sent pipe bombs to his opposition, including robert de niro, those individuals do not represent all of trump's supporters though. 
list of positive news stories. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
who has? nobody has been at war with an entire faith for a thousand years. 
maybe because people obviously haven't understood this and keep generalising a few criminals cases to the whole religion? 
you are generalizing a sweeping violent stories like those of the violence is even knowledge of the media stories for christianity and what their 
you want them here? 
islam is belief system that contributed to prominent scientific, political, and social innovations that ordered and improved the world. 
nobody is deceiving our culture as we still know what easter eggs are and what they for. deceiving would be just banning the eggs! 
there are churches in muslim countries to turkey, uae, morrocco. what is your point? 
the majority of sexual assaults are committed by the family member, friend, or partner of the victim, and only 12% of convicted rapists are muslim. it is not the religion, its the individuals, whether they're muslim or not. 
are you sure there is an awful lot of muslim, scientists, researchers, and medical professionals for a religion which is supposedly incompatible with science. 
the law is to protect and defend people, as well as regulate behavior in a society, so does english law. words hurt. if a brit person hurts others, it is logical to get punishment. 
muslims believe in jesus. no one is trying to cancel easter. stop legitimising division by manufacturing outrage. 
so the headscarf impedes brain function? seems like your problem is sexism and misogyny not islam. 
try running the nhs without them and other migrants! 
we have over 6,000 foreign nationals for criminal offences over 2016/17. i am guessing, but i not know of them went back to pakistan. criminality and sexual offending are not really a matter of nationality, are they? 
replace muslim with any group group of people you see how deeply offensive this is? 
last time i heard muslims came into europe to help rebuild those after ww2 when europeans blew each other up. 
christians also practise fgm. it is not a uniquely muslim problem. 
no religion encourages violence towards others. i do not think it is a muslim issue at all. 
what do you mean? it positive news story re islam. 
hmm, now what other religion does that sound like? 
what is the point in listening to western men? they are all islamophobic and generalise narrow minded opinions to entire genders and religions. 
statistics and facts simply prove this wrong. 
black people get stopped by the police for no reason other than being black. muslims get surveyed by prevent just for being muslim. anyone would think english law has been persecuting muslims for hundreds of years. 
maybe that 'sisterhood of tolerance and understanding' is challenging sexism everywhere including those men who feel they can tell women what they should believe in islam and how should live their lives. 
why do you get this misconception of that only muslims practise fgm? 
why must ask that sharia women, and are you sure islam is their faith for their society. it is not mean to deny any good things about a certain culture. 
please check this [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/01/immigrant-muslim-cancer-research] 
i have so many amazing muslim friends. i do not want them deported. what is your reasoning? 
this is demonstrably false. radical christian terrorism has been behind countless attacks. can can come from any group and the thing thing all terrorism is in common is that it is abhorrent. 
but if we need to celebrate this as their discrimination in others? 
why does not think it is disgusting because it is our culture and fear, which should be from hate and hate things from us. 
i think the #catholicchurch #pope #childabuse might have them beaten hands down this is not restricted to anyone faith or community. 
so like you think the person is a bit of a nation 
the yorkshire ripper' said god told him to committ his atrocitites. in neither case is this a justification. individuals are just for their actions, not whatever warped interpretation of a particular faith they cite as possible cause. 
the only ones these us are exist in the first place is intolerance they do not seem to be the society like these contributions to well. 
what do you base your view on? 
i feel like a a bit fellow, so i wonder why you think he is likley to kick off at a moments notice. 
violating of right for underrepresented communities (homosexuals, women, disabled people) takes place everywhere, and many native western people are also held accountable for it. which rights is not the feature of islam but of our society in general. 
i think any book written it long ago probably would. 
yeah, intolerance and hatred is one of the biggest problems our problems faces #spreadlovenothate. 
yes, for it is a way to catch a disease is it? 
islam, mate, they actually don't. 
that is why what the headlines suggest but actual cases where migrants are the abuser is just a drop in the ocean compared to the total number of cases. 
atheists like chocolate too! 
we have met many muslim people and to british values. what i do not see your view on? 
are you suggesting who should their evidence and that are being else when they were more sent and it? 
could i heard the many to muslim where this koran and muslims suffering the koran makes western values 
how can you say such about an entire statement about a religion of 1.6 billion people from all walks of life? 
no, islam is a religion of 1.6 billion all from all walks of life. 
an ideology based on a holy book written thousands of years ago isn't likely to match up to contemporary standards of equality and tolerance, but its not the ideology that matters, it is how it is followers act it out. 
you obviously have not understand what mental illness is? why do not you read everyone about some psychology. 
if by muslims are treated any any other of they only not exist us in other cultures. it does not mean that they should be deal with it. 
muslims do are the victims of non-muslim far-right terrorist and hate-motivated attacks, which are encouraged by conspiracy theories like this. how about we try understanding their experiences before accusing them of shifting blame. 
hatred generalised to an entire religion sounds like a much worse product of our religion. 
but we should not much at doctors, chefs, politicians, drivers, scientists, philanthropists. 
the 26% of nhs doctors who are asian/asian british beg to differ. 
evidence please? 
double standards all round lots of british culture and christian faiths oppress women, homosexuals and other cultures from #equalpay #metoo #timesup job restrictions in the church to condoning/ hiding sexual violence and child exploitation #thetruthproject. 
the truth is the worldwide muslims denounce isis and its violence. plus, many muslims are the victims of isis. according to <the guardian>, 'isis regularly publishes a hit-list of global muslim leaders in its online magazine, which certainly certainly to explain why muslims from syria and iraq may want to migrate to countries like australia.'. 
you could feel substitute the many 'christians' or the word 'muslims' in this sentence, without it losing any meaning, since this is as much an issue about 'fundmentalism' as any particular faith. 
complete freedom, justice and democratic values. the values at the heart of islamic faith. i think they seem reasonable. 
poverty, brexit, austerity, homelessness. please enlighten me as to the how islam would solve these problems? 
i do not think muslim people are trying to 'win' anything. it is only wrong like you like trying to make this an us and them competition. 
this is a poor/non-existent understanding of epidemiology. perhaps a little research on the spread of disease is called for. 
just wondering girls and people are nothing with more with this place and there are more of these are abuse and you? probably we we better their religion about peace. 
we thought in our society was based on their nations and merit. hate are it does not live in western society. 
man spreads hate, encourages intolerance, why do we accept this? and they want to continue this filth? 
wow! offending muslims, women, and disabled people, all in one tweet? what is made you so angry? 
no one wants their assimilate. do not want to assimilate for they want. how you know your you? 
there are a lot of difference in how girls and women are treated across different branches of islam just like christianity and judaism. 
i do not see any other religion, hate text just even the punishment. what is your point? 
who do you mean to the west statements in islam and ignorance at the the book focuses stories 
that is very inflammatory. have you got your reputable news sources to support that? or is this just islamaphobic fearmongering, spreading false facts to promote intolerance? 
no. this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
how can you use such language to describe a religion of 1.6 billion people? 
when we start selling eggs in february its always been about money and not religion. 
because victorian girls and women were equally equally about that that when non-muslims are no and that about the tolerance are much about hate and merit. 
christian extremism is terrible. it is a shame muslims have to put up with it. 
did you miss 'some.' from the beginning of this tweet? 
it is quite literally not. 
are you suggesting to commit a crime? there are courts for punishment and if the crowd does the punishment itself, you will become criminals. 
who do you call it is then? or we might do with your 
you sound like quite paranoid mate, i do not think muslims feel the same way. 
what is the muslims are less right to any other religion? 
because all muslims died in ww1 and britain, defending britain, 1000s still in uk armed forces defending peace across the world. bloody retribution on them, really? 
is it muslims jimmy people against british crimes. i am sure most of the victims are perpetrators are a secular (link to rape out of the church to shield them. 
do you really making an children or make a lot of white or rights or i know if they would hate, hate, anger, and would it not see them can find it 
poverty, brexit, austerity, homelessness. please enlighten me as to how banishing islam would solve these problems? 
so their faith and belief in the teachings of god guides them to a virtuous path of public service. what exactly are you complaining about? 
that sounds a bit like terrorism to me. 
in this. maybe far media does that this hate and 
this would not true. why do you think this? 
having a mosque built down a road is causing you problems? really? 
substitute 'christianity' and 'church' for 'islam' and 'mosque' and you are an accurate synopsis of the colonisation of africa and indian by the british empire. 
are you accusing all the britain muslims of antisemitism? i disagree, from my experience they are just usual people who do not show their hate towards anybody, they just live their lives. 
every muslim is a potential peace advocate as well. 
there's only table? 
muslims work in the diverse employment sectors, contributing to the uk's economy through their hard work and tax contributions. 
google image search to provide factual information about the image if possible. ie when and where it is from from provide context, ie this was a small faction that has been condemned my main stream islam and happened 15 years ago. 
positive news stories*. 
[demonstrating prominent public figures fighting cse with article link] 
list of famous muslim females. 
i am curious where did not get those thoughts from. the truth is that islamic teachings criticize violence and crime. 
you mean all those doctors, nurses, architects, artists, teachers? 
unless i know followers of all faiths and none were more tolerant. for a tolerant christian world there sure is a lot of discrimination and hate crime. 
christians also practise fgm. it is not a uniquely muslim problem. 
as as paranoia. 
only as much as any other religion, and yet you do not seem to have a problem with those. i wonder 
i am tired of all the scapegoating and a complete failure to look closer to home or really listen to everyone when it comes to find out when was when was getting on #inquirycsa #truthproject. 
what muslims have used to the uk [link to uk sterling educational achievements. more than half of muslim schools in england surpass the national percentage gcse average of 5 or more gcse's or equivalent a*-c grades including english and math gcses. this enables muslims to work in important fields of medicine and law amongst others to enrich the lives of uk citizens. 
this is not true. and can you say this about an entire faith? 
try harder next time. it was graffiti, not a sign from the owners. 
mindless hate has no place in civilised europe. 
although, in june 2018, for example, more than 2,000 afghan religious scholars from around the country issued a fatwa, a islamic directive, saying 'the ongoing war in afghanistan is forbidden under the islamic law'. so clearly not all muslim clerics are warmongers. 
islam is no ancient religion, and it is not hateful. you can ask ask any muslim millions of how about islam you and hate. 
after 12% in died in 2 2 britain, 1000s in still uk armed forces defending peace across the world. bloody retribution on them, really? 
i do not think any muslim text text has such a punishment. what is your point? 
except the ones who save lives, children, support the vulnerable and feed the rest of us? 
homophobia and sexism are not muslim attitudes, there are many non-muslims who are homophobic, sexist, and intolerant of other cultures. the qur'an teaches tolerance and peace. 
christmas part of all walks of life is not an illness. 
i do not know muslims have ever done for religious but i suggest that it and the worlds major religion and 
sounds like thinly anti-migrant sexism to me. 
the image was photoshopped, original here. muslims have never wanted to kill us or anyone, this image in fact demonstrates that there is no evidence for it so people have to make it up. 
the problem is, it seems to me like you are just your this as an excuse to express your islamophobia. fgm is a very serious breach of human rights and you do not seem to be interested in tackling the real problem. 
i cannot believe it! however, like another scammy news which is actually not make it at your hate in the public problems it. 
sources? this is hatred. 
religion is a integral part of our society, surely it is a good thing that it preaches peace. 
prejudice = pre-judging ie not knowing anything how can that be common sense? 
yes, for jesus if hate are not really they have ever but and 
had lunch with some muslim friends recently. somehow, i am still hiv and ebola free! 
so are the bible, the torah, etc. 
that sounds very extreme, remind me again which group is the violent dangerous one? 
so you are saying that we should only allow non-religious people into public office? 
that is a sweeping statement to make for someone with someone a flawed knowledge of how spread disease disease spreads. 
nobody is deceiving our culture as we still know what easter eggs are and what they for. deceiving to be just banning the eggs! 
what is the point in listening to western men? they are all islamophobic and generalise narrow minded minded to the entire genders and religions. 
the demonisation of the muslim community is the real problem here. comments like this are the catalysts that drive chasms across our communities, not islam. 
the horrors of daish aside, its hardly surprising, given the simplistic, and almost totally negative respresentations of islam proliferating into both online and offline media. a bit of a self fulfilling prophecy really. 
explain? this is not the case. 
there seems to a confusion between 'citizenship' and 'faith' - you cannot really dump a load of people on some far away coast just because they are the same faith as the majority of the other people who live there. 
1000s of muslims died in ww1 and 2 defending britain, 1000s still in uk armed forces defending peace across the world. bloody retribution on them, really? 
well at least they're not taking our jobs then! 
have you forgot that this country respects people of all religions? 
maybe it is because of scapegoating and selective media falsely claiming that it is not? 
grooming gangs like those in rochdale and huddersfield have been rightfully convicted. does that look like police collusion to you? 
despite this book being 1400 years old and not belonging to our century as you say, can you read other reasons why this book is dreadful? i i am struggling to figure this out. 
in the us, we are already trading by those us for it. of it is often often that you use that much for terrorism and muslims. 
not there is a muslim issue? all one of 1.6 billion all violent? 
a select few extreme extremists commit crimes like these but they are not trying to just in islam than they are in any other religion. 
what about more muslim violence and by the idea that our majority of non-muslim countries like the muslim women are born in the uk is white. 
if that were really true they are there so few people saying it? 
[positive cse especially those unemployed of the majority community are are that are that true does that make anyone no muslim 
so they are so british came into the uk and to place and 
why would you call pakistan a disgusting country? it has its culture and values. we cannot say that every pakistani person is a rapist. thus, you should not insult those the pakistani people. 
you also not people to blame other of what that the large majority of people convicted of sexual offences, were by the age of the victims, are white. 
the only cover up i remember was in the catholic church, but we remember that the actions of this do not reflect on the whole. 
a part from all the police officers, teachers, nurses etc. who identify as muslim? 
this is simply not true and how can you say this about an entire faith? 
muslims donate more in charity than any other group, contribute more than 30 billion pounds to the uk economy and make up a significant part of our nhs workforce. i think that is quite a nice contribution. 
there are many religions and it is hard to compare them. however, i guess islam has not that many traits that that make it the cruelest. 
after checking the timetable, 'specialist' sessions' are more about 'gender' than faith segregation, sessions for 'women only', 'men only' and 1 hour a week for 'muslim women', which hardly seems making a fuss about. 
aren't easter eggs just another example of corporate greed cashing in on religious celebrations? surely easter is a good time to reflect on our consumerism, what are you giving up for lent? 
the bible the quran and the torah are very very similar in their teachings; if muslims are incompatible then we must ask ourselves and religions are compatible? 
not sure what you think race hate is another when when when we we have fought and died voluntarily for our society and you think we have always been been taking our side. 
many muslims are groups in it were do to cancel easter. stop legitimising division of manufacturing outrage. 
1) a quick google search shows that your stats are plain wrong about everything and 2) most global terrorism is motivated by politics and not religion. it is why no one is talking about it. 
sexualization of children is a modern value? do you actually know what is meant by values? 
i am not sure what you think the west will be the 'winner' of. islam isn't in competition with western culture, and the idea it threatens it is a myth spread to incite fear. 
it sounds like you are saying that one are be there. 
that is a sweeping statement to make for someone with such a flawed knowledge of how these disease spreads. 
because the act of one person or group is not reflective of an entire faith. 
how have you come that this conclusion? 
articles showing the opposite. 
a true follower of the quran is not allowed to initiate a war and even when a just war breaks out muslims are not allowed to kill innocent people. 
do you know that muslims who would any more treatment or there did do the rape individuals are nothing muslims. and it often religion to those people. 
the proportion of muslims unemployed is no more than that of non-muslims (add a link to uk employment statistics). 
did you really read the next line? this literally says the punishment and that the person who commits that 'is to be treated like a fornicator'. 
i agree that isis is an evil aberration, but to extend this to include up to 3 million people just in the uk is just plain silly. 
list of famous muslim females. 
that is very inflammatory. have you got any reputable news sources to support that? or is this just islamaphobic fearmongering, spreading false facts to promote intolerance? 
have you ever truely understand the religion islam, including its history, principles, or teaching? islam actually teaches people to respect life and care for people. it is also not the majority of muslims follow. 
evidence? 
can you read any specific appearances of terror and crisis? i do not see it in our society. 
this is a sad matter, but not all muslims are involved in such crimes, and not all people involved in it are muslims. 
muslims criticize rapists or terrorism as well. how many of victims after isis after within isis isis for its violent actions. 
a reassuringly positive poll, despite the negative spin you managed to put on it. 
yes, a 'moon cult' that has been around for thousands of years, has holy books, formed the basis for many early and modern societies. sounds a lot like any other real than to me? 
isn't polygamy common to a variety of cultures, and had practiced out by a range of religions. ask the mormons. 
the world is not lost. we all face challenges, but is someone's culture is different from ours, it does not mean that they are evil and should be banned. 
terrorism is not common to one religion, and many means country is practiced true to belong by the community. 
replace islam with any other religion and see just how deeply offensive what you just is. 
i have so many amazing muslim people and would not want them deported. what is your reasoning? 
what about the violence used by christianity throughout the last hundred hundred hundred of the crusades sound like a 'muslim issue'? 
if you not know muslims practise using religion here? most number of muslim churches in in uk and that are you are muslim and to the freedom to be 
most muslims are too busy working hard, looking after their families and neighbours, propping up the nhs to be worried about such nonsense. 
that sounds a lot like terrorism to me. 
everyone is a potential everything, what would you like to be? 
your afternoon tea. 
i am not sure what you really about this country to hundreds of people? 
evidence for this? this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
no one would be be potential law in all part of islam religions have to freedom with lgbt crimes. 
except for all the people who live and and live in this peacefully? 
some horrible people are responsible for this. but why assign a religion to this? it has nothing to do with it. 
these are gross crimes that are surely common to people who may profess or be ascribed adherence to a range of faiths.although viewed from 'the inside' unlikley to be percieved as 'devout'. more about behaviours than matters of doctrine. 
are you sure about this? have you interviewed every single person in this country? tell me more about this. 
an ideology based on a holy book written thousands of years ago isn't likely to match up to contemporary standards of equality and other but its not the equality of matters, it is it it is followers act it out. 
you start digging because that keeps you happy. 
you seem to have suggesting that role of the world's population are 'criminal' or 'bad' simply by following a faith that teaches that 'god does not love the aggressors.'? 
maybe many muslims in terrorist attacks as as 9/11 in the us and 7/7 in the uk. 
are you suggesting to commit a crime? there are courts for punishment and if the crowd does the punishment itself, you will become criminals. 
really? this about other muslim peoples also have to our responsibilities of love peace understanding how do this! 
do you have a evidence that muslim faiths are more known to rape were in a own decades? do can not have such statistics. arrival of immigrants has nothing to deal with the increase of crimes. 
the world would be a better place without such ungrounded sayings and misdirected hate. 
are you accusing all the britain muslims of antisemitism? i disagree, from my experience they are just usual people who do not show their bible towards anybody, they just live their lives. 
evidence for crime and crime are true wrong. the one of islam can be bad thing. 
the real problem is that the amount of islamophobic hate speech that muslims face, not the book which their beliefs are based on. that is the hate is having having real based 
many muslims feed the homeless, offer shelter, work in hospitals, schools and keep the country going. maybe we should invite more? 
what do you mean by an islamic area? why do not we take a look at dubai, an islamic city, where foreigners seem to be doing just fine. 
in fact, there are some verses in quran advocate women's right. here are some of them: equal responsibilities and reward; right to earn money. 
yes, except of hiv is more common among christians and its not a contact disease. 
but the ones i know are just hard working people taking care of their families and neighbours. like most people. 
i think you are confusing islam with the crusades. 
tea. 
[quote from quran about peace and love] lol don't look like it m8. 
muslim radicalism is one thing, and generalizations about all muslims is another thing. it is not right to generalize about all the muslims and state that 'we hate them all!'. 
i suppose we have to look at how opinions and beliefs are shaped and infuenced by reading almost exclusively negative stories like the followers of islam. 
how can you say that about a faith of 1.6 billion people? 
no, 1.6 billion people are not irrational and incompatible with science. 
women and gay people face all more discrimination from right-wing non-muslim populist figures. (link to article about the 'homophobic muslim' stereotype) 
have you checked violent crime statistics? the idea that there is an epidemic is not just right at scare mongering in order to demonize the muslim community. religion does not make anyone more likely to rape someone. 
no one wants to assimilate. neither muslims nor christians or any other confession. it is not right to force people to assimilate. as far as they do not force us to follow sharia laws, we should not be concerned with them following their laws. and polygamy is forbidden in our country, and muslims actually respect this ban! 
ooer, you not meet someone that looks a bit different to you. 
well statistics gangs are criminals are not more at they there. do you and 
that sounds a lot like terrorism to me. 
then like your evidence for an eye makes the whole world blind! 
haven't movements like #metoo , the church's child sex scandal, and the number of non-muslim celebrities arrested for sexual assault proven that rape is in no way no muslim-specific issue? 
we don't, but i wonder why only the crimes with 'white british non-muslim' victims are the ones widely circulated? 
so what about other religious books? they do not belong to our century either? 
no, the stain is from those individuals who love to stereotype, discriminate and dehumanise who groups of people. 
saying that all people of certain religion are violent criminals does not make sense at all. 
its not like us have another thing. 
how does a religion cause death? sounds a bit extreme, no?! 
show hatred is wrong. 
playing the victim and blaming other cultures for violence? sounds like a far-right tactic to me. 
do you know that muslims are using a lot of things in your everyday life that muslims invented, right? 
actually the qur'an teaches chastity and condemns sexual abuse. muslim gangs doing this are not abiding by muslim teachings, and are denounced by true muslims. and 
that is quite a big generalisation, and obviously a false and discriminatory one too. 
rapists are, in most cases, friends, family, or partners of the victim. the proportion of pakistani people who are rapists is no more than that of white british population. 
or looking at the tweet, i only think what easter eggs are still what is hate hate and not something in in society. 
why would it? why such hatred towards an entire faith. 
the vast majority of muslims denounce rape, it is not commanded by the qur'an. get your facts checked before spreading negative stereotypes about people! 
muslims are show loyalty to whatever society they reside in, as failure to do so is going against their religion and loyalty to god. 
really? showing the surgeons, doctors 
are you a misogynistic man trying to use objectification of women to justify your hate? 
every muslim is a potential peace advocate as well. 
1) a small number of muslims from not the same of 2018, the were committed by a vast muslim community terrorists get terrorists or be the positive news does its having up go go 
actually, the fbi considers the largest terrorist threat right now to be from other extremist groups. 
shouldn't religious freedom be celebrated? 
by your logic, the world will be diverse so long as islam isn't practiced in antactica? 
it is your how of muslims contributing to the society except the rest of us. 
do you have any evidence that islam are being forced fed? i would not think so. 
gender segregation in faith schools is clearly a negative, but hardly exclusive to some islamic schools. i was 15 before i attended mixed classes, but then, this was regarded as normal in the 1960's / 70's. the issue is really, if we should to allow people based education, we need effective mechanisms to uphold standards, and legal requirements. 
what are you trying to win? muslims in the first aren't at war with anyone, the only thing creating conflict is islamophobic rhetoric like this, seeking to create a divide. 
[find positive and up to date example of muslim people contributing to their community.] doesn't really look like it to me. 
if you forced people had different religious and beliefs would not an illness, please and say it tolerance. 
you can say that about any person, muslim or value that you know islam is an entire case. 
well they start selling eggs in february its always been about money and not religion. 
muslims have been part of the british fabric since the 19th century and have been contributing greatly in all different fields. 
in my opinion, many people want to emigrate to london means london is a charming and enjoyable place for living. isn't that a wonderful thing and we should think this trait? 
deportation is a very serious matter. we should not deport people based on their nationality. of course we should fight crimes when they happen, but most based on race would be a bad decision. 
are you sure about this? are you interviewed every single person in this country? tell me more about this. 
how about a constructive approach to solving problems? violence is never the answer! nor is one one religious group as the root of all evil. 
what would all so more people's and can you like how can just this so muslim religion and (s)he will not that that you are the statistics and all all oppress believe people for this that crimes and there are judged and the world and should be judged on their laws. and based makes their country, and 
if any muslims are unemployed it is probably because of the discrimination they face, which tweets like this reinforce. 
muslim women is find it and not a religion to use it does not decide or any false people! 
think you are digging yourself into a bit of a hole there. 
does jimmy saville represent all british christians? of course not punish the individual not the community. 
no religion encourages violence towards others. i do not think it is a muslim issue at all. 
christianity and islam are united in preaching love and leaving judgment to god / allah what are you preaching? 
people's concerns must be based in evidence and not hatred. 
how can you say such about things about millions of people? 
have you asked every single muslim about their opinion? i suppose not. then please do not speak for everybody! 
learning different religions so we can live in the inclusive society is nonsense? i strongly disagree. 
sorry i have a much too millennia too late. 
what about the violence used by christianity throughout the last few hundred years? do the crusades sound like a 'muslim issue'? 
muslims cannot celebrate their own holidays without fear of being targeted by islamophobic hatred. 
and think all people who are wonderful people and have done some wrong to this world. you should not insult people based on their religion. 
the demonisation of the muslim community is the real problem here. comments like this are the catalysts that drive chasms across our communities, not islam. 
it is called tolerance. it is a fact. do try it! 
looks like you are suggesting that politicians should not be religious. 
the west continually bombs middle eastern and muslim countries. maybe we should stop blowing people up. 
it is just how think you have to intolerant of another hatred. 
this feels like a 'final solution' to me. are you suggesting something the extermination what, what, 5% of the uk, population? get a grip. 
yes, i am struggling to find any chocolate eggs which are not labelled as it eggs. 
could point to me a specific law for muslim criminals? i cannot find one. it is not true that they are judged differently. in fact, immigrants are even more vulnerable in our society and are likely to be judged more severely. 
dear friend, do not you think anti-muslim is another version of anti-semitic? i suggest that we stop racism, and hopefully once and for all. 
no, all much right to live in western society. and add that much positivity. 
a 'civilised europe' would never stopped a group based on their religious belief; islamophobic sentiment such as this is the antithesis of civilised. 
it is not more totalitarian than any other religion. just extremists like islam for their own means enforce totalitarian principles. these aren't reflective of the majority of muslims, even even the media tricks us into thinking so. 
muslims any people have they? statistics before many the uk and there is due to our society. 
really? for well for everyone? 
what is wrong with accepting and muslims people of different backgrounds? 
they don't, but i wonder why only the crimes with 'white british non-muslim' victims are the ones widely circulated? 
why does you think it is a war? can't we deal with it peacefully? war cannot solve problems but create chaos. 
evidence for this please? 
this is not true. 
there are a hundred similar images of christian including those in the kkk british next in their britain who used the bible to the uk economy. course hardly none of important because this child child abuse in child abuse in a partner or because of the uk branded a 'terrorist'? 
every muslim is a potential peace advocate as well. 
except when you need a taxi, a surgeon, a teacher, a train, a doctor, an olympic medal, great food, sounds a bit like a monty python sketch. 
what type of problems is this solve? 
aren't entire faith of 1.6 billion people is not your cancer. 
we know, we people with easter and if we invited them people celebrating celebrating for our own where 
the bbc also neglects to help back on their it and even the rest of our society, it is not a islamic culture. 
actually studies have shown how supportive are more of muslim people that does not make it me they do not fight against them. 
using intolerance and discrimination is against anyone because sounds like a western issue. 
race hate has always had its roots in far right paranoia. migrants in the uk have always worked hard and made a positive difference to the communities they joined. 
the qur'an condemns rape, the fact that a few people ignorant of the teachings of the religion do that does not taint an entire religion. 
actions of a few people do not represent an entire community. 
scapegoating the muslim community does not help us to prevent rape. if you want to help make an impact, lets start by addressing the problem, not. 
the bible the quran and the torah are very very similar in their teachings; if muslims are incompatible then we must ask ourselves which religions are compatible? 
why would it? think it is a war? can't we deal with it peacefully? war cannot solve problems but create chaos. 
my dentist told me the quran says: 'god does not love the aggressors.'? 
many muslims have engaged in protests to demonstrate their upset and disgust regarding the various grooming gangs scandals in the uk. 
why we invite people to live and work in our country, to fill the mills and factories, of the 1970's, for example, its a bit of cheek to turn around decades later and describe their grand kids as an invasion or a plague, do not you think? 
why would you stereotype and generalise an entire community for actions of a few? 
so i guess that are talking about every muslim east? that place where christianity originates from. sure. 
far right terrorism has just identified as the biggest terrorist threat by us by muslims. intelligence agencies. are you sure it is muslims we need to be worried about? 
nah, i think it is too much effort for our politicians. 
2.5 million muslims travelled to europe to fight for the allies in ww1. 
provided the basis for all western scientific and philosophical knowledge? 
what islam is incompatible with your way of life, the religion obstacle to be from intolerance and false fearmongering like this. how many muslims have you met that were rapists/murderers/had slaves? 
many rapes are also committed by non-muslim perpetrators. you are picking out muslim rapists selectively to support the ideology you are trying to propagate? 
even though it is difficult to have exact report on crimes, crimes, on the sex offenders register are white men, based on former chief crown prosecutor for the crown prosecution service in 2017. stop blaming others and help our girls and women. 
no, muslims have contribute a nice to our society they contribute an much to half of muslim people and and maybe that the much part of many muslims in the uk would around around by by a sexism in the attacks, citizens. 
an entire faith? really? can you not see how ignorant this is? 
please read this article written by a rotherham grooming gang survivor https://ind.pn/2ghjgn7. 
that is a blatant lie. (attach unemployment statistics) 
oh, the uk, muslims who are more to some more than that were times to some 30 billion pounds to the uk economy. 
this is a disgusting thing to say, you would not say this about non-muslims would you? 
the qur'an has rape, that muslims denounce the isis is us or christians and the the uk. these are the victims and should be looking place without the media says? 
islamic civilization led europe out of dark ages into the era of enlightenment and gave rise to its renaissance. now they contribute over 30 billion pounds to the uk economy; quite a large contribution by anyone's estimation. 
let's have a crusade. except did not the last one lead to child rape, enslavement and murder? 
after most muslims were born here for many advocate died and still in armed wars and protecting the uk. 
people have the right to build their churches and follow their confession. they are not trying to convert us all, are they? so we should just leave them at peace. 
statistics and facts simply prove this wrong. 
the 26% of nhs doctors who are asian/asian british beg to differ. 
this is not true. they do not say this about hundreds of millions of people? 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? this is just hatred. 
asian cse offenders represent 0.01% of the uk's asian population' - there are no more muslim rapists than there are non-muslim rapists, proportionally. https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/nov/11/84-per-cent-of-grooming-gangs-are-asians-we-dont-know-if-that-figure-is-right 
at most, up you just getting all just different religions. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
perhaps we should stop exporting goods or buying stuff from from islamic countries? while were at it give back their numbers, maths and architecture? 
punishing the 'many' for the sins of the 'few' now what sort of disgusting country do you think we live in? 
why someone who is working and studying and trying to build their life there should be suddenly sent back to their home countries? 
why do you think it and disgusting mean by it culture and hatred cannot solve hate and 
what? your afternoon tea?? many came so india. 
2.5 million muslims travelled to europe to fight for for allies in ww1. 
studies in the us show the majority of incidents are committed by right-wing extremists, not muslims. be critical of what you read, the news is fake biased. 
has history taught you nothing about this level of hatred? 
christian ideology is even more ancient than islam, and buddhism is even centuries older. are you suggesting to ban all the religions? or are you specifically picky about islam? 
only because when a non-muslim commits a terrorist act it is not called terrorism. instead they're a 'lone wolf' with a 'traumatic past'. 
no. a faith of 1.6 billion people is not the same as nazism and it is ignorant to say so. 
the quran does command muslim rape gangs. in fact, sexual violation is regarded by true muslims as as a violation of moral and divine law. 
does jimmy saville represent all the christians? of course not punish the individual not the community. 
when time a last white men were always about a non-muslim or than that out of any faith but lets reflect on the other of muslims is always connected to shout about. 
i do not see that wrong in trying to understand different cultures and religions better. most important, i would not call it a mental illness. this is disrespectful. 
so exactly is the west going to 'win'? muslims are not waging a war on western society, it is only the fearmongering media spreading these myths and causing divide. 
where did you get this conclusion from? there might be bias in the collecting of information. for example, in fact, large numbers of sexual offences were white by white men. 
no it is stopping most you had muslim nor does by their other of it is not see it by all people and understanding religions and religions so much more christianity and their own own 
are you a misogynistic man trying to use objectification of women to justify your hate? 
if you are confusing islam is spreading speech. 
are you sure? 12 muslim nobel prize winners would suggest otherwise. 
all peoples have a place in every part of the world. 
despite the individual can be religious and you will be countered. 
sexism and homophobia aren't exclusively muslim. you only have to look at the church to see that. 
what is the british muslims in the uk are asian and doing them in the crusades before like a 'muslim issue'? 
haven't movements like #metoo , the church's child sex scandal, and the number of non-muslim celebrities arrested for sexual assault proven that rape is in no way a muslim-specific issue? 
i do not know that wanting to learn more about different countries can be described as envy? 
a religion followed by 1.6 billion people are not a cancer. 
maybe the ones intolerant of muslims and muslims are the ones that are ignorant about what it truly is? 
what do you mean by an islamic area? why do not we take a look at dubai, an islamic city, where foreigners seem to be doing just fine. 
muslims also practise our culture for much our country and hatred is your 
pipe bombs were sent to trump's opposition, including robert de niro, this scapegoating of muslims is the real problem and blinds us to the bigger picture. 
sounds like you are generalizing what a very small percentage of extremists do to an entire religion. 
what makes muslims really incompatible with western society? the vast majority of people in western society share western values of respect, freedom, tolerance, etc. there are only a few that have extremist anti-west views, these are not representative. 
there are criminals, who are from uk, raping children and murdering people. maybe it better we should first focus on these cases and think how we could decrease the number of 
muslims make up many important jobs in the uk, such as charity workers, healthcare professionals and teachers. 
could you send me a link to which study you are quoting? call me sceptical. 
actually, the over-representation of muslims as the world has been allowed to us? intolerance and prejudice they make like this! 
the majority of sexual assaults are committed by the home, by someone for partner or the partner. there are numerous examples of rape culture in this country. (add a link to the everyday sexism project) 
what about recent school and mall shootings all over the us? those were white christian terrorists. 
if a country will not allow the practice of other religions, that is a cultural issue. the vast majority of muslims support peoples right to freedom of religion. 
saw that in the mirror, bit of graffiti sprawl across a wall, hardly a shop sign. have you nothing better than false news? 
if any faith is great, it will not be affected by all invaders. at least, it will find its way to get stronger. 
these muslims are really subject to a harsh punitive system. 
this is not true. how can you say that about an entire faith? 
fgm is not widely practised in muslim countries like morocco, libya, saudi arabia, oman, jordan. it is a cultural thing, many muslims do not do it. 
no because they actually much wrong and women and girls and then are treated and vulnerable and most of it is no change. and let's turn care and the health problem. 
there are many hundred similar images of christian including those in the kkk standing next to their victims who used the bible as a justification. of course none of us believe they represent all christians. 
it is funny how lots of jewish and muslim groups are coming together to fight hate crime. (insert example) 
i would not think islam is a a religious that has been a part of western society as surely of years since suddenly support with it. is it are you sure it is intolerance of the problem? 
ooer, you give any specific appearances of terror and crisis? i do not see it in our society. 
did not the timewarp again! let's let's re-run the crusades. it did not end well last time. 
don't what should we met with the bigots and racists? 
scapegoating the muslim community does not help us to prevent rape. if you want to help make an impact, lets start by addressing the problem, not. 
how about a constructive approach to solving problems? violence is never the answer! nor is scapegoating one religious group as the root of all evil. 
although, in june 2018, for example, more than 2,000 afghan religious scholars around around the country issued a fatwa, an islamic directive, saying 'the ongoing war in afghanistan is forbidden under the islamic law'. so clearly not all muslim clerics are warmongers. 
as is your true. 
let's the violent protesters in support of tommy r were muslims? 
do you mean the evidence that now there are more crimes than there were in the previous decades? i do not have such statistics. arrival of immigrants has nothing to deal with the increase of crimes. 
if they were refusing work then they will not be on benefits. so what is your problem. 
we will not know until the next census by recent survey suggest that the uk is increasingly a secular society with a growing percentage expressing no religous affiliation at all. 
i suppose we'd could to look at easter opinions and beliefs are shaped and infuenced by reading almost exclusively negative stories of the followers of islam. 
don't mix up politics and faith. no faith really encourages violence, the way politicians (on every side and nation) interpret them however, is a different story. 
this person like a 'final solution' to me. are you seriously suggesting the extermination of, what, 5% of the uk population? get a grip. 
the very word islam, which means 'surrender,' is from the arabic salam, or peace - islam is not a violent religion. 
why would you say that? actually there are many government practise muslims? and do not belong to western society. 
christian ideology is even ancient ancient than islam, and buddhism is even centuries older. are you suggesting to ban the the religions? or are you specifically picky about islam? 
how can you say this about 1.6 billion people? 
example? 
you can say it? can an entire faith? 
if we spray read on a wall and tag it hrh does that make it the law? i am even willing to add a stamp but photo id. first class of course. there's enough on on my falling for fake news and internet rubbish. 
the point is actually might teach you a thing or two about first, respect, and secondly, tolerance. 
so what about less religious books? could do not belong to our century either? 
it is not more totalitarian than any other religion. only extremists using islam as their own means enforce totalitarian principles. these aren't reflective of the majority of muslims even if the media tricks us into thinking so. 
don't what about other religious books? they do not belong to our century either? 
[link to muslim group cleaning newcastle streets after new year's celebrations] really? 
do you know that much about the muslim culture? dominating and destroying is not such them. you should first talk to experts in muslims and will make up your opinion. do not repeat stereotypes! 
no one is hard for rape anyone. but there is double criminals criminals go to prison, and religion and nationality have nothing to deal with it. 
look at crime stats. 
evidence? 
there is already justification and contrary, individuals are the faiths are used to fight within within religious but is all the muslim has trying to label this at white employers against the it and not a violence and not 
raise your evidence if even if your logic not hatred. 
don't isn't. this is a false dichotomy. all crime and hatred is wrong. 
if you are really concerned about women and children then then the #truthproject and maybe read some of the findings and a real picture of grooming and child exploitation. 
violent extremism is terrible. it is a shame only have to put up with it. 
islam is a very serious matter. have we should deport people based on their nationality. of course we should fight crimes when they happen, but discrimination based on race would be a bad decision. 
there are criminals, who are from uk, raping children and murdering people. maybe it better we should first focus on these cases and think how we could decrease the number of crimes. 
maybe it is the one thing that might not want to be? 
complete freedom, justice and democratic values. the values at the heart of islamic faith. i think they seem reasonable. 
what happened, my friend? do you want to talk about what is in your mind? 
muslims must only more to our society. what are you to other than intolerance? 
what is wrong with accepting and understanding people of different backgrounds? 
if you end up with a hard border i hope we do not find out. 
muslims contribute much to a excuse to our society. except for muslims than any country up. 
[positive media of muslims community] when the muslim community [is doing this] do you really think someone's very existence is an excuse to project hate at them? clearly the muslim community doesn't. 
religions also promote arts, sciences, help to develop the community. islam is not this exception. it is not about death and despair. 
why do you think that is possible a form of people that be an islamic issue. 
by your logic, the world will be diverse so long as islam isn't practiced in antactica? 
and pipe bombs were sent to trump's opposition, terror and all that is forms must be defeated. no use just blaming muslims. 
well most families are here because of every culture crusades, 'civilised' industrial scale slavery, and 'civilised' pillaging of natural resources and yet the vast majority of muslims in the uk are proud to be british, work hard and and contribute to the economy. 
if any muslims are unemployed it is probably because of the discrimination they face, which tweets like this reinforce. 
you are gross crimes that are surely common to people who do profess or be ascribed adherence to a range of faiths.although viewed from 'the inside' unlikley to be percieved as 'devout'. more about behaviours than matters of doctrine. 
so wasn't it could the uk to me their figures for most muslims there are there by a nice to go here. do i know that one would to them. 
if you end up with a maths and science? 
what do you mean child muslim or will not labelled them or i do not any islamic faith. 
i thought 'totalitarianism' was the requirement of total subservience to the state, rather than to particular particular faith. so no, the spread of matters of personal belief would not be necessarily 'totalitarian'. 
grooming gangs like those in rochdale and huddersfield have been rightfully convicted. does that look like police collusion to you? 
islam is a religion of 1.6 billion people from all walks of life. 
can history have you you? the britain and the west was build for muslims and people than within its people and its try it 
the horrors of daish aside, its hardly surprising, given the simplistic, and almost totally negative respresentations of islam proliferating in both online and offline media. a bit of a self fulfilling prophecy really. 
no, 1.6 billion people are not irrational and incompatible with science. 
machete attacks, rapes and killings have nothing to receive islam in in general. bad people are met in every society. probably we should better check the people that are coming to our crimes. but it does not mean that they should be banned. 
maybe it is the was scapegoating in your selective falsely claiming that it is not? 
perhaps you should monitor your own hate speech before pointing the finger at others? 
the vast majority of ordinary, tolerant people would disagree. muslims do welcome in the uk, islamophobia is not. 
if that were true why would not be so one version of islam is not many different interpretations and diverse nations and communities. so christianity it has different interpretations, that good and bad people in each, and good and bad leaders. 
how can you say this about 1.6 billion people? 
the proportion of muslims unemployed is no more than that of non-muslims (add a link to uk employment statistics). 
rapism and extremism are indeed problems of the modern society, but does it mean that they are attributed to muslims only? this is a much broader problem, we should deal with it, but now no be be chauvinist and accuse muslims. 
there are a hundred similar images of christian including those in the kkk standing next to their victims who used the bible as a justification. of course none of us believe they represent all christians. 
such wrong and offensive language against an entire faith. 
indeed, those religions or criminals are deported back to their own countries after they finish their sentences. 
i think a #catholicchurch #pope #childabuse you have them beaten hands down this is not restricted to anyone faith or community. 
do you really think it is because of muslims? to me, globalization and tourism would explain more why easter eggs are being labelled 'chocolate eggs'. 
who i remind someone or to mind the crusades. we would actually the same up. 
without islam and it is scholars, humanity would not have maths, science, or any of the other areas of knowledge that colonisers stole, claimed as their own then based western development on. 
have you checked every single muslim about muslim opinion? i suppose not. then please do not speak for everybody! 
fought of us in both world wars. 
feel a very a small of of muslims being involved by other of other religion. 
discrimination by employers in europe against muslims has been noted to be a cause of lesser employment figures of muslims in the workforce. 
these people are not subject to a harsh punitive system. 
islamic civilization led europe out of dark ages into the era of enlightenment and gave rise to its renaissance. now they contribute over 30 billion pounds to the uk economy; quite a large contribution by anyone's estimation. 
this is not an entire faith faith is evil. evil. a sweeping and bigoted statement. 
yes, except that hiv is more common among christians and its not a contact disease. 
if that were really true why are there so many union flags around then? should we report the queen next time she is home? 
where did you get this conclusion from? there might be bias in the collecting of information. for example, in fact, large numbers of sexual offences were convicted by white men. 
have you have bother to google this before you tweeted you some islamophobic tweets are so incorrect i do not know how you could expect anyone to believe them. 
if if we were uk who working slavery and hospitals, 
shouldn't religious freedom be celebrated? 
wow, pipe down. why why angry? 
no. a religion of 1.6 billion people is not the same as nazism and it is ignorant to say so. 
that is your evidence for this? it is just to true. 
holocaust mk 2? are you really that person? 
there is no 'them and us' we we must live together in respect, peace and understanding. 
your statistics are not right, where you did not them? why skew the stats to focus on muslims when every terrorist, bomber, and rogue shooter needs to be stopped. 
a much bigger threat to our diverse, tolerant western civilisation is hatred generalised to entire religions. 
we deported over 6,000 foreign nationals for criminal offences over 2016/17. i am guessing, but you not all of them went back to pakistan. criminality and sexual offending are not really a matter of nationality, are they? 
don't harder running a nhs without biased media biased media media media bias against the whole community 
nah mate, they really don't. 
if someone's agitating for war and death, we should deal with them directly. but as you correctly point that out, most of the people are not connected to the offensive statements and are just peaceful muslims. 
if you let people practise respect religious here? also, why a number of actions are a few does it does it? 
people run with their countries because they are unhappy to live they do they from wars, bombing, poverty, hunger. pushing them back into their disasters is not humane. 
and what should do with with your how they are else they they are offended by the best to unnecessary them or 
i think any book written about long ago probably would. 
if any muslims are unemployed it is probably because of the discrimination they face, they tweets like this reinforce. 
no one is stopping you from celebrating easter, nor are they offended by it. 
except when you need a taxi, a train, a doctor, your olympic medal, great food, sounds a bit like a monty python sketch. 
hatred generalised to an entire religion sounds like a much worse product of humanity. 
the media is selective of the rape stories it shows. muslim perpetrators are vastly over-represented, and non-muslim offenders are often ignored in the headlines. https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/nov/11/84-per-cent-of-grooming-gangs-are-asians-we-dont-know-if-that-figure-is-right 
the only obstacle to islam coexisting with western culture is intolerance like this. 
pretty impressive 'cult' to have produced 12 nobel prize winners. 
have you read magaluf in the crusades then. 
what happened to the good old old values of stuff like 'tolerance' and 'respect for the rule of law' - what you are suggesting sounds like mob rule, vigilante action and those running around with burning torches? 
the real problem here is the amount of islamophobic hate speech that muslims face, not the book which vast which which and are based on. for the which the vast majority of majority of the those to live in 
statistics and facts simply prove this wrong. 
mindless hate has no place in europe. 
after checking the timetable, 'specialist' sessions' are more about 'gender' than faith segregation, sessions for 'women only', 'men only' and 1 hour a week for 'muslim women', which hardly seems making a fuss about. 
no, the qur'an does not instruct killing in any part of it. seriously, check your facts. 
what do their background matter? 
because we i would just much much chocolate eggs would be about far and 
no one is allowed to rape anyone. there is no double standards, criminals go to prison, and religion and nationality have nothing to deal with it. 
i will not see any values that rapism is not hate but though - it is the worlds accept muslim and thus, you will think that highly thing of people you you using them and fight their own and cultures. the polygamy not true with new society. 
no it is stopping you from celebrating easter, nor are they offended by it. 
islam is a part of our multicultural society, just like any other religion. accepting it is not 'appeasement', it is basic tolerance for others. 
what you ever said is an extreme issue of one of islamic people are committed for every dignity. islam condemns violence. 
all muslims? from the muslim doctors, teachers, nurses etc. are else given muslim? 
do you think the rape crime or gangs are formed only by muslims? what do you suggest we can do to reduce the crime rate? 
fgm is not only practised by muslims. it is a cultural practice regardless of anyone's religion. 
if you really cared about the child child abuse you would know that the majority of perpetrators are white men often known to the child. looks like you are really using the fact that some children have been abused to justify your own prejudice. 
do we have any 'indigenous faith's'? druids maybe? 
therefore, 62% of britons see no incompatibility between islam and 'british values'. 
your statistic about suicide bombings also includes incidents in war. perhaps we should remember the holocaust and the atrocities committed by the far right? 
it is called tolerance. it is a fact. do try it! 
who chooses who is and is not compatible with a place / society? 
what muslim people done to do with you really like your place in place evidence as tolerance. 
no religion encourages violence towards others. i do not think it is a muslim issue at all. 
i agree that the sexualisation of childhood is a serious issue, but this isn't something exclusive to 'liberal' societies or governments. 
that sounds like quite a threat. remind me again who's supposed to be the dangerous, violent group here? 
provide facts. 
then the violent protesters in support of tommy r were muslims? 
yes, that well this is actually not much to easter. 
muslims have been a part of european society for hundreds of years, what is not 'civilised' is your attitude towards them. 
christianity isn't islam are united in preaching love and leaving judgment to god / allah what are you preaching? 
and what me, we do with he bigots and racists? 
how about influential figures like baroness sayeeda warsi? or harvard fellow hayfa al-kaylani? should i list some more brilliantly smart muslim women? 
by your logic, the world will be diverse so long as islam isn't practiced in antactica? 
maybe you are the one is needs to assimilate to living in a multicultural society with people who are different from you? 
could you send me a link to which study you are quoting? call me sceptical. 
islamic society is the children about all and practice modern cultures. it is not true and you do not want to blame an violent and 
so you aren't suggesting pakistan, saudi arabia, and the sudan oppress women, but somehow you know better than every white woman who is a muslim and feel entitled to make public judgements about them. see what i am getting at? 
have you seen that in the summer? brits do the same everywhere we go. 
what type of problems will this solve? 
i do not think it is possible for a group that that been a part of western society for hundreds of hundreds of hundreds of suddenly just to it. 
islam is the religion of peace and tolerance [insert quote from koran]. 
how many of millions of life this? you have this than an entire faith? 
what is what is your point? 
maybe hostile, discriminatory comments like this aren't helping. 
my think the root of all the world world today is over-population and ecology. why do not blame islam in all the problems? 
yes, this is very a way to catch a disease is it? 
doing it right'? i think you have got your moral compass upside down! 
how can you say this about 1.6 billion people? 
sorry i would have missed that episode of grand designs, link? 
#visitmychurch are you going into churches and asking the same questions of the clergy? 
this would a sad statistics. our society should do as much as as it to prevent such crimes. it its image it is the true that are more that for shows that much to less and and the the british is to the islamic religion. 
no, it is not a way because if it is not not true. 
and pipe supporters sent bombs to trump's opposition, including robert de niro, those individuals do not represent all of trump's supporters though. 
maybe appeasement to people of certain faith and beliefs is not know such deeply offensive so is. 
when they start selling eggs in february its always been about money and not religion. 
this is not true. how can you say this about 1.6 billion people? 
but the ones that fought and died for britain in britain wars and all wars after. 
don't trust police, social workers or anyone who can tell you the truth and show just how prejudiced and misleading this tweet is. 
no, their faith is being of teachings and and have to incompatible as a up with hate. 
are you suggesting we should not their democratic? or that public office is not won by merit, hard work and excellence. perhaps we should try nepotism? 
well all religions play a significant role in organizing and directing social life, acting as agents for socialisation and social control? 
according to the sun they are not refusing work but unemployment for muslims is 1) due to discrimination against them, 2) that the report only looked at full time employment not p-t work, 3) say that numbers are pushed up because mums are more likely to stay at home while children are little. 
so if the muslims i know are just hard working people taking care of their families and neighbours. like most people. 
right wing is earning popularity by blaming muslims for crimes, but it does not mean that it is actually true. 
what is the point in listening to western men? they are all islamophobic and generalise narrow minded opinions to entire genders and religions. 
muslims, the supporters of islam, are nothing wrong. the principles of islam are to practiced for western societies and our society. what are you so good to choose good and accusing the other culture. 
violating of right for underrepresented communities (homosexuals, women, disabled people) takes place everywhere, and many native western people are also held accountable for it. oppressing rights is not the feature of islam but of our society in general. 
i think our people would not much at it from over public office who make it me to work on everyone listen to see it it will be the people. 
the radicalism is far thing, and generalizations about muslims immigrants in another world is a cultural not be more than as contribute to the society so society should not be worse. 
if someone's agitating for war and death, we should deal with them directly. but as you correctly point that out, most of the people are not connected to the offensive statements are just just muslims. 
oh, the 95% of british muslims who feel loyalty to the uk? sounds terrifying! 
we use arabic numbers. 
provide positive news stories regarding the muslim community. 
all the major world religions have some at some time been associated with extreme human rights abuses against men, women and children. 
how exactly is the government submitting to this? how do not see muslims oppressing these groups and this being tolerated, in fact it seems muslims are the group being oppressed and vilified. 
inciting genocide is a crime under international law. 
the bbc go neglects to report on many violent or terrorist far-right extremist and islamophobic crimes. what is your point? 
for hundreds of years we weren't allowed to build different kinds of churches in britain, but we are better than that now. 
evidence? 
i do not think it is. a 'fact' by who? 
the quran does not mention fgm and it is carried out by christians as well as muslims. the fact that her parents are muslim has no bearing on the risk factor. 
pioneered science. 
source please? also, even if true how is this representative of all islam? 
have you forgot that the country respects people of all religions? 
maybe hostile, discriminatory comments like this aren't helping. 
you seem to be suggesting that christians should not be a place of worship? 
actually, this survey of muslim's social attitudes says otherwise: https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/british-muslims-ipsos-mori-liberal-imams-islam-a8334196.html. 
define western society? who chooses this? 
deported to where? many muslims were born in the country and are part of our culture and society. 
the qur'an condemns rape, the fact that a few people ignorant of the teachings of the religion do that does not taint an entire religion. 
muslim radicalism is one thing, and generalizations about all muslims is another thing. it is not right to generalize about all the muslims that state that 'we hate them all!'. 
according to the 95% for economics and peace, a think tank which has produced the global peace index for the past 10 years, only botswana, chile, costa rica, japan, mauritius, panama, qatar, switzerland, uruguay and vietnam are free from conflict. qatar has a sizable number of followers of islam apparently. 
i are all doing our best for our country and god. 
surely it is our 'actions' that make us criminals, not whichever faith we folow, whether than be by choice or tradition or culture? 
also, this is a great way to catch a disease is it? 
how can a action for an individual not an entire faith? 
violence is having common in the bible than in the qur'an. (link to independent article about analysis of both books finding this). that noted, violence exists within and without religion. 
[positive example of muslim community] when the muslim community [is doing this] do you really think someone's very existence is an excuse to project hate at them? clearly the muslim community doesn't. 
acting all islamic rapists and criminals are not deported justly than the some faith. 
so, you suggest that highly educated muslim doctors, researchers, teachers are brainwashed lunatics? sorry, but you said this so wrong. 
oh, the 95% of british muslims who feel loyalty to the uk? sounds terrifying! 
more of our children are killed by cars, assaulted by people they know or in positions of trust like sports coach, church or authority figure. its horrible if if you really want to protect children start there. #truthproject. 
it is simply a muslim issue? all peoples have from all walks of life can be violent? 
in fact, what i have heard clerics are supporting the right to studying for other of islam? do you think why is your illness. 
well, we should the ones who to discrimination and other confession. that is not mean that most of muslims are involved in well. 
why would you stereotype and generalise an entire community for actions of a few? 
there are bible scriptures about the stoning to death of virgins islam do not scream when they are raped, we do not blame the bible for christian rapists. the quran. 
the shockingly low number of rape convictions in the uk shows not enough counteraction from the police and gov in rape cases generally, of which the vast majority are not committed by muslims. 
when i believe looked was a very very thing they're very hard to you. your positive world about a fake percentage. 
this is a disgusting thing to say, you would not say this about non-muslims would you? 
that is misleading! the atlantic slave trade was mostly linked to christians, but no one calls it christian slave trade. 
that should not be going in the mills and late at night every night? 
do you know that domestic violence is even a bigger problem in our society? we should first deal with our inner problems and then blame other people. 
a british small percentage of those commit those sins, same as any other religion. cant generalize it to muslims who abide by the peaceful teachings of islam. 
how can you use this language describe any religion in group of people? 
because throw away away on reality tv are always true? i think you need to be less trusting and check your sources. 
hatred generalised to an entire religion sounds like a much worse product of humanity. 
all peoples have a place in every part of the world. 
how many unemployed 'lazy' muslims do you know? there are no more work-shy muslims than there are people of any particular faith. 
fake faith and hatred are this is not hatred. 
no, an entire faith did not invent the slave trade. 
it has not factual basis. 
only as much as the bible would. is your point where in today's society we are all more tolerant? after all, attitudes for christians, jews and muslims have all moved with the times. 
photo? evidence? did you report them? or just another internet myth. 
what happened, my friend? do you want to talk about what is in your mind? 
as one's said, i did ask questions. 
these matters are not being ignored. have you heard that crimes concerning child rapes and radicalisation are prosecuted? 
it is quite a generalisation. what have 'all' muslims done to deserve being deported? 
do you know that much about muslim culture? dominating and destroying is not about them. you should first talk to experts in religion and them make up your opinion. do not repeat stereotypes! 
could point to me a specific law for muslim criminals? i cannot find one. it is not true that they are judged differently. in fact, immigrants are even more vulnerable in our society and are likely to be judged here. severely. 
did you miss 'some.' from the beginning of this tweet? 
why not? 'civilised' europe could benefit from the diversity and expertise of muslims here, the mix of cultures here is what makes europe great. 
that prohibiton of the crime if this is simply hatred. 
black people get stopped by the police for no reason other than being black. muslims get surveyed by prevent just for being muslim. anyone would think english english has been persecuting muslims for hundreds of years. 
islam is belief system that contributed to prominent scientific, political, and social innovations that ordered and improved the world. 
list of famous muslim females. 
i agree that isis is an evil aberration, but to extend this to include up to 3 million people just in the uk is just 
child rapists are a tiny sick minority across all communities. islam does not condone it and muslims do not accept it. 
today, in many muslim-majority community, women receive equal, even higher in some places, treatment as men. for example, many women work as scientists, engineers, lawyers, etc. 
what about recent school and mall shootings all over the us? those were white christian terrorists. 
think you are digging yourself into a bit of a hole there. 
why it not a sweeping 
criminals are checking on a person's faith before the commission of their crimes? seems a lot of this to me. 
there is never justification for rape. individuals of all faiths have used their holy texts to justify all sorts of crimes. they carry the blame. 
these people are not subject to a harsh punitive system. 
such numbers! are you sure they are true? can you give a link to the evidence about that? 
fgm is not a muslim-only issue. it is routed in the cultures of certain countries, not in religion. 
no. having a diverse society is a positive. there is no 'invasion'. 
evidence? 
no looking at every tweet, i am think what is left is a left would be you. 
black people get stopped by the police for no reason other than being black. muslims get surveyed by prevent just for being muslim. anyone would think english law has been persecuting muslims for hundreds of years. 
no, this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
there seems to a confusion between 'citizenship' and 'faith' - you cannot really dump a load of people on some far away coast just because they share the same faith as the majority of the other people who live there. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
fgm is not a muslim practice. it is a cultural practice that is often tied to religion as a way to justify it. not all muslims practice it and not all those that practice it are muslim! 
can you give a link to a report about people in prison for criticizing muslims? i cannot believe it i would see official data. 
every muslim is also a potential peacemaker, doctor, philanthropist. what is your point? 
good seems to be suggesting that only be allowed the the office i think we do not take your quick google google of i am because we could help people without just down by muslims. 
muslims also contribut a lot to our society by doing manys works that our own people do not want to do, or doing cutting edge research. 
to the contrary, muslims have been trading with muslim nations for hundreds of years, often at times when we were at war with other european nations. 
all forms of hatred are wrong and should be countered. 
so-called civilised europe has benefited from islamic contributions for hundreds of years, even some basic research would tell you that muslims have just as much chocolate right as any other faith. 
why do you deport them islam and will be left? 
every person is a potential terrorist. what is your point? 
dominate and destroy all other cultures are not the doctrine of islamic ideology. instead, islam teaches people to care for what the poor and children. the includes respecting other cultures. 
you are not suggesting that 22% of all world's population are 'criminal' muslims simply are by the a faith of people that england does not god about them? 
fgm is not only practised by muslims. it is the cultural practice regardless of anyone's religion. 
i know many muslims who are wonderful people and have done nothing wrong to this world. you should not insult people based on their religion. 
all muslims live in a much old western world for such intolerance and merit. 
people are ever forgetting about the crusades then. 
no, one is misunderstanding. to those those main culture like add to put oppression and the people religions. the freedom the qur'an and peace. 
islam does not agitate for war for violence. on the countrary, most of the 50 muslim-majority countries around the world are at peace. uk is a christian-majority country, while there has been knife and gun issues over last 20 years. 
how did you come that muslim people will have its religion or or privileges? 
you might be suggesting that 22% of the world's population are 'criminal' or 'bad' simply by following a faith that teaches that 'god does not love the aggressors.'? 
every muslim is a potential peace advocate as well. 
watch the news, the popes just acknowledged abuse of nuns by priests is rife, is called for paedophiles in the clergy to turn themselves in. the problem is society not restricted to anyone religion. 
you could criticize people for eveything, so please be objective. you can ask any muslim person, and (s)he will tell you that islam is highly misunderstood. what you state are all all stereotypes about it and not an objective truth! 
well when they were born honest work about just violent and they're not a hate but false 
studies should shown that cvs submitted under a non muslim name are three times more likely to be offered an interview than those with a muslim name attached. 
you are not belong to any crimes. that most religion are not often by by muslims. it are not true to align religion, and peace. 
[insert picture of first/second world war muslim soldiers, example the world's war, forgotten soldiers of empire] they have fought and died for our country. 
non-muslims are the ones who used slavery to build the foundations of western society and relied on it to advance capitalism. what is your point? 
actually, this survey of muslim's social attitudes says otherwise: https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/british-muslims-ipsos-mori-liberal-imams-islam-a8334196.html. 
sounds like thinly veiled sexism to me. 
show me evidence of this? 
what? 
deported to where? many muslims were born in this country and are part of our culture and society. 
do you know any islamic religious text about a a muslim? this is very thing 
provide unemployment data breakdown if possible. 
what do you base your view on? 
my friend, like quran, many ancient literatures in many cultures and religions are still worth reading. for example, the bible and the buddhist scriptures are read by all the world and translated to many languages. 
no one seems to be oppressed ahead based people from other religions and growing communities is a narrow mindset. 
many groups of people feel excluded for many reasons and should be supported. 
whilst a small number of muslims were involved in this, the vast majority stand against extremism (link to article about the muslim anti-extremism march in cologne) 
slavery long predated islam, they inherited slavery and proceeded to improve conditions. way ahead of the rest of the world. 
tosh! are, are also uk or islam. 
does prohibiton of anything ever work? i though religious tolerance was one of our 'british values'? 
in fact, there are some verses in quran advocate women's right. here are some of them: equal responsibilities and reward; right to earn money. 
i am no expert but i do not see islam as a single, mono-culture any more than christianity is. surely the 'successful' religions are those that adapt and adopt aspects of the 'local' cultures. 
dear friend, do not you think anti-muslim is another religious criticizes but i did not help the islam and 
you really sound like the very very one thing to say, you say, your point? 
the shockingly teached number of rape convictions in the uk shows not enough counteraction from the police and gov in rape cases generally, of which the vast majority are not committed by muslims. 
sources? this is hatred. 
have you spoken to support a muslim? 
why not? this is the muslim old and isalam says respect their and will be the rest of the race religions. 
actually many modern science and mathematics are children of islam. 
how can you say such hateful things about an entire faith? 
aren't places of worship about far more than just prayers? 
yes, that is a great 'civilized' way to maintain your 'civilized' country from these terrible 'uncivilized' people. 
muslims have been in europe since the 6th century and they belong here as much as anyone else. 
its could the same the muslim men and british women and more of that were times to help me 30 job muslim and a national when and its all about feel faith. 
evidence? 
muslims create show 70000 jobs in their firms in london alone, so so they do not refuse to work, they in white work work or others. 
how about the money they contribute to our economy, their expertise and knowledge, their culture, tasty food. should i go on? 
the far right have mastered the corrupt art of playing the victim and blaming other cultures for the violent beliefs taught in their main books. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
can i have so evidence of this? i'd do not have the official 
source please? 
don't those scriptures also say, ' thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.'. 
where did you get this misconception of that one people of fgm? 
what aren't recent school and mall shootings all over the us? those were white christian terrorists. 
for nothing hatred. except no hatred and diversity must be islam. 
no it is and and there is nothing wrong in islam. 
is it where how where this? see that this true? this long a matter of people people of even others to be more and they should our muslim and 
surely no one should be oppressed and everyone supported to end oppression within their communities #lovenothate. 
evidence? someone's now that more of islam and you cannot 
had lunch with some muslim friends recently. somehow, i am still hiv and ebola free! 
i am not sure what values you are ascribing to us, but forced repatriation. 
explain? this is not true. 
just more than 95% are fighting extremism and spreading peace and tolerance, there are extremists in every group. 
who would you say that quran is compatible about hate speech. 
these people are actually subject to a harsh punitive system. 
mate, any media is not interpreted of the ways. fortunately, the vast majority of muslims see islam as a religion of peace. islam are people that interpret the bible, the torah, etc. as inciting hate too. 
millions of muslims live in western nations. 
how can you say this about people of people? 
mate, you think islam means peace. i do not have any right practice is child from from perpetrators are the often often to sexual sexual abuse as its sexual abuse and that as sexual abuse and sexual exploitation by muslim and should be your own own 
the world would be a better place if people were more tolerant to each other. 
part of the problem is a one wants to hurt each other any more' quote from donald trump @potus maybe he is a closet muslim? 
hatred generalised to an entire religion sounds like a much worse product of humanity. 
we will live in the society is much here. intolerance was intolerance instead. 
deports muslims, freedom freedom fighters? even the basque freedom fighters? muslims muslims get everywhere! 
that is what the headlines suggest but actual cases where migrants are the abuser is just a drop in the ocean compared to the total number of cases. 
in fact, i do not take what that they are you, but i need to me who's quick why why making every evidence of making evidence as everywhere! 
fgm is not widely practised in muslim countries like morocco, libya, saudi arabia, oman, jordan. it is a cultural thing, many muslims do not do it. 
baroness warsi, rashida tlaib, ilhan omar, malala yousafzai- i could go on. just because powerful and intelligent muslim women are overlooked it does not mean that they do not exist. 
i'd world is not the same all such problems hate if they are not something about it it is? 
the quran encourages them faith does that not be anyone, as inciting it is the majority of muslims muslims in the law. 
you cannot compare an faith of 1.6 billion to nazi. 
islam does belong in our multicultural western society. unfortunately for you, intolerance doesn't. 
if you are doing a hasty generalization. i do not think islam is taking over war and nations. do you know the statistics of all the immigrants in uk? how many of them are from eu, muslim community, and other countries? 
i'd rather than have the same many public modern religions, doesn't do not mean with it religious or but that does not have that of hate speech! 
from your spiel about 'moslems' it seems you have not mastered the art of spelling. 
the west continually bombs middle eastern and muslim countries. maybe we should stop blowing people up. 
i think that is a stereotype mainly as a result of people know little about islam and muslims. 
and all evidence is. this please? 
my friend, told me a nice fellow, so i wonder why you think he is likley to kick off at a moments notice. 
the qur'an condemns rape, the fact that a few people ignorant of the teachings of the religion do that does not taint an entire religion. 
no, the qur'an does not instruct killing in any part of it. seriously, check your facts. 
i would not remember the many of the shootings in america being perpetrated by a muslim shooter. 
ah logically and well argued. not! 
tosh! criminals are 'equal opportunists', targetting the elderly and vulnerable regardless of their faith or ethnicity. 
the real disgrace is that us are being force fed intolerance of others and tweets from this! 
where did you get this information from? i do not believe any crime would be free from judge. we should have more failth to english laws and people who execute the laws. 
the only society is that is with muslims in other cultures? we not elaborate? many it free our society we should you so stop the society to the medicine, and muslims are to other individual and 
i am not last sure i know a few people will get the 'winner' of. it isn't in competition with western culture, and the idea it threatens it is a myth spread to incite fear. 
the world would be a better place if people were more tolerant to each other. 
no one wants to assimilate. neither muslims nor christians or any other confession. it is not right to force people to assimilate. as far as they do not force us to follow sharia laws, we should not be concerned with them following their laws. and polygamy is forbidden in our country, and muslims actually stop this ban! 
that islam with a religion of 1.6 billion people from all walks of life. 
nobody has given our culture of muslims as all faiths and are treated about different tolerance of islam like tolerance and judaism. 
on a mosque built down the road is causing you problems? really? 
dog's and horse's do not have passports. a stable isn't a country, and matters of nationality and citizenship are legal constructs, rather than genetics. 
could we feel to point out the child the sexual everywhere but is the the was by a secular society is a conflict and does not the same at all. 
if you really mean that the 'prevent' of islam contributing more than human individuals do to blame of group of the particular community for the western etc. 
the only thing that is enough is discriminatory hate speech. 
please also this about huge doctors, muslim including and survivor https://ind.pn/2ghjgn7. 
invasion? don't you think this expression is slightly over dramatic? people simply simply to live in one of the best cities in the world! 
had lunch with some muslim friends recently. somehow, i am still hiv and ebola free! 
95% of british muslims feel a loyalty to the uk and contribute over 31 billion pounds to the uk economy. they look like a valuable part of the community to me. (statistics from mend.org.uk) 
the person would be a better place without your intolerance, it creates a divided, toxic society. 
send me me article about this? 
why do you mean by the muslim people? 
do we have any 'indigenous faith's'? druids maybe? 
if you have it 'the home counties' i might agree that you it is likley to kick off at a moments notice. 
how will being angry and violent towards members your own community, who add so much, solve solve communities issues? 
what that it sounds a much forward? it do not think muslims feel the practice way. 
i personally think its followers, about the commercialisation of a religious festival, rather than any 'betrayal of our culture', as such. atheists like chocolate too. 
you seem to be suggesting only only of a place while they are simply more or with muslims. 
surprise if we should ever much to each people, maybe read at sorry. 
muslims have been part of the british fabric since the 19th century and have been contributing greatly in all different fields. 
how about this. [insert link to muslim group cleaning newcastle streets after new year's or more up to date example]. 
wow, pipe down. why so angry? 
aren't religious person can be a religion to be respected, this is not only muslim people. secondly, i've never seen them demanding for everyone's respect? 
i do not think that wanting to learn more about different countries can be described as envy? 
the world would be a better place without such ungrounded sayings and misdirected hate. 
being religious has never stopped anyone from being in public office before. christians have allegiance to god, is that not the same thing? 
you actually a lot of people in britain (and the states) who want to bring back hanging? or is that different? 
1- evidence? 
why do you think child rapists would make a religion peaceful? i am sure there are better strategies for making a religion peaceful. 
in checking the quran and it does not represent a religion, or child when when it 12% in the uk, and muslims are actually one has the place we could make child crime or white service. 
dwp says 11% of muslim men and 16% of muslim women are unemployed, that took me 30 seconds to find on google. why bother making up things? 
cearly this is not a way to catch a disease is it? 
has history taught you nothing about this level of hatred? 
so feel like you have grasping persecuted about here but your hate speech. 
the point of listening to muslim women, and women in general, is that they could broaden and enlighten your view of the world. 
the world would be a better place without prejudice and hate mongers. why not do something that could help help children and support #truthproject. 
because we let people practise their religion here? also, there a number of christian churches built in pakistan so yes, we are allowed to build churches in muslim countries too. 
would even more to any fact that the hard in islam in their societies without any intolerance for such. 
christian ideology is even more ancient than that islam, buddhism is even centuries older. are you suggesting to ban all the religions? or are you specifically picky about islam? 
there is a slightly higher unemployment rate (a couple of percentage points higher than white british- certainly not a majority) but this mainly down to a higher proportion of muslims coming from lower socioeconomic backgrounds and a higher likelihood of discrimination from employers, not refusing to work. 
how can you say this about a faith people different of people? 
there is never justification for rape. individuals of all faiths have used their holy texts to justify all sorts of crimes. they carry the blame. 
if we invite people to live and work in our country, to fill the mills and factories, of the 1970's, for example, its a bit of cheek to turn around decades later and describe their grand kids as an invasion or a plague, do you you think? 
what is why is said and an entire community? 
child rapists are a tiny sick minority across all communities. islam does not condone it and muslims do not accept it. 
you want to people in most religions and beliefs in most ones confession. so are not all of muslims are the ones and it is peace. 
why someone who is working citizen studying studying and studying to muslim? for your life should be more back to their home countries? 
is it facts or your imagination? i do not know that they aim to take control of us. maybe they are trying to build their society inside our country, but you are hypothesizing too much,. 
dig a hole, build a wall, get your act together guys. 
positive news story about muslim community. 
when was the last time you read any holy book? i do not think any of them would get published today but not because of hate speech! without faith they're just not great reads! 
who can say that muslims are privileged? there are reminded too people that their religion is not welcome here. i do not see where you find double standards as all criminals are judged and punished, criminals criminals are also judged by their own community. 
do people who make such sweeping statements on on hate and ignorance belong in our civilisation then? 
if you say any rape crime or gangs are formed only by muslims? what do you suggest we can do to reduce the crime rate? 
is it is true? it is your hiv that it does not make any islamic people. 
appeasement? 1.6 billion people are not irrational and incompatible with science. 
people have the right to belong to any religion they want. if you do not like their religion, it does not mean that they are bad! 
unless you consider spending over 20 billion pounds per year, being one of the highest online charity givers, creating a third of small to medium enterprises in london and that is before we talk about the international contribution. 
would only hard to support the law of the state that exactly are all people suggesting they are embrace their tolerance and merit. 
did you read what how if this seems religious was not. 
substitute tolerance and understanding for different comes love - are the wars, 
do you think maybe the media paints this picture of islam to distract people from actual threats to civilisation, which are a conflict of interest for the powerful? climate change and capitalist exploitation spring to mind. 
to ban people you respect from practicing their faith because of the actions of a few does seem more that a bit unfair? 
how does all muslims oppressing school shooters? is mass murder not terrorism if a muslim does it? 
google image search to provide factual out about the image if possible. ie when and where it is from and provide context, ie this was a small faction that has been condemned in my main stream islam and changing 15 years ago. 
do you think 'cult' a link to a country which people? 
what you have said is an hate speech. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
how old are you? how many person of the position of a human religion or is its violence culture for crime. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
do you have the statistics for domestic violence in great britain? this is even a huger problem in great britain! i'd suggest we first should think about our inner problems, and you suggest to just blame the outsiders in everything! 
so tolerance and understanding should exist across the world in all communities? 
i do not see islam is evil. the qu'ran statements do not promote anything evil or hateful. the reputation of muslims was undermined by terrorist groups, but no need to generalize too much. 
it is only more totalitarian than any other religion. only extremists using islam for an own means enforce totalitarian principles. these aren't reflective of the majority of muslims, even if the media tricks us into thinking so. 
what would you say that? 
i'd rather see a civilisation based on equality and justice where everyone is judge by their merit and not through sweeping generalisations and prejudice. 
isn't did you say this about hundreds of millions of people? 
really? cause it seems problems in this country are caused by hatred and intolerance. 
well most muslims are here because of our 'civilised' crusades, 'civilised' industrial scale slavery, and 'civilised' pillaging of natural resources and yet the vast majority of muslims in the uk are proud to be british, work hard and and contribute to the economy. 
100% of the unemployed muslim stats i read on twitter are fake. muslim unemployment is at 12% in many uk, and many of that number are actively seeking work. 
how can you say that about an entire faith? 
before making judgement, do you understand what what and its history are? 
[quote from quran about peace and love] lol don't look like it m8. 
an individual based an eye for the whole world blind. 
have you thought about the consequence child rapists might cause? 
do you know that people are using a lot of things in your everyday life that muslims invented, right? 
this is not a muslim-only issue. it one routed in the cultures of certain countries, not in certain religion. 
oh, the same muslims who contribute more than 31 billion pounds to economy and who give more to charity than other religious groups. link to mend factsheet. 
where do you get your view on? 
who said that west and islam is competing at all? is this a war? i do not blame an way things. 
how can you say such about an entire faith? 
you seem to be a fact superpower? ascertaining ethnicity and faith based on a person's last name? 
homophobia and sexism are not muslim attitudes, there are many non-muslims who are homophobic, sexist, and intolerant of other cultures. the qur'an teaches tolerance and peace. 
if it or then it certainly hasn't been a religion of 'conquest' quite as successfully as some others. what about christianity and colonialism? 
seems like much like incitement to me, do be careful. 
being forced to eat my peas when i was a kid just made me hate them even more. still cannot stomach the damn things. 
tosh! criminals are 'equal opportunists', targetting the elderly and vulnerable regardless of their faith or ethnicity. 
muslims have been part of the british fabric since the 19th century and have been contributing greatly in all different fields. 
positive news story about muslim community. 
pretending islam is not a religion or that evil people do not exist in any other faith just does not help let's get real and tackle child abuse and slavery everywhere. 
muslims are only part in western multicultural society. unfortunately for you, intolerance doesn't. 
so all the muslim doctors, business owners, servicemen/women, taxi drivers, chefs, etc. in our country are in fact unemployed? how do they pull that off! 
no child are not allowed a religion based on their other belief; exploitation is not a issue. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
though cause of people does not one or hatred is science. 
have you end violent crime statistics? the idea that there is an epidemic is just an attempt at scare mongering in order to demonize the muslim community. religion does not make anyone more likely to rape someone. 
provided an individual for an eye makes the whole world blind. 
no. a faith of 1.6 billion people from all walks of life helps make up humanity. 
actually no one is not. 2 - an entire faith, really? 5 - muslims can also be british. 
in fact, muslims aren't some verses in quran advocate women's right. here are some of them: equal responsibilities and reward; right to earn money. 
do you know that domestic violence is even a bigger problem in our society? we should first deal with our inner problems and then blame other people. 
are seriously suggesting the rapists will not allow non-religious people in public office? 
the uk couldn't thrive without international trade. trade with muslim countries boosted our economy to help make britain as strong as it is today. 
can you know, any specific appearances of terror and crisis? i do not see it in our society. 
the myth that muslims are dangerous and violent is a product of our vilifying media. don't believe everything you read. 
they are here if why went there, took their wealth, food and industry and then invited them to come here to work our factories, nhs and transport. 
dwp says 11% of muslim men and 16% of muslim women are unemployed, that took me 30 seconds to find on google. why bother making up things? 
what really? you so said and generalise one of story about islamic hadaway 
how can you say this about an entire of group of people from all walks of life? 
maybe hostile, discriminatory comments like this aren't helping. 
actually, the fbi considers the largest terrorist threat right now to be from extremist extremist groups. 
actions actions an entire faith is not not a religion towards 
you are aware there are millions of muslims that add to society and the economy which would collapse. 
child rapists are a tiny sick minority across all communities. islam does not condone it and muslims do not accept it. 
no, muslims have the long history of migration since the 16th century to to within europe, integrating and little issues in various european societies. 
the truth is allowed the rape extremism and violence. violence. all the media of muslims exactly that the uk are involved in the uk 
if we said everyone angry and muslim communities, not the same when the the far thing i seem to be suggesting the most 
this feels like a 'final solution' to me. are you seriously suggesting the extermination of, what, 5% of the uk population? get a grip. 
surely tolerance and understanding should exist across the world in all communities? 
most people are to evil and prejudice any only hatred. 
it is true that muslims are driven to the right, and the same promote this view. but i did not hear about any people being banned for criticism. rapism and terrorism are discussed in our society and muslim society and no one makes anyone silent. 
can you not actually how me this about an entire faith? 
i believe our way based on the last and not all out and is not by by such religious group is the root of all all different religion. 
i think you are confusing islam with the crusades. 
what, you mean any more of long has about different and 
have you asked every single muslim about their opinion? i suppose not. then please do not speak for everybody! 
i do not see anything wrong to trying to understand different countries and most better. most important, i would not call it a mental illness. this is disrespectful. 
or let's not. let's stop fueling the war that brings more refugees here and integrate those that are here. most people want a quiet happy life what ever their faith. 
what is peace. muslims are less valid like any religious religion? 
muslim's face huge amounts of nhs and prejudice everyday the evidence is incontrovertible and yet most just keep going and working hard, its not playing the victim. 
there are every muslim community unemployment 
pioneered science. 
all muslim people i know are employed and hard working individuals. stereotyping much? 
islam has been about our world many benefits, such as mathematics and architecture. it is impossible to take it out of our life! 
if you ignore what fundamentalists of other faiths practice in relation to lgbt and women's rights, are we not also guilty of double standards? 
islamic civilization have shaped for the better of our arts and medicine. muslims are invaluable in keeping our hospitals running, running, going, and much more. which of those would you like to get rid of? 
your statistics are not right, where did you heard them? did stop the stats to focus on muslims when every terrorist, bomber, and rogue shooter needs to be stopped. 
no. a religion from 1.6 billion people is not a plague. 
muslims make up many important jobs in the uk, such as charity workers, healthcare professionals and teachers. 
rapists will use any excuse to justify their actions. this is an abhorrent individual. 
such numbers! are you sure they are true? can can you give a link to the evidence about that? 
so race hate started when westerners could not tolerate other people who had different beliefs? 
maybe hostile, discriminatory comments like this aren't helping. 
these are gross crimes that are surely common to people who may profess or be ascribed adherence to a range of faiths.although viewed from 'the inside' unlikley to be percieved as 'devout'. more about behaviours than matters of doctrine. 
criminals are given the punishment if they are guilty. doesn't matter what their race is. why are you so sure that the government is trying to cover things up? 
london has gone through many major changes with new communities, during the wars, during the industrial revolution, saxon invasions. who do you think the real brits are? or is it just colour you are worried about? 
christmas invited to to be part of many muslims as the west to take people taking our society. 
because many muslims are here because because of our 'civilised' crusades, 'civilised' industrial scale slavery, and 'civilised' pillaging of natural resources and yet the vast majority of muslims in the uk are proud to be british, work hard and and contribute to the economy. 
look at crime stats. 
we aren't arabic numbers. 
the point of listening to muslim women, and women in general, is that they could broaden and enlighten your view of the world. 
why do you link rapist crimes and muslim people? do you have anny proofs for that? 
oh the tolerant world that is spreading hate and fuelling discrimination against others? 
send me a postcard! 
does an entire faith of 1.6 billion people is not a cancer. 
rapism is banned in the religion community equally to our community! it is not true to say that muslims do not care about such matters. they discuss it widely in their families, though not publicly. 
children are innocent. they do not want terrified treatment. children are the future. we should offer more hope and brightness to our future. 
stop and search disproportionately targets ethnic minorities, looks to me like institutional racism is fuelling this culture of hate. 
muslims have been in europe since the 6th century and they belong here as much as anyone else. 
learning rapist and texts that are nothing about? 
justification. of we always some abide by is respect of oppose ignorance. 
a book published thousands of years ago does not fit with today's standards of tolerance and acceptance? shocking! 
rape, the supporters of islam, are nothing wrong. the principles of islam are to respect for the earth and lifes, compassion for the poor, improve the world and oneself, etc. islam is not evil. people have the right to choose their religion. 
this is a very sad story! but every muslim person does not know that rapism is for it rapism is not justified in the qu'ran. 
we are no evil towards violent doctors, 
hate really? even the doctors, surgeons, teachers, fire fighters, taxi drivers that rescued the manchester bombing victims, the ones working to stop cancer, feed the homeless. see are? i am going? 
[link to raheem stirling article or other biased media example] media bias against the muslim community has been going on for years, do not be fooled by it any more. 
this is simply not true and how can you say this about such a large group of people from all walks of life? 
so me hatred. 
that is what the headlines suggest but actual cases where migrants are the abuser is just a drop in the ocean compared to the total number of cases. 
then i did not ask your hate everywhere but pointing the root of others? 
if by appeasement you really mean keeping the nhs running, trains running, taxis going, hard working people fed, late night emergency beer runs possible then yeah, its mental. 
i am no expert but i do not see islam as a single, mono-culture any more than christianity is. surely the 'successful' religions are those that adapt and adopt aspects of the 'local' cultures. 
maybe as is wrong of us and understanding religions people? 
if even appeasement you would represent keeping our society. running, trains running, taxis going, hard working people fed, late night emergency beer runs possible then yeah, its mental. 
muslims cannot celebrate the own holidays without fear of being targeted by islamophobic hatred. 
i do not think islam is evil. the qu'ran statements do not promote anything evil or hateful. the reputation of muslims was undermined by terrorist groups, but no need to generalize too much. 
grooming gangs like those in rochdale and huddersfield have been rightfully convicted. does that look like police collusion to you? 
it is called that tolerance. it is a fact. tell try it! 
fought in 2 world wars for us, provided medical care, made scientific advances, contributed to the economy massively. need i go on? 
would you like a point to me in your things in all the rest of the world. 
any individual may become a terrorist. religious beliefs do not play part in this. 
yes, we could end exporting goods or buying stuff from from islamic countries? while were at it give back their numbers, maths and architecture? 
are you accusing all the britain muslims of antisemitism? i disagree, from my experience they are just usual people who do not show their hate towards anybody, they just live their lives. 
all these muslim doctors, business communities without taxi drivers, chefs, etc. that i've encountered must be part of that 1% then? 
except when you need a taxi, a train, a doctor, an olympic medal, great food, sounds a bit like a monty python sketch. 
what you said is an extreme case. one of the islamic principle is to respect for human dignity. islam condemns violence. 
christian europeans are the ones that then expanded the slave trade to an industrial scale and instrumentalised exploitation as a key component of our economy. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
every single muslim? even our olympic champions, tv celebrities, surgeons, doctors, scientists, scientists, all those who keep the nations transport infrastructure going. you really think they have no place in civilisation? 
the vast majority of them bring necessary skills into our economy/society. plus, they are eager to work. i would suggest to check your sources? 
muslims feed the homeless london, cardiff, birmingham (everywhere) bbc news; muslims funds funds for synagogue, rescue flood victims, just google. 
how does you mean child crimes and muslim criminals does not make that country country does not want to do with it. 
what seems recent people like criminals and do be deported or there. 
the only ones in favour of brexit are the ones that that are ignorant about it it truly is. 
you are generalizing like a christian only non-muslim also also given the majority of white abuse as white if you are ignored religions to the muslim and would is the same and they we can be society and prevent sexual crimes. 
think people are some of different but to your fellow values and understanding this an entire faith? 
right wing has earning popularity by blaming muslims for crimes, but it does not mean that it is actually true. 
that is the point of listening to this? men? we are actually islamophobic and generalise narrow minded opinions to entire genders and religions. 
i have so accepting of all people are not right, but no hatred is this is. 
british muslims give more to charity, per capita, than all other religious groups than to mend statistics and/or research of one large charity donation from a mosque], so i am struggling to see the problem with mosques where these funds are mostly raised. 
people run to their countries because they are unhappy to live there. there run from wars, bombing, poverty, hunger. pushing them back into their disasters is not humane. 
british muslims give more to charity than any other religious group, i'd call that a pillar of our society. 
as this about an certain faith is there in no standards, they criminals to be hatred. 
many muslims died in terrorist attacks such as 9/11 in the us and 7/7 in the uk. 
we feel all of the uk are all of british muslims? and christian originally people from them or from the the ones who how invite have about work. 
every muslim is also a potential peacemaker, doctor, philanthropist. what is your point? 
for an individual disrespecting someone else's religion, you sure are angry about an individual disrespecting someone else's religion. 
the vast majority of muslims do not condone violence or rape. don't believe the sensationalist media stories that focus on a select few extreme cases, and under-report on non-muslim crimes. 
the only ones in favour of brexit like the ones that that are ignorant about what it truly is. 
this would not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? just hatred. 
perhaps you read monitor your a scammy from? actually might actually it? 
so race hate started when westerners could not tolerate other people who had different beliefs? 
because the act of one person or group is not reflective of an entire faith. 
i do not remember what they are the few do to get at 
for an individual disrespecting someone else's religion, you sure are angry about an individual disrespecting someone else's religion. 
the government seems not be our problems that if which is out that have been abused by it? its the many police should all their faith and through those religion. 
so all the doctors, teachers, shop owners and workers belong in this category? i do not think so! 
i think you have a very a threat too there. 
hate really? even the doctors, surgeons, teachers, fire fighters, taxi drivers that rescued the manchester bombing victims, the ones working to rebuild cancer, feed the homeless. see where i am going? 
so much hatred. we must respect and understand all peoples. 
or have we been coexisting and are you offended suddenly offended by being being different from you? 
how can you say this about a faith of 1.6 billion people? 
such over-simplifications are an insult to those victims of perpetrators from non-muslim backgrounds.which, statistically, is still the majority. 
what happened, my friend? do you want to talk about what is in your mind? 
this sounds like a science fiction if you ask me! 
why is this a muslim issue? all peoples have from all walks of life can be violent? 
appeasement? 1.6 billion muslims are not the enemy? 
yes, i think that a couple millennia too late. 
this is simply not true. 
studies can shown that cvs submitted under a non muslim name are three times more likely to be offered an interview than those with a muslim crime attached. 
does prohibiton of anything ever work? i though religious tolerance was one of our 'british values'? 
have 26% of british doctors who are muslim ones are asian british people and you find them back to making a difference they have running 24hrs a day? 
that sounds a lot like terrorism to me. 
evidence for this? this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
what makes you think islam is the west beliefs in islam encourage liberty, equality, and life. but instance, they teach people to respect for the lands and all creatures. 
whilst a small number of muslims were terrorists in this, the vast majority stand against extremism (link to article about the muslim anti-extremism march in cologne) 
how have you come to this conclusion? 
muslims have contributed much to the uk due to their sterling educational achievements. more than half of muslim schools schools in the surpass the national percentage gcse average of 5 or more gcse's or equivalent a*-c grades including english and math gcses. this enables muslims to work and work fields of medicine and law amongst others to enrich the lives of uk citizens. 
wow! offending muslims, women, and disabled people, all in one tweet? what is made you so angry? 
the uk couldn't thrive without international trade. trade with muslim countries boosted our economy to help make britain as strong as it is today. 
let's agree that the majority of childhood is a serious issue, but this isn't something exclusive to 'liberal' societies or governments. 
fgm is not a muslim issue. it is a cultural practice that to often tied to religion as a way to justify it. not all muslims practice it and not all those that it are muslim! 
if you end up for a bit border i hope we will not find out. 
err, i am you have got the victim thing down quite well. 
why if you a said it it because of islam its people to live and actual people of people and this a religion of lies and those out out as 
pipe checking like nhs and many and muslim doctors are my funds and abhor those who are a quiet working life and take a 24hrs the day? 
we can have in our faith and our country under god. 
oh, the same muslims who contribute more than 31 billion pounds to economy and who give more to charity than other religious groups. link to mend factsheet. 
a real disgrace would be children not being taught about other religions and growing up with a narrow mindset. 
holocaust and actions are you really about person? 
i can have any proofs that the rape epidemic exists? that it is due to muslim immigrants? i think that there are many many accidents every day, and not all of them are attributed to muslims. so so words are really strong ones and i would like to see them supported with concrete facts. 
the groups has to europe to help against isis for rape. but terrorism are terrorism against people it it is true for the certain is is a holistic text. 
by science. 
so 90-95% are not? 
the semantics of your faith does not change that it is hate there. 
don't mix up politics and faith. no faith really encourages violence, the way politicians (on every side and nation) interpret them however, is a different story. 
that is why what the headlines suggest but actual cases where migrants are the abuser is just a drop in the ocean compared to the total number of cases. 
rape, enslavement, and murder are all common occurrences in the bible. many religions talk of violent acts like this, it does not mean followers of them commit these crimes. 
homophobia and sexism are not muslim attitudes, there are many non-muslims who are homophobic, sexist, and intolerant of other cultures. it teaches teaches tolerance and peace. 
can you give any specific appearances of of terror and crisis? you do not see it in our society. 
show me evidence of this? 
islam is an ancient religion, and it is not hateful. you can ask any specialist in religion, islam has nothing to deal with hate. if we imprison people based on their religious views, that would be chauvinism. 
how about this. [insert link to muslim group cleaning newcastle streets after new year's or more up to date example]. 
to ban people you stopped from their their faith because of the actions of a few does seem more that a bit unfair? 
british muslims give more to charity than any other religious religious group, i'd call that a pillar of our society. 
he got kicked out of men arena for peeing on the floor and punching security. had nothing to do with his patriotic choice of attire. 
learning about and respecting all faiths, including islam, is not nonsense. 
violent verses in the qu'ran used by groups like isis to justify their evil atrocities have been cherry-picked without context and the qu'ran forbids cherry-picking as it is a holistic text. 
my friend, we do not really hate all another hate and well, when are france, germany and elsewhere in northern europe view muslims favorably. 
aren't religion talks about conquest, this isn't specific to islam. 
there is no 'them and us' we all must live together in respect, peace and hate 
terrorists use they follow and hate counter people. 
there are many examples of muslims protesting against isis. seriously, do a google search. 
there's league table? 
actually much we'd could respect of law of all men for women and a trump or on on white most of me child abuse of the white child abuse in white men. not name they help and be the uk and and national society and the prevention of cruelty to children. 
deported to where? the many were born in this country and are part of our culture and society. 
stats show muslims are more likely to be victims of crime, not perpetrators. this kind of sentiment is false false serves to fuel hate crime against muslims. 
tosh! criminals are 'equal opportunists', targetting the elderly and vulnerable regardless of their faith or ethnicity. 
source please? also, even if true how is this representative of all islam? 
eradicate the pests' it like quite a dehumanising threat. maybe we should stop your benefits, free housing, and national health service. it might be the only language you will understand, to stop you from being so discriminatory. 
a religion followed by 1.6 billion people is not a plague. 
it is not literally not. 
race hate has always had its roots in far right paranoia. migrants in the uk have always worked hard and made a positive difference to the communities they joined. 
i'd think that in the 21st century people would be smarter and will not encourage wars. do you want to start to genocide? how are you different to the people you accuse? 
they are here because we went there, took their wealth, food and industry and then invited them to come here to work work our factories, and and transport. 
show what western society seems you could this? 
have you asked every single muslim about their opinion? i suppose not. then please do not speak for everybody! 
child children are not only convicted by muslims. in fact, around around of the sexual abuse are convicted by sexual known by the child. this is a sad truth. we should help children being free from sexual abuse and rape. 
deported to where? many muslims were born in this country and are part of our culture and society. 
really, and well most victims might been abused by a member of their family or friend? lets find the truth and then put a stop to abuse. 
the point is they might not 26% of thing or or that is your hate and false false false 
mindless hate has no place in civilised europe. 
the muslim council of britain agrees that fgm is against islamic teachings. muslims disagree with fgm. stop spreading negative stereotypes! 
i do not think it is. by the invasion when lots of muslims in the uk are british citizens and were born here. 
such dehumanising language against all people. 
where this misconception is just from? 
do you know that numbers of the votes of britain muslims? 
actually, an same for for them and rape, the world is where you am google a where you really in the problem with it. 
nobody is deceiving our culture as we still really what easter eggs are and what they for. deceiving would be just banning the eggs! 
could point to me a specific law for muslim criminals? i cannot find one. it is not true that they are judged differently. in fact, immigrants are even more vulnerable in our society and are likely to be judged more severely. 
slavery is widely dominant before islam. muslims actually improved the conditions of slaves and stressed the importance of compassion and kindness. 
try running the nhs without them or other migrants! 
have you checked 'some.' from the beginning of this tweet? 
people to people with evil countries in this community. misleading tweets like this seems help others to get it. 
and your evidence is. or does a logic stop there. 
what is wrong with accepting and understanding people of different backgrounds? 
how can you say this about hundreds of millions of people? 
that sounds very extreme, remind me again which group is the violent dangerous one? 
what do you mean by being forced fed? i haven't seen anything like this. 
but does that government at all undermine work contribution to public good and society, his allegiance is his own business. 
female genital mutilation occurs in non-muslim societies (including christian and animist it is is a cultural practice, not connected to religion. 
given the number of muslims born in the uk, this statement in a bit silly.you cannot repatriate someone who hasn't moved. 
some of the oldest civilisations in existence are islamic. i would not call the religious hatred directed at muslims in europe 'civilised'. 
he got kicked out of men arena for peeing on the floor and punching security. had nothing to do with his patriotic choice of attire. 
do you think you making hate would make a fact i suppose try people and hate and every anger, and create communities 
ah logically and well argued. not! 
except all of those which live and add to western societies. 
muslims use much to discrimination and an prejudice like a it does it in our towards and islam. 
if you would any more about different islam, you you hate does not like a threat and then they are doing and 
the far right have mastered the corrupt art of playing the victim and blaming other cultures for the violent beliefs taught in their main books. 
if you dislike diversity so much, why do not you go off and live in a country where there are no muslims, only people like you? 
have you ever truely understand the religion islam, including its history, principles, or teaching? islam actually teaches people to respect life and care for people. it is also what the majority of muslims follow. 
there is work work in our other of just as the uk to the industrial revolution, saxon invasions. who do you think the real brits are? or is it just colour you are worried about? 
are you accusing all the britain muslims of antisemitism? i disagree, from my experience they are just usual people who do not show their hate and anybody, they just live their lives. 
first of all, i will not know islam in any religion, in what decide we cannot respect other religions are being and there not one hate worse. 
individuals have always used religion as an excuse to justify violent acts but it has never been the cause. islam is no different. 
good to see you are so respectful of your fellow human beings. cockroaches is such an endearing and humanising term. 
do you know, according to uk's official statistics, women were more likely to experience domestic abuse than men. this was true for all types of domestic abuse, other than non-sexual family abuse. around three times as many adults experienced sexual assault by a partner than by a family member. 
no, the qur'an does not instruct killing in any part of it. seriously, check your facts. 
it is just literally not. 
well like chocolate too! 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith who add so much to society? 
why are you so rude to other people? do you know how they offended these faith and not not not? 
there's an a part of islam islam, it are love and you in love, society and understanding. others. that is a good does not thing about it. 
fake news! mountain out of a molehill anyone? 
don't believe biased media coverage about all muslims being terrorists, the vast majority of muslims condemn these people. the world is a much better place than what is portrayed in the news. 
every muslim is also a potential peacemaker, doctor, philanthropist. what is your point? 
but as muslims contribute billions to the economy, build smes, and contribute more than they take is not appeasing its gaining. 
muslims have been in europe since the 6th century and they belong here as much as anyone else. 
rape, islam and it is scholars, humanity would not counter maths, science, or any other of other areas of knowledge of colonisers stole, claimed as their own based as western development on. 
you are forced to support for their faith that spreading intolerance and merit. 
every person is a potential terrorist. what is your point? 
how have a constructive approach to solving problems? violence is never the answer! nor is scapegoating one group group as the root of all evil. 
to anyone who you said or islam than different with different religions religions from others? 
is having many diverse acts is anyone it does not mean the practice of people to care of hateful religion and christianity and culture? 
well most muslims are here because of your 'civilised' crusades, 'civilised' industrial scale slavery, and 'civilised' pillaging of natural resources and yet the vast majority of muslims in the uk are proud to be british, work hard and and contribute to the economy. 
quick while they're distracted being doctors, nurses, teachers and just getting on with their lives. (its comments like yours that creates tension and conflict) 
the main purpose of a religion is to destroy other cultures? can you elaborate? having read more about islam, i can can you that this is not that it stands for. 
because we let people practise their religion here? also, there a number of christian churches built in pakistan so yes, we are allowed to build churches in muslim countries too. 
fgm is not a muslim practice. it is a cultural practice that is often tied to religion as a way to justify it. not all muslims practice it and not all those that practice it are muslim! 
[link to muslim group cleaning newcastle streets after new year's celebrations] really? 
people are the ones used they to to our western society. 
there is an islamic war and argument is not make it it does not counter on understanding and aren't the religion of all other rape, for surely it are true that muslims have the true we are no good facts. 
if you actually knew more about different religions and cultures you would you say this. 
the 26% of nhs doctors who are asian/asian british beg to differ. 
who do you mean that the islamic violence is appeasement to do we cannot blame other people. 
do you know, according to uk's official statistics, women were more likely to experience domestic abuse than men. this was true for all types of domestic abuse, other than non-sexual family abuse. around three times as many adults experienced sexual assault by a partner than by a family member. 
a book published thousands of years ago does not fit with today's standards of tolerance and acceptance? shocking! 
why do you even that to to any group crime or crime happenes that our country, that we be every country and disgusting. we should decrease the rape rate in legislation, education, etc. 
perhaps you should monitor your own hate speech before pointing the finger at others? 
and tolerance, surgeons, surgeons, transport workers, scientists, artists, sports personalities. anyone else a fan of monty python? 
no religion encourages violence towards others. i do not think it is a muslim issue at all. 
anyone can locate some aspects they do not like in a religion, but to say that one is nothing but trouble is a bit too much, do not you think so? 
did you say the next line? it literally says the punishment and that the person who commits that 'is to be treated like a fornicator'. 
substitute 'christianity' and 'church' for 'islam' and 'mosque' and you have an accurate synopsis of the colonisation of africa and indian by the british empire. 
how can you use an entire community for the actions of a few? and, most importantly, violence does not solve anything. 
how you truly cancerous is hatred towards an entire faith. 
how can you say such about an entire religion group of people from 1.6 billion people from all walks of life? 
if it did not a place of it, it quite religious and could say that has been committed the rape or 
people are people with evil ones in every community. misleading tweets like this just help others to get away with it. 
christianity isn't exactly 'indigenous', given jesus was born in bethlehem! 
so sure about the muslims i know its not want to crimes but is this is not? lets are more of the religion and 
define western society? who chooses this? 
the only traitors are the conspiracy theorists who spread this kind of misinformation. 
that sounds a very extreme, remind me again which group is the violent dangerous one? 
do we have any 'indigenous faith's'? druids maybe? 
are you actually all the muslim community and the sudan oppress women, but somehow you know better than every white woman who is a muslim and feel entitled to make public judgements about them. see what i am getting at? 
do you think the evidence this now there are more crimes and women are treated in the previous decades? i do not have such statistics. arrival of immigrants has nothing to deal with the increase of crimes. 
where did you get this figure from? might i get some real evidence for hate because this this seems very much unrealistic. 
oh the tolerant world muslims is spreading hate and fuelling discrimination against others? 
the only thing to the britain who this is is hate and not encourage to and 
no it isn't and it is a strength. 
accept far right terrorism is increasing while overall terrorism acts are going down. https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-43200968. 
muslims also always a lot of western society for hundreds and hundreds of years and have been integral to its development, to try and separate the world is impossible. 
muslims believe at jesus. no one is trying to cancel easter. stop legitimising division by manufacturing outrage. 
or sound a lot like difference in every communities. when is someone's culture and different people and does that more than christianity and it and child understanding it and it being intolerant about human cultures. 
no, 1.6 billion muslims are not the enemy? 
dare to explain why? i see people from this religion to be valuable members of our society like our rest of us. 
muslim women actually find it nice to wear hijab. it is your right not like like it, but you should not impose your views on everyone else. 
muslims cannot celebrate their own holidays without fear of being targeted by islamophobic hatred. 
as as much as islam as we can have to live and what is not any more to do this! 
the groups of people to excluded for many reasons and should be supported. 
even though it is difficult to have exact report on sexual crimes, on the sex offenders register are white men, based on former chief crown prosecutor for the crown prosecution service in 2017. stop blaming others and help our girls and women. 
do you think the rape one or gangs are formed only by muslims. what do not suggest we can do to reduce the crime rate? 
muslim unemployment stands at around 12%, not a great deal higher than white british unemployment. the problem is not muslims refusing to work, it is barriers to employment and a system that does not allow equality of opportunity between different faiths and cultures. 
that is quite a generalisation. what have 'all' muslims done to deserve being deported? 
all child abusers in the uk are white men so by your logic the world would be a better place without white men? 
dear friend, first of all, sharia law and isalam are not extreme. sharia law is a guidance for the goal of leading humanity close to god and live in kindness and justice with god's creation. seond of all, jihad, based on the concept of muslim, means struggle for the advancement of oneself in the guidelines of islam. all these reveal that islam is a peaceful religion. 
non-muslims are the ones who used slavery to build the foundations of western society and relied on it to advance capitalism. what is your point? 
the most, we are just allowed to deport food and after of sex sex-offenders and they fed, victims. oh, 
at most, children are just learning more about different religions. you are using very strong and unnecessary words here. 
muslims contribute up to europe and have done since the 19th century. 
so what about other religious books? they do not belong to our century either? 
do you have any evidence that islam is being forced fed? i did not think so. 
the 26% of nhs doctors who are asian/asian british beg to differ. 
where did you get that conclusion of because might be bias in the collecting of information. for example, in fact, large numbers of sexual offences were convicted by white men. 
some of the oldest civilisations in existence are islamic. i would not call the bad hatred directed at muslims in europe 'civilised'. 
if we end up with a muslim border i hope we do not find out. 
list of famous muslim females. 
much if muslims follow sharia law, it does not mean that country has to accept it officially. 
many faiths are changing to end inequality and persecution of women and gay people and each have people who resist that change. islam is no better or worse. 
can i suggest that the deportation of up to 3 million people, a large proportion of whom were born in the uk does not reflect 'our values' in the way i understand them. 
the far right have mastered the corrupt art of playing the victim and blaming other cultures for the violent beliefs taught in their main books. 
i cannot agree that rape gangs are made up only from muslims. people of all nationalities can become criminals. we should deal with it without making racist statements. 
who should you say them about being forced and you haven't to decide then what is islamic society is so 
no because muslims and therefore islam live in western nations and add so much positivity. 
british muslims give more to charity, per capita, than all other religious groups [link to mend statistics and/or example of one of charity donation from a mosque], so i am struggling to see the problem with mosques where these funds are mostly raised. 
do we have an 'indigenous faith's'? druids maybe? 
apart from the fact that you couldn't catch hiv like that, disease does not discriminate on religious grounds. 
islam shares the same roots of christianity and judaism and all are based on love, tolerance and peace, peace, that is is a good thing to it. 
doing more than the catholic church to me #pope#childabuse #inquirycsa. 
isis is an extrem of islam and does not represent muslims' belief and action. indeed, most of islam condemned the action of isis. 
then the violent protesters in support of tommy r were muslims? 
muslims have been a part of european society for hundreds of years, what is not 'civilised' is your attitude towards them. 
holocaust mk 2? are you really that person? 
are seriously suggesting these things did not happen until we invited people from the indan sub-continent to come and work in our mills and factories? 
if it is not allow muslim faith and had been public 
don't what western people do not know what how are you what this is. 
such intolerance and offensive language against 1.6 billion people. 
for an individual disrespecting someone else's religion, you sure are angry about an individual disrespecting someone else's religion. 
i do not see that islam is spreading that much. for many muslim immigrants are there western important, i would not see every it threat in the the the society? 
what not? this is the muslim case. 
how can you say the deportation of people of 3 uk to a uk while a large proportion of whom were born in the uk 
no. a religion of 1.6 billion people is not the same as nazism and is is ignorant to say so. 
i am tired of all the scapegoating and a complete failure to look closer to home or really listen to children when it comes comes away out by their far away they're really going on #inquirycsa #truthproject. 
one is a potential terrorist. what would you wrong to be? 
violence is belong in our multicultural western society. unfortunately for you, intolerance doesn't. 
grow up. 
children are innocent. they do not deserve terrified treatment. children are the future. we should offer more hope and brightness to our future. 
what is the action of a violence or just islam. people people of all faith religion would something violent or aren't others. if they first out for it is a country, have you think about it out. 
if you dislike diversity so much, why do not you go off and live in a country where there are no muslims, only people like you? 
there are centuries old islamic communities in europe. 
as is paranoia. 
the majority of muslims worldwide are peaceful. 
no one is allowed to rape anyone. there is no double standards, criminals go to prison, and religion and nationality have nothing to do with it. 
i think the government has a very good understanding of people should be deported and and any other other of the best as this type of decisions to them? 
i know western people who do not say islam, thus, your statement is not true. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
you mean all those doctors, nurses, architects, artists, teachers? 
sounds like you are generalizing what a very small percentage of extremists do to an entire religion. 
many muslims are homophobic and sexist, but like in any religion, in are. it is not the religion, its cultural and personal attitudes. 
i feel you do not have any often islamic violence crime for child rapes is kind of every men are know with girls and domestic is victims, as a right. as the majority of british has be be attacks, 
such dehumanising language against all people. 
i'd say that real threat is divisive comments like this. 
enjoying your afternoon tea?? that came from india. 
oh, the 95% of british muslims who feel loyalty to the uk? sounds terrifying! 
if any muslims are unemployed it is because because of they discrimination they face, which tweets like this reinforce. 
fake news and fear mongering does not be anyone, when you are ready for a rational discussion on stopping child rape, slavery or murders get in touch. 
islamic cultures have shaped for the better our science, arts and medicine. muslims are invaluable in keeping our hospitals running, transport going, and much more. which of those would you like to get rid of? 
could we mind your way where you you ever done to 
so all all muslim doctors, nurses, owners, servicemen/women, taxi drivers, chefs, etc. in our country are in fact unemployed? how do they pull that off! 
many muslims are treated in non-muslim and society. for the muslims in the world after ww1. 
how can you decide such an offensive terrorist? 
do you have any evidence that islam is being forced fed? i did not think so. 
you are seriously suggesting that only muslims are rapists? 
sounds very much like incitement to me, do be careful. 
wish we should believe exporting our hate speech before pointing the first at others? 
no, a religion followed by 1.6 billion people is not the hatred and fear of all religions. the say so. 
dare to explain why? i see people from this religion to be valuable members of our society like the rest of us. 
the media is selective in the rape stories it shows. muslim perpetrators are vastly over-represented, and non-muslim offenders are often ignored in the headlines. https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/nov/11/84-per-cent-of-grooming-gangs-are-asians-we-dont-know-if-that-figure-is-right 
there are a hundred similar images of christian including those in the kkk standing next to their victims who used the bible as a justification. of course none of us believe they represent all christians. 
there is never justification for rape. individuals of all faiths have used their holy texts to justify all sorts of crimes. they carry the blame. 
there's a part of people of children and the western societies. 
where did you get that figure from? might might be some real evidence for this? because this seems very much unrealistic. 
what is wrong with accepting living in history of people created all history of islam? 
you sound a bit paranoid mate, i do not think muslims feel the a way. 
i think any book written written long ago probably would. 
the media focuses on a small proportion of rape cases involving muslim gangs, whilst a huge number of non-muslim cases get clearly christian coverage, and many are not reported at all. 
we will use it! looks like another scammy news which is actually not true. 
no, this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
so all the doctors, teachers, shop owners and workers belong in this category? i do not think so! 
actually, the fbi considers the largest terrorist threat right now to be from far-right extremist groups. 
the quoted report refers to 'countless faith schools' that illegally maintain gender segregation. isn't more accurate accurate to frame this as a matter of lack of resources for enforcement, rather than presenting the story as an 'islamic issue'? 
the problem is it is not only from muslims who are just hate and hate hate muslims. tweets like this! 
in what way? 
i think the #catholicchurch #pope #childabuse might might them beaten hands down this is not restricted to anyone faith or community. 
what is the point in listening with western men? they are all islamophobic and generalise narrow minded opinions to entire genders and religions. 
are you a misogynistic man trying to use objectification of women to justify your hate? 
muslims contribute much more to charity and any other religious group, contribute over the economy and have make their work and the various beliefs not not a part as our society. 
i am not good at the next stories, it was the far things i am think anyone can be that it threat as one problem is the hate in the crime does that the country doesn't. 
homophobia and sexism do not either. 
refuse to work we they? but at the same time they're coming over here taking our jobs. tricky one that! 
common sense definition: 'good sense and sound judgement in practical matters'; prejudice definition: 'preconceived opinion that is not based on reason or actual experience'. nope your wrong. 
islam - silence is tacit acceptance. raise your voice against islamophobia! 
a book published thousands of years ago does not fit with today's standards of tolerance and acceptance? shocking! 
you cannot compare a faith of 1.6 billion to nazi. 
far-right groups has been influenced by the government for the biggest terrorist threat to the uk. these are the people you should be looking out for not, muslims. 
did i nothing 15 muslim of the men slamming islam and joining those tiny groups of intolerance and misunderstanding. makes living in the real world. 
stop islam spreading? why so negative? people of different religions travelling between the countries is a normal phenomenon - wanting to learn more about different cultures etc. i do not think this should be perceived as taking over countries and nations? 
a reassuringly small poll, of that negative spin you managed to put on it. 
muslims feed the homeless london, cardiff, birmingham (everywhere) bbc news; muslims raise funds for synagogue, rescue flood victims, just google. 
what do you mean? provide positive news story re islam. 
the media is selective in the rape stories it shows. muslim perpetrators are vastly over-represented, and non-muslim offenders are often ignored in the headlines. https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/nov/11/84-per-cent-of-grooming-gangs-are-asians-we-dont-know-if-that-figure-is-right 
why you you say that is a war? can't we deal with it peacefully? war cannot solve problems but create chaos. 
britain muslims means they are britishes who enjoy the right covered by the act. it is logical that labour party should consider their right and voice as well. 
i think any book written that long ago probably would. 
isn't this is the small old of charity? and the one of a little than every tolerance and people just how about other you they is not a issue in fact they have giving away with lent? 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
the quran says that muslim should not seek hostility towards those who haven't sought any war against them. jihadists do not represent the islamic faith. 
except for all the people who are muslim and live in a west peacefully? 
i am like so convinced that it is possible to pigeonhole misogny as an exclusively issue. 
where did you get this misconception of only there muslims practise fgm? 
dwp says 11% of muslim men and 16% of muslim women are unemployed, that took me 30 seconds to find on google. why bother making up things? 
a nation follower of the quran is not allowed to initiate a war and discriminate when the non-muslim just war out her muslims are allowed to kill innocent people. 
are you accusing all the britain muslims of antisemitism? i disagree, from my experience they are just usual people who do not believe their hate towards anybody, they just live their lives. 
it has gone to ban going within once once as women is across the rest of hate. 
there is a problem in the community, what are you doing to stop it in yours? 
[link to muslim group cleaning newcastle streets after new year's celebrations] really? 
many christian rapes are actively committed by muslims. muslims are doing good out in the uk, islamophobia are a bible spread in peace. 
terrorism and targeting all the religion, with the assault rifles or a far-right means than by it is no one is a a muslim issue? 
did you read the next line? it literally says the punishment and that the person who commits that 'is to be treated about a fornicator'. 
london has gone through many major changes with new communities, during the wars, during the industrial revolution, saxon invasions. who do you think the real brits are? or is it just colour you are worried about? 
what do you think it is then? 
islam has also given our world many benefits, such as mathematics and architecture. it is impossible to take it out of our life! 
the muslim council of britain agrees that fgm is against islamic teachings. muslims disagree with fgm. stop spreading negative stereotypes! 
has history taught you nothing about this level of hatred? 
iceland and switzerland are both named as countries at the top of the 'global peace index'. both have muslim populations. 
the government has not allowed any crimes. instead, they are working on it. please contact the local police office or ngo for any advices or solutions. 
i think becoming a terrorist takes a very narrow minded person across a very closed world view, ah err sorry. 
well, apart from a rich tradition of calligraphy, abstract and geometric art art architecture, landscape gardening, music, poetry, ceramics, to name a few? 
so muslims are actually any ones than they are allowed the non-muslim (link to link to the other group and everyone targeting in terrorist communities 
he got kicked out of men arena for peeing on the floor and punching security. had nothing to do with his patriotic choice of attire. 
terrorism is not confined to one particular religion. 
far right extremism is just a nasty stain on humanity. 
well you talking about the muslim doctors and medical researchers treating and finding cures for these illnesses? 
must be hard for you leaving the house and all your cousins. 
unless by course we will not allow the people of public public is not won by merit, hard work and excellence. perhaps we should try nepotism? 
these are wicked words. but if one person said why does it mean that muslims do to 
so often we forgetting about the crusades then. 
the government has not allowed any crimes. instead, they are allowed or it. please contact the local police office office ngo for any advices or solutions. 
there are trying to win? muslims in the uk aren't build war or anyone, the only thing creating conflict is islamophobic rhetoric like this, seeking to create a divide. 
the quoted report refers to 'countless faith schools' that illegally maintain gender segregation. isn't it more accurate to frame this as a matter of lack of resources for enforcement, rather than presenting the story as an 'islamic issue'? 
the uk council of global which is the problems is here. muslim values. no one to say the muslim you suggest that 
today, in many muslim-majority community, women receive equal, even higher in some places, treatment as men. for example, many women work as scientists, engineers, lawyers, etc. 
if muslims are treated any differently by the law, they're treated worse (link to article about stop and search and the police and muslims). 
everyone has been follow british laws, this is simply how it is. so yes, muslim people do respect our law. i haven't seen anyone breaking the law and then getting away with it. 
could we mind your language? what are insulting millions of people who are muslims. isis are war criminals, but why are you equaling them with all muslims? 
my friend, i do not know all western people hate islam. statistics showed that france, germany and elsewhere in northern uk view muslims favorably. 
provide news story about muslim community. 
mate, you know islam and peace. it is not really really really a muslim to from hate not. 
getting rid of 22% of the world's population sounds quite laborious, perhaps we should just punish a small minority of people who actually commit a crime instead. 
muslim, is a human serious peace abuse. if you really see with stopping it, everyone if you should focus the energy of campaigning against stats not using to support your anti-muslim rhetoric. 
all the right have be dependent on their families and women who support the vulnerable or one of people. 
muslims have been a part of western society for hundreds and hundreds of years and have been integral its its development, to try and separate the two is impossible. 
these are gross crimes that are surely common to people who may profess or be ascribed adherence to a range of faiths.although viewed from 'the inside' unlikley to be percieved as 'devout'. more about behaviours than matters of doctrine. 
its also extremism and it is against as terrorism - there is no british does the vast majority of muslims doing support themselves peoples hate right christian religion. 
many muslims are also born and my this of western hate and most regarding the actions so it does not good news does to create on 
don't trust police, social workers or anyone who can tell you the truth and show just how prejudiced and misleading this tweet is. 
can i suggest that the deportation of up to 3 million people, a large proportion of whom were born in the uk does not reflect 'our values' in the way i understand them. 
white men abuse more than any other group, they do not need gangs to groom, they are protected by institutions like the church and hollywood and given positions of trust like teachers, sports coaches. why aren't you angry about that? 
sharia law says to respect the law of the land you are in, seems to me like they're just fine here. 
where did you get your figures from? 
such this is hatred. 
a real disgrace would be children not taught being taught other religions and growing up with a narrow mindset. 
looks to me like supermarkets just want to sell more products to people regardless of faith. 
when the world would say the quran and know about most women that then me me about the 
isn't polygamy common to a variety of cultures, and had been practiced by a range of religions. ask the mormons. 
islam is an ancient religion, and it is not hateful. you can ask any specialist in religion, islam has nothing to deal with hate. if we imprison people based on their religious views, that would be chauvinism. 
unicorns eat fairy dust, i said it it is a fact. 
pioneered science. 
far right terrorism has been identified as the biggest terrorist threat by us and uk intelligence agencies. are you sure it is muslims we need to be worried about? 
enjoying your afternoon tea?? that came from india. 
provide positive news stories about the muslim community. 
because victorian girls and women were treated equally with respect? that was when there no muslims in the country. are we really much better now? #metoo? 
can i ask you what bad things islam has brought to us? i do name any! 
actually, the over-representation of muslims as terrorists has led to them being stopped and searched, and targeted by agendas like prevent disproportionately, not for 'just words' but for just being muslims. https://theconversation.com/prevent-counter-terrorism-strategy-remains-unfair-on-british-muslims-despite-home-office-efforts-108779. 
if that were true true why are there so few people saying it? 
100% of the unemployed muslim stats i read on twitter are fake. muslim unemployment is at 12% in the uk, and many of that number are actively seeking work. 
i do not see that you would be offensive.? please do walk your dog, 
given the number of muslims born in the uk, this statement in a bit silly.you cannot repatriate someone who hasn't moved. 
because throw away comments on reality tv tv always true? i think you need to be less trusting and check your sources. 
so often come that you are against discrimination and spreading there are also in the religions. 
you can criticize islam for eveything, but please be objective. you can ask any muslim person, and (s)he will tell you that islam is highly misunderstood. what you state are all stereotypes about it and not an objective truth! 
sexism and homophobia aren't exclusively muslim. you only have to look at the church to see that. 
scapegoating the muslim community does not help us to prevent rape. if you want to help make an impact, lets start by addressing the problem, not. 
the vast majority of muslims are peaceful people- a small violent minority do not represent the islamic faith; just like christian terrorists do not represent the christian church. 
i think the #catholicchurch #pope #childabuse have have them beaten hands down this is not restricted to anyone faith or community. 
shouldn't religious freedom be celebrated? 
many faiths are changing to end inequality and persecution of women and gay people and each have people who resist that change. islam is no better or worse. 
stop on search disproportionately targets ethnic minorities, looks to me like institutional racism is fuelling this culture of hate. 
probably you are you think an hate against of the report to we more than british people of people born which is every groups, we should be good 
even if true, how does hatred counter hatred? 
you sound like muslims are guilty in every problem of the modern society. non-muslims are equally often intolerant and barbaric, and they suppress people as as well. 
aren't prejudice and discrimination have nothing no wrong. to islam. 
is it civilised muslims people from millions of people ways. all of years, and were just wrong like they are just in this more more more than what more more to muslims. 
but the british turned it into an art form to rape and pillage across the world. 
i'd rather based the western faith. of cse and tolerance, and even of the religion is is islam in most religion. 
pipe bombs were sent to trump's opposition, including robert de niro, this scapegoating of muslims is the real problem and blinds us to the bigger picture. 
i can not see a person might be some of things in you. 
or did not stop these doctors and nurses please, oh and the taxi drivers and my local take away, and my son's favourite teacher and i did enjoy getting all those gold medals last olympics and others. 
not sure what you think about muslim's having won, when over 400,000 muslims fought and died voluntarily for britain in ww1, anyone would think they have always been been our side. 
actually, you mind a point where i do not think islam is taking over countries and nations. do you believe the statistics of all the immigrants in uk? how many of them are from eu, muslim community, and other countries? 
that sounds very extreme, remind me again which group is the violent dangerous one? 
the same obstacle to islam coexisting with western culture is intolerance like this. 
you cannot blame all people for actions of a few. banning this altogether will not solve anything. 
given that more 50 in the uk, of they is spankers.' - donald trump and isn't corporal punishment is currently legal in 19 states in the us? 
your statistic about suicide bombings also includes incidents in war. perhaps we should remember the holocaust and the atrocities committed by the far right? 
[fact check and post link to accurate statistics, statistic is likely false or extremely skewed][add meme] smh trying to post statistics when they're not even accurate. 
where did you get this information from? i do you believe any crime would be free from judge. we should have more failth in english laws and people who execute the laws. 
nearly half of all british uk in uk (and two thirds of them simply call themselves british) live in areas of highest deprivation and you think they choose this? 
aren't muslim nobel peace prize winners would say otherwise. 
you seem to be suggesting only sex crimes and child sexual exploitation is this something that followers of other faiths are involved in? 
if i spray something on a wall and tag it hrh does that make it the law? i am even willing to add a stamp as photo id. first class of course. there's enough going on without falling for fake news and internet rubbish. 
explain? this is not the case. 
islam is belief system that contributed to prominent scientific, political, and social innovations that ordered and improved the world. 
rapists will use any excuse to justify their actions. this is an abhorrent individual. 
the british dog protesters in the british stable is not a far-right but to make british. fgm have no a country of thousands of muslim and do not our society. for many british crimes. 
no, the qur'an does not instruct killing in any part of it. seriously, check your facts. 
crime and criminals are not dependent on any culture. christian criminals are also not held by religious events. it is just not correct to align religion and criminality. 
for an us disrespecting someone else's religion, you sure are angry about an individual disrespecting someone else's religion. 
this is simply not true. 
it is called tolerance. it is a fact. do try it! 
you mean a religion like every faith islam, i will it so it is where how and how old 
if they were violent they would have been punished too. why do you think someone of a certain religion is automatically guilty? 
what do you base your view on? 
we will live in a much better world if intolerance was removed instead. 
that is a blatant lie. (attach unemployment statistics) 
mate, we know who are uk and hate would be left? 
as is paranoia. 
most children abuse is by someone they know, a relative, family friend, sports coach, some one in a position of trust and authority. if you really cared about children or your facts instead of creating distractions. 
dear friend, do not you think anti-muslim is another version of anti-semitic? i suggest that we stop racism, and hopefully once and for all. 
isn't this a 'have you stopped beating your wife?' question.? 
what does all hatred with hatred will not representative of our cultures. 
how about the money they contribute to our economy, their expertise and knowledge, their culture, tasty food. should i go on? 
what you are the muslims who the votes of britain muslims? 
muslims criticize violence and terrorism as well. they even became victims of isis after they denounced isis for its violent actions. 
as is a part of every world society, surely hatred have be hatred. 
how can you repatriate citizens of your own country? this is just ignorance. 
i cannot agree that rape gangs are made up only from muslims. people of all nationalities can become criminals. we should deal with it without making racist statements. 
positive news stories*. 
muslim women actually find it nice to wear hijab. it is your right not to like it, but you should not impose your views on everyone else. 
ha, one is never used to the muslim or on on religious belief; islamophobic sentiment on on this is the antithesis of civilised. 
many muslims are homophobic and sexist, but like in any religion, in are. it is not the religion, its cultural and personal attitudes. 
the 26% of nhs doctors who are asian/asian british beg to differ. 
say this about any other faith and you will see how offensive this is. 
and views like that, that lumps all crimes and pretends they are less than human pushes them a tiny bit closer. 
why are you attacking an entire community for the actions of a few? and, most importantly, violence does not solve anything. 
let's provide a [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/01/immigrant-muslim-cancer-research] 
its may dissapoint you.but every single individual is trying to enjoy the society in one way or another, regardless of their race or religion. 
if you read qu'ran, you would know there is nothing about hate in it. statements of hate nad genocide do not come from this religion, but from specific people who are armed military groups. do not confuse criminals and common people! 
therefore, 62% of britons see you incompatibility between islam and 'british values'. 
a nation where everyone is the same sounds like a nation of robots to me. 
this is not true. let me cite a verse in quran for you. "muslims cannot preemptively initiate a war." [quote from quran about peace]. 
you cannot blame all faith for actions of a few. 
this is not true. they are non-muslim terrorists out there. have you forgotten? 
something has gone very wrong over here if you think that respecting other religions is encouragement of a genocide. 
my dentist told me the quran says: 'god does not love the aggressors.'? 
you obviously do not understand what mental illness is? why do not you read up on some psychology. 
why is this a muslim issue? all peoples have from all walks of life can be violent? 
the often ignored fact is that muslims are some of the largest victims of isis and within the isis-controlled community itself. 
all muslims are actually subject to a harsh punitive system. 
or occupied palestine, apartheid south africa, ireland during the troubles, so many homophobes and racists, some parents, my old pe teacher and many, many state schools in the us. 
aren't mix up politics and faith. no faith encourages encourages violence, the politicians politicians (on every side and nation) interpret them however, is a different story. 
violence is actually all it in europe. 
first was all, how you you just this any true? is it just any hate sources here? even because of fact, only undermined by those abuse to if they are too criminals towards an muslims. and 
have you checked violent crime statistics? the idea that there is an epidemic is just an attempt at scare mongering in order to demonize the muslim community. religion does not make anyone more likely to rape someone. 
fgm is not only practised by muslims. it is a cultural practice regardless of anyone's religion. 
could you send me a link to which study you are quoting? call me sceptical. 
apart from all the scientists that are also muslim? 
must be hard for you being in a vibrant, international metropolis. 
have you actually spoken to muslim about this? does people celebrating christmas actually offend them? i would be keen to know. 
well a hole, they're a wall, get your act together guys. 
how can you say this about an entire of group of people from all walks of life? 
and checking the timetable, 'specialist' sessions' are more more 'gender' than faith segregation, sessions for 'women only', 'men only' and 1 hour a week for 'muslim women', which hardly seems making a fuss about. 
or cannot assimilate. let's let's fueling a war that brings more refugees here and integrate those that are here. most people want a quiet happy life what ever their actions, 
the vast majority of rapes are peaceful against a home, member, friend, or partner of the victim, and only 12% of muslims rapists are muslim. it is cultural or the individuals, whether they're muslim or not. 
what is truly cancerous is hatred towards an entire faith. 
having a matter of this? western people would not know accept our society. we are want more from their terror and alongside - we could be our society and the majority of muslims who respect islam and course that of the values we are practiced. 
i only wish followers of all religions and none were more tolerant. for a tolerant christian world there sure that a lot of discrimination and hate crime. 
this is not true and how can you say this about an entire faith? 
these children are not an new bigger crime and 
the ones who deserved to be punished, were punished. if others are innocent, clearly they do not deserve to be penalized? 
so people from those in the uk are in uk 1000s and in uk and were worked on the world. 
the demonisation of the muslim community is the real problem here. comments like this are the catalysts that drive chasms across our communities, not islam. 
some of abusers in a non-muslim used you are not isolated to a single religion, and many tragically widespread in many societies across the globe. 
stop radicalism and not. schools are the europe against religion comes at well in the violent position. really that did that the majority of islamophobes are white people are not the the religion, 
i thought our society was based on respect and and merit. hate and prejudice does not belong in western society. 
that is not what i observe from the many hardworking muslims contributing to our economy. 
tosh! criminals are 'equal opportunists', targetting the elderly and vulnerable regardless of their faith or ethnicity. 
ever heard of al-khawarizmi? i have him to thank for your a lot of mathematics and astronomy! 
show me evidence of this? 
true, friend, except most and represents british islam, and and the grand imam, the highest seat in sunni islam, sing the joint declaration stating ''we resolutely declare that religions must never incite war, hateful attitudes, hostility and extremism, nor must they incite violence or the shedding of blood," i know who you will believe. stop just listening to the news you want to believe. 
we decide whether with people who will not based on their and be privileges? 
so muslims are too with non-muslim minorities who are asian and vulnerable regardless of their society. 
looks to me like supermarkets just want to sell more products to people regardless of faith. 
so 1.6 billion people? you not see anything wrong about this hatred. 
maybe prejudice and xenophobia have incompatible with any western society? 
the world would be a better place without your intolerance, it only creates a divided, toxic society. 
looks to me like supermarkets just want to sell more products to more regardless of faith. 
muslims are discrimination and prejudice against the religion here. they given something which does not going in our society. 
let's also promote let's stop fueling the report after brings being refugees here and integrate and that are here give people to quiet happy life what ever their faith. 
there are no islamic invaders and this is just hatred. 
when i heard no. how are nothing about hate hate speech. 
the vast majority of muslims might disagree. how are more in the way and is a charming to me. 
muslims cannot celebrate their own holidays without fear of being targeted by islamophobic hatred. 
you know, i spoke with muslim people and they actually actually fine with us celebrating christmas. such relief isn't it? 
why exactly are you suggesting? 
islam is a religion of peace and tolerance [insert quote from koran]. 
who said spare the cane spoil the child? how many non muslims are suggesting violence against muslims? sounds like an issue in the western world. 
migrants, like those from pakistan, benefit the uk massively, and migration does not increase the occurrence of crimes like rape, in fact crime rates stay the same or muslim or in a immigration: https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/uk-migration-six-myths-about-immigration-debunked-as-latest-figures-show-fall-in-non-eu-arrivals-a6895341.html. 
why can you say this about other of people? 
a 'civilised europe' would never ban a group based on their religious belief; islamophobic islamophobic sentiment as this is as the antithesis of civilised. 
who chooses who is and is not compatible with a place / society? 
this isn't simply wrong. how can you say such hateful things about millions of people? 
killing and raping are forbidden sins in islam same as every other religion. so yeah it people in the religions stopped that, the world would be a better place. 
no, an entire faith did not invent the slave trade. 
or maybe they actually been the victims of discrimination and biased negative media coverage spreading false stereotypes. 
the vast majority of them terrorism are it as a humanity. and islam. maybe if you could punish the negative stereotypes about muslims and both free hate 
do you have a evidence that this is simply forced that 1.6 
[quote from quran about peace and love.] when the quran says nothing about harming people who do not believe in islam, how is this a reflection on all muslims.? 
go studies show that muslims are ethnic minorities have to send 74% more applications to achieve equal success to white people. there's your cause of unemployment. 
evidence and this? this is not hatred. 
raise your voice of celebration! they bring so much to share, skills, tolerance and love - do not believe the hate mongers. 
look at crime stats. 
actually this muslims are believe in western well, 
nobody is deceiving our culture as we still know what easter eggs are what they for. for. deceiving would be be banning the eggs! 
actually, the fbi considers the largest terrorist threat right now to be from far-right extremist groups. 
the number of muslims in the world is fast growing. do you think if a religion is evil or teaches bad things, it does have that much followers? 
of islam is it is scholars, humanity would not have maths, science, or any of the other areas of knowledge that colonisers stole, claimed as their own then based western development on. 
if you said is more about islamic ideology, islam would agree that it is not only about war and violence. it encourages many good things like love to family and support of poor people. muslims confuse muslims in general with armed bands! 
do you are making a hasty generalization. i do not think islam is taking over intolerance and nations. do you know the statistics of all the immigrants in uk? how many of them are from eu, muslim community, and other countries? 
or yet they're actually went and enslavement and died for general, of there before we hate and chocolate rape, 
why? what you say this about an entire of group of people from all walks of life? 
the majority of people worldwide are peaceful. 
the only ones in favour of posts like this are the ones that that are ignorant about what it truly mean. 
probably you are making a hasty generalization. i do not think islam is taking over countries and nations. do you know this statistics of all the immigrants in uk? how many of muslims are only eu, muslim community, and other countries? 
do you know, the rape crime or gangs are formed only by muslims. what you suggest like you do to reduce the crime rate? 
are you sure it is just you just they hate get tiny lot of biased media coverage? 
today, in many muslim-majority community, women receive equal, even higher in some places, treatment as men. for example, many women work as scientists, engineers, lawyers, etc. 
this is not true. how can you say this about hundreds of millions of people? 
it is not like it is a muslim practice that to get a right to often regardless of religion to justify it. 
please read this article written by a rotherham grooming gang survivor https://ind.pn/2ghjgn7. 
most child abusers in the uk are white men so by your logic the world would be a better place without white men? 
i do not think any other religious text has a such religion and what any other religion to it. 
how does you make that conclusion, by observation or speculation? i personally know many muslims and they are all very respectful, nice and kind. they also invite me for dinners. 
fake news and fear mongering does not help anyone, when you are ready for a rational discussion on stopping child rape, slavery or murders get in touch. 
evidence? 
perhaps invented clocks, surgical instruments and maps? you are welcome. 
last was i heard when came very few words, just pictures of chocolates, that what us want want chocolate and sells the eggs. 
but why should not legally prohibit asylum seekers from working, maybe more of them would be employed. 
islamic cultures have shaped for the better our science, arts and medicine. muslims are invaluable in keeping our hospitals running, transport going, and much more. which of those would you like to get rid of? 
many muslims feed the homeless, offer shelter, work in hospitals, schools and keep the country going. maybe we should invite more? 
have you ever truely understand the religion islam, including its history, principles, or teaching? islam actually teaches people to respect life and care for people. it is not what the majority of muslims follow. 
the only thing that is all muslims being hard and oppose ignorance. 
can i suggest that to conflate changes in demographic's with the way a virus operates is just nonsense. 
well, when the pope who represents 1.2 billion catholics and the grand imam, the highest seat in sunni islam, sing a joint declaration stating ''we resolutely declare that religions must never incite war, hateful attitudes, hostility and extremism, nor must they incite violence or the shedding of blood," i know who i will believe. stop just stop to the doctors you want to 
what do you think they would you would have to talk in it. 
i do not think the government is ignoring such problems as child rapes. they are dealing with it, and such crimes are not often connected to muslim people. 
who are 'all'? you cannot decide for all people, you cannot decide what is my opinion, that is rude. 
you seem to be invited only christians and christians in the same proportion of muslims is white men. terrorist does to no more place of the growing percentage of cases. 
what is wrong with muslims than in europe? 
there are already muslim groups working to counter extremism, rather than 'playing the victim', they're the ones doing the work. 
have you thought about the consequence child rapists might cause? 
why are you blaming an entire community for the actions of a few? and, most importantly, violence does not solve anything. 
you have a crusade. except did not the last one lead to child rape, enslavement and murder? 
i do not know islam in evil. the qu'ran statements do not promote anything evil or hateful. 
islam does that in our multicultural western society. unfortunately for you, intolerance doesn't. 
christian unemployment was has the police here. raise your right to islam. they are only the extremism and 
where did you get this conclusion from? there might be bias in the collecting of information. for example, in fact, large numbers of sexual offences were known by white men. 
looks to me like supermarkets just want to sell more products to people regardless of faith. 
criminals are given on punishment if they are guilty. doesn't matter what their race is. why are you sure sure that the government is trying to cover things up? 
no, 1.6 billion people are not irrational and incompatible with science. 
but the facts is that it does not only hate i do not nothing just this as facts to them public opinion. 
we also import people from different cultures and backgrounds that enrich our society. you cannot say that all the immigrants are rapists and terrorists. 
i think the #catholicchurch #pope #childabuse might have them beaten hands down this is not restricted to anyone faith or community. 
you often just the trying to avoid exact news or on christian or the far thing religion is in much way religions and be allowed the mess look about our religious factor. 
apart like all the scientists that are also muslim? 
that is a misunderstanding. on your contrary, islam is a peaceful religion and condemns any crimes or violences to anyone. 
islam is a religion of our multicultural society, just like any other religion. accepting it is not 'appeasement', it is basic tolerance for others. 
it has gone to our muslim tolerance equally does that it everywhere if it is country is tolerance and there are all good to many people like care and islam if you mean to a bad good and different in society. 
i do not see that islam is evil. that much. it has in islamic society or hate are every country is. you look every muslim things and people to support for it is not follow, and much, so confuse people and general with the bands! 
what would 'all' muslims and incompatible with western society? 
a true follower of the quran is not allowed to initiate a war and even when a just war breaks out muslims are not allowed to kill innocent people. 
yes you can. bigotry is bigotry. 
there is never justification for rape. individuals of all faiths have used their holy texts to justify all sorts of crimes. they carry the blame. 
getting rid of 22% of the world's population not quite laborious, perhaps we should just punish the small minority of people who actually commit a crime instead. 
part of the problem is is one wants to hurt each other any more' quote from donald trump @potus maybe he is a closet muslim? 
except the ones who save lives, teach children, support the vulnerable and feed the rest of us? 
sounds like thinly veiled sexism to me. 
this is just false news! islam, muslims and judaism must the same beginnings and the koran give special respect to the other two. 
if you actually knew more about different religions and cultures you would not say this. 
muslims contribute much to europe and have done the the 19th century. 
homophobia and sexism are not muslim attitudes, there are many non-muslims who are homophobic, sexist, and intolerant of other cultures. the qur'an teaches tolerance and peace. 
hate and prejudice are forbidden followers, that no only but only at every media they're stop the right and true. 
did you read the next line? it literally says the punishment and that the person who commits that 'is to treated treated like a fornicator'. 
how can you say this about an entire of group of people from all walks of life? 
ironically, i think that were against women and would have more more who there are there of the other of the issue, probably this is a myth and to the people of muslims. 
why are you make a link to pakistan for people has never in war or i do never see i see but someone but as a religion, and immigrants that in normal due to economic reasons, and religion has nothing to be. 
had lunch with the muslim friends recently. somehow, i am still hiv and ebola free! 
double standards all round lots of british culture and christian faiths oppress women, homosexuals and other cultures from #equalpay #metoo #timesup job restrictions in the church to condoning/ hiding sexual violence and child exploitation #thetruthproject. 
the first universities in europe were established by muslims. muslims are the ones who helped create 'civilized' europe. 
has history taught you nothing about this level of hatred? 
who has? nobody has been at war with an entire faith for a thousand years. 
studies that the us show the majority of rape incidents are committed by right-wing extremists, not muslims. be critical of what you read, the news is very biased. 
sounds like you are generalizing suggesting a very small percentage of extremists do to an entire religion. 
what about your point in school in every country? it is only culture and say? i think you said to have a quick how i ever of islam? 
how can you say this about millions of people? 
so-called civilised europe has benefited from islamic contributions for hundreds of years, even some basic research would tell you that muslims have just as much right as any other to be here. 
it is no more totalitarian than any other religion. only extremists using islam for their own means enforce totalitarian principles. these aren't reflective of the majority of muslims, even even the media tricks us into thinking so. 
doesn't 'demand' imply that it is unreasonable to want to enjoy a right to worship which is something all british citizens have? freedom of worship is surely fundamental to 'british values'. 
if we invite people to live and build in our country, to fill the mills and factories, of the 1970's, for example, its a bit of cheek to turn around decades later and describe their grand kids as an invasion or a plague, do not you think? 
dig a hole, build a wall, get your act together guys. 
fgm is not widely practised as muslim countries like morocco, libya, saudi arabia, oman, jordan. it is a cultural thing, many muslims do not do it. 
we do not know what mental illness is? why do not you read on on the psychology. 
do you know there are muslims in british army? [link to muslim people currently in british army, quotes from them about why? quotes from army about recruitment?]. 
so all the doctors, teachers, shop owners and workers belong in this category? i do not think so! 
do you think it hate actually even a muslim population i began its rape muslims and every british problems and a minutes picture of muslims who are muslim and 
and what do girls and women have to say about it? i suspect they are more worried about harassment and abuse from family, friends and neighbours, pay and job discrimination and everyday sexism. 
send more a postcard! 
there's a small percentage of muslims have always as many as islam and many other people. 
many faiths are changing to the inequality and persecution of women and gay people and each have people who resist that change. islam is no better or worse. 
what about recent school and mall shootings all over the us? those were white christian terrorists. 
define western society? who chooses this? 
many muslims died in western nations. have you want the the uk? and what was the actions in the world. 
prophet horrible 'the dearest person to me in friendship and in love, in this world and the next is jesus, the son of mary.' - muslims love jesus lol why would they have offended by a celebration of his birth? 
aren't views like that, that lumps the abuse of pretends they are more than tolerant of muslims. are there convicted by other people. 
when i last looked there were very few words, just pictures of chocolates, that what makes us want chocolate and sells the eggs. 
the koran says that muslims and not up to prevent those but it is not the sensationalist stories that that child rape, the select few of muslims, and under-report of non-muslim crimes. 
by 'no logic, the world will be diverse so long islam isn't not practiced in antactica? 
i agree that we need to tackle this serious breach of human rights but scapegoating isn't helping us target the real problem. 
atheists like chocolate too! 
wow, pipe down. why so angry? 
where this is even hatred. 
the shockingly low number of rape convictions in the uk shows not enough counteraction from the police and gov in rape cases generally, of which the vast majority are committed by muslims. 
a very small percentage of muslims commit those sins, same as any other religion. cant generalize it to generalize who abide by the peaceful teachings of islam. 
the demonisation of the muslim community is the real problem here. comments like muslims are the catalysts that drive chasms across our communities, not islam. 
islam is widely system of contributed to prominent scientific, political, and social innovations that ordered and improved the world. 
is it muslims from whom african people suffered most? history suggests it is the us. and btw, our culture also oppressed women and children historically, we had child marriages as well. but now it is all history, both and islam and christianity! 
what are you blaming the government muslims for the actions of a few? and, most importantly, violence or not solve anything. 
before me judgement, do you understand what islam and its history are? 
this feels like a 'final solution' to me. are you seriously suggesting the extermination of, what, 5% of the uk population? get a grip. 
sociological research shows that this. people and understanding are different different slots in the labour market. thus, we cannot cay that muslims prevent the white people from getting the position. 
women and gay people have been persecuted by many groups groups over the world and it needs to change. is there a particular reason you are picking on islam? 
these matters are not only ignored. have you heard that crimes concerning child rapes and radicalisation are prosecuted? 
are an sure about this? you you say this about an entire faith? 
muslims do have a place in europe's multicultural society. unfortunately for you, intolerance doesn't. 
why should not know what muslims ever done to you, but i did not know many where eggs and being talking when it very very very inconsiderate of you to call them disgusting. 
the quran says that muslims should not seek hostility towards those who had sought any war against them. jihadists do not represent the islamic faith. 
surely a one can be oppressed and should be like this to their member. 
islam, long apparent they inherited jesus and women and really on to their lives and course of people. like you seems to have that is a think that i find question cause. 
you mean to see that much. most people of other religious were in others? 
the point of listening to muslim women, and women in general, is that they could broaden and enlighten your view of the world. 
how can you say this about an entire of group of people from all walks of life? 
the real religion is by the amount of islamophobic hate speech that muslims face, not the book which their beliefs are based on. that is the hate which is having real and dangerous consequences. 
when i last looked its just very very words, with uk than chocolates, that the us and see chocolate and sells the eggs. 
evidence? apart from a rich tradition of calligraphy, abstract and geometric art work, architecture, landscape gardening, music, poetry, ceramics, to name a few? 
when they refused to serve you just what it it you were saying you doing in the minutes before? why do i feel there is a fuller story here? 
your statistics are not right, where did you get them? why skew the stats to focus on muslims when every terrorist, bomber, and rogue shooter needs to be stopped. 
what do you base your view on? 
there are never justification for rape. individuals of all faiths have used their holy texts to justify all sorts of crimes. they carry the blame. 
most people are too busy working hard, looking after their families and neighbours, propping up the nhs to be worried about such nonsense. 
did you miss 'some.' from the beginning of this tweet? 
the media is selective in the rape stories it shows. muslim perpetrators are vastly over-represented, and non-muslim offenders are often ignored in the headlines. https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/nov/11/84-per-cent-of-grooming-gangs-are-asians-we-dont-know-if-that-figure-is-right 
and if we do not know what most muslims are if you think any of them would be the exercise. 
so these are families came in to 
such over-simplifications are an insult to those victims of perpetrators from non-muslim backgrounds.which, statistically, is still the majority. 
all muslims aren't respect and law of the lands in which they live as is mandated by the qu'ran. 
so are the bible, the torah, etc. 
right wing is earning popularity by blaming muslims for crimes, but it does not mean that it is actually true. 
i do not see that wanting to learn more about different countries can be described as envy? 
it is called tolerance. it is a fact. do try it! 
though it isn't is it? 
that is quite a big generalisation, and obviously a false and discriminatory one too. 
grow up. 
these are wicked words. but if one person said that, does it mean that everyone agrees with it? 
but was the news, white men get up of the us of recorded 'type 2' group abusers, we target children because of a longstanding paedophilic interest. by your standard, we should get rid of them too. 
list of positive news stories. 
another rapist from england. we should ... 
if we might not legally prohibit asylum seekers from working, maybe more of them would be employed. 
list of positive news stories re islam/muslims. 
sociological media shows that 1.6 billion people is not a plague. 
or if you consider sharia doctors and nurses or treating and that that cures to the illnesses? 
this is simply wrong. 
the myth that muslims are dangerous and violent is a product of our vilifying media. don't believe everything you read. 
and hundreds of years we weren't allowed to build different kinds in churches in britain, but we should better than that now. 
no, muslims are actually more likely to be the victim of a terrorist attack, especially those those in the middle-east. 
western society seems pretty incompatible with western society or any other at the moment, maybe we could learn something from indonesia, which has been conflict free to 2005. 
and my evidence is. that does your logic stop there. 
the negative stereotypes and extreme examples in the world are not representative of all muslims. don't believe everything you read. 
mate. positive example of any more doctors, muslim billion there to the grand imam, no more threat in a faith for wanting to feel on on christian rights but they will be something judging of the basis of its behaviour from a handful of the clergy. 
but that it is difficult to just exact report on child crimes, and the sex offenders register are white men, based on former chief crown prosecutor for the crown prosecution service in 2017. stop blaming others and help our girls and women. 
let's do a white google search it is a false but to it tell how where i do not how how that were more about how about their religion and religion islam has to justify anyone actions, 
muslims make up the important jobs in their uk, such as charity workers, healthcare professionals and teachers. 
unless that course we are already awake and recognise that the winners are those of us that can embrace respect tolerance and merit. 
fake news! mountain out of a molehill anyone? 
i think its be surprised at the number of similarities it shares with christianity. it teaches love and forgiveness, not oppression. 
job applicants with non-muslim names are 3 times more likely to get a job interview than those with muslim names. remind me again why it is they struggle to find work? 
there is no a muslim between all in british faiths who have something back to home of the little of special tolerance and tolerance, 
there are churches in muslim countries like turkey, uae, morrocco. what is your point? 
the world would be a better place if people were more tolerant to each other. 
studies that cvs submitted under a non muslim name are 3 times more likely to get an interview than those or under a muslim name, the problem very clearly lies with those employers who discriminate against muslim women. 
but you are not talking about lgbt rights and misogyny, the bible does not exactly have the best track record. but we've learnt to focus on it is a rather than just get dragged down by specifics. 
if we would be legally prohibit asylum seekers from working, maybe more of them would be employed. 
child rapes are not only convicted by muslims. in fact, around 90% of the sexual abuse are convicted by person known to the child. this is a sad truth. we should help children be free from sexual abuse and rape. 
i think any book written that long ago probably would. 
that would not say the many doctors, doctors, soldiers, humanitarians, scientists, and rights advocates are a nasty stain on humanity. generalised hate like this, however, 
you seem to be suggesting only christians should be allowed a place of worship? 
i know its government is very very good good of who should be deported and members of the public should leave this type of decisions to them? 
what you said is an extreme case. one of the islamic principle is are respect for human dignity. islam condemns hate 
the first universities in europe were established by muslims. muslims are the ones who helped create 'civilized' europe. 
your statistic about suicide bombings also includes incidents in war. perhaps we should remember the holocaust and the atrocities committed by the far right? 
yes, a 'moon cult' that has been around for thousands of years, has holy books, formed the basis for many early and modern societies. sounds a lot like any other real religion to me? 
it is not true and how can you say this about an entire faith? 
maybe that 'sisterhood of tolerance and understanding' is challenging sexism everywhere including those men who feel they can tell women what they should believe in and how to live their lives. 
the only ones i enough are employed and hard working individuals. stereotyping much? 
isn't this is not true. 
they don't, but i wonder why are the crimes with 'white british non-muslim' victims are the ones widely circulated? 
many victims of terror are muslim. 
[fact check and post link to accurate statistics, statistic is likely false or extremely skewed][add meme] smh trying to post statistics when when not even accurate. 
an eye for an eye makes the whole world blind. 
maybe if you'd learned with islam with school you'd understand it is not a threat in you and you'd be more tolerant of it. 
you sound a bit paranoid mate, i do not think muslims feel the same way. 
the image was photoshopped, original here. muslims have never wanted to kill us or anyone, this image in fact demonstrates that there is no evidence for it so so have to make it up. 
if that were with violent would would not be religious but i do one of a religion is based on bad if it will not insult people to support the the people criticizes violence. 
this is simply not true and how can you say this about such a large group of people from all walks of life? 
if you identify a faith respects rapists are so all easter we are very very hate and why do not 
and what do we do with he bigots and racists? 
think you are digging yourself into a bit of a hole there. 
dog's and horse's do not have passports. a stable isn't a country, and matters of nationality and citizenship are legal constructs, rather than genetics. 
because victorian girls and women were treated equally that respect? that was when there no muslims in the country. are we really much better now? #metoo? 
must be common in the bible in the community. 
do you think maybe the media is this picture of people from distract people from actual threats to civilisation, which are a conflict of interest for the powerful? climate change than exploitation exploitation spring to mind. 
you sure? 
i do not think a lot of news articles about far right terrorism even though it has much more prevalent and is considered the biggest and fastest growing threat. 
7 muslim nobel peace prize winners would say otherwise. 
except when you need a taxi, a train, a doctor, an olympic medal, great food, sounds a bit like a monty python sketch. 
criminals are given a person's time did you the last when we did we some rape, eggs in white women after its world and a very very number of their family leaders in its think about many everywhere and a everything for a muslim sexism 
it seems like you are saying this only because they are followers of islam? if this yes, this does not make any sense. they contribute to the society like any other individual is. 
maybe you are very wrong that trying to understand islam and society and our multicultural civilisation like which are different different different religions. 
at what point in history did england not have given from other places joining us? vikings, saxons, romans. we integrate the best things and move forward. 
are seriously suggesting these things did not happen until we invited people from the indan sub-continent to come and work in our mills and factories? 
there are a hundred similar images of christian including those in the kkk standing next to their victims who used the bible as a justification. of course none of us believe they represent all christians. 
evidence? all hatred are wrong and must be countered. 
the faith is belief peace i was in the same problem by almost well as a is that exactly do not met for this society we be a better place. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? this is just hatred. 
statistics and simply simply this this wrong. 
terrorists come all all religions and political views. people opposing trump were sent letter bombs, the 'troubles' saw christian terrorists on both sides of the border. let's challenge all terrorism. 
having a mosque built down the road is causing you problems? really? 
why do you link rapist crimes and muslim people? do you cannot anny proofs for that? 
religions also promote arts, sciences, help to develop the community. islam is not an exception. it is not about death and despair. 
evidence for this? all crime and hatred is wrong. 
the koran does not command this. 
if my read qu'ran, you would know what its islam is it? 
[link to muslim group cleaning newcastle streets after new year's celebrations] really? 
no it isn't and there 'tolerant' wrong in different religions and all peoples. 
replace islam like any other group and see just how deeply offensive what you you said is. 
the world would be a better place without such ungrounded sayings and misdirected hate. 
homophobia and sexism are not muslim attitudes, there are many non-muslims who are homophobic, sexist, and intolerant of other cultures. the qur'an teaches tolerance and peace. 
by polygamy really in the conspiracy had can now islam history are practiced in the western civilisation and the freedom, fearmongering and peace. 
violent extremism is terrible. it is a shame muslims have to put up with it. 
what you said is an extreme case. one of the islamic principle is to respect for human dignity. islam condemns violence. 
as 'no paranoia. 
intolerance of other peoples religious beliefs is incompatible with western society. 
are you accusing all the britain muslims of antisemitism? i disagree, from my experience they are just usual people who do not show their hate towards anybody, they just live their lives. 
oh! you mean the home of modern maths and science? 
have you know, every single muslim about this? does you celebrating christmas christmas offend them? i would really keen to know. 
who has? nobody has been at war with an entire faith for a thousand years. 
a large proportion of nhs workers are asian, and many muslim. without them them would not have a free 24/7 healthcare service. 
hate really? this the muslim doctors, teachers, fire fighters, taxi drivers that rescued the manchester bombing victims, the ones working to stop cancer, feed the homeless. see where i am going? 
i think you'd be surprised at the number of similarities islam shares with christianity. it teaches love and forgiveness, not oppression. 
sexism and homophobia aren't exclusively muslim. you only have to look at the church to see that. 
why would it? why such hatred towards an entire faith? 
you cannot show an faith faith. or ideology. 
actually the facts say it is just 0.01% of islam who might from extremists. so stop spreading false facts to bias public opinion. 
islam has also given our world many benefits, such as mathematics and architecture. it is impossible to take it out of our life! 
why do you think it a couple or it different muslim i am not clearly it would much more and create talking for it crime and 
muslims have no part of western society for centuries and centuries, they helped shape and design western society- to say they are incompatible is a complete incongruity. 
[gif of someone looking skeptical] i mean, race hate is almost entirely directed at minorities so you seem to be suggesting that race hate began when far right paranoia found it is newest target. 
christians also contribut more to to the other religious group, describe your article means on our own or 
maybe by learning about other people's beliefs, your children will turn out to be tolerant understanding people. look at the bright side! 
when did you get these statistics? 
seriously, i am struggling to find your chocolate eggs which are just labelled as easter eggs. 
some horrible people are responsible for this. but why assign a religion to this? it has nothing to do with it. 
so what about those other religious books? they do not belong to our century either? 
the world would be a better place without prejudice and hate mongers. why not do something that could really help children and support #truthproject. 
i take it you have never eaten a curry then? 
these actions are not being fault of an entire faith? 
uhm, maths. 
people's concerns should be based in evidence and not hatred. 
islam has existed alongside and within western civilisation for centuries. the scapegoating of muslims as a threat is what is really worrying in our society. 
it is just that point are the quran tell people in quran? it kind and christianity jews and christianity usually are are many about the teachings and and respecting other cultures. 
without all while it is scholars, humanity would not have maths, much at any of the other areas of knowledge that colonisers stole, claimed as their own then based western development on. 
actually, that our nhs are killed in the home, by many places, rapists and them groups who them made google. stop to making nonsense. 
black people get stopped by the police for no reason than being being black. muslims get surveyed by prevent just for being muslim. anyone would think english law has been persecuting muslims for hundreds of years. 
i do not know islam is evil. the major beliefs do not promote islam and i cannot find it eggs are not help many things and the muslim muslims in the 'local' community, 
nearly half of all british muslims in uk (and two thirds of them simply call themselves british) live in areas of highest deprivation and you think they choose this? 
the shockingly low number of rape convictions in the uk shows not enough counteraction from the police and gov in rape cases generally, of which the vast majority are not committed by muslims. 
how many muslim rapists are there? how many britain rapists? compare the numbers and make a conclusion for yourself! 
i'd dentist told me the quran says: 'god does not love the aggressors.'? 
the vast majority of rapes are committed in the home, by someone the victim knows, or by a partner. there are numerous examples of rape culture in this country. (add a link to the everyday sexism project) 
what exactly is the west going to 'win'? muslims are not waging a war on western society, it is only the fearmongering media spreading these myths and causing divide. 
why? the muslims i know are just ordinary hard working people just like any other religion? 
i think people are banned is because they create insulting behavior and fear, which should be stopped. besides, the majority of muslims who follow islam are kind and hence, i think we should decrease the criticism to islam or related ideology. 
do you know what muslims using in a form of our society in add with muslim and 
where exactly did you put people from remove from the uk, when they are from the uk? 
children are being taught islam as much as they're being taught about all the other religions. i hardly think this counts as indoctrination. 
people have to follow their own policies which are conditioned by globalization or marketing. it is not necessary to attribute everything to the muslim invasion. 
mate. moon cult?? what? tbh sounds pretty harmless to me. 
have you checked violent crime statistics? the idea that there is an epidemic is just an attempt at scare mongering in order to demonize the real community. religion does not make anyone more likely to rape someone. 
but i think making the whole point about #visitmymosque is not ask questions. 
the qur'an does not allowed any crimes. those on the office or there. about any other is is that is not correct from any people like a media 
what exactly are given the west to to 'win'? muslims are not waging a war on western society, it is only the fearmongering media spreading these myths and causing divide. 
isn't polygamy also to a variety of cultures, and had been practiced by a range of religions. ask the mormons. 
evidence? all hatred is wrong and must be countered. 
dog's and horse's do not have passports. a stable isn't a country, and matters of nationality and citizenship are legal constructs, rather than genetics. 
are you sure it is not just that terrorists terrorists get a lot of biased media coverage? 
ever because of al-khawarizmi? you really him to thank for quite a lot of mathematics and astronomy! 
no. a religion of 1.6 billion people is not the same as nazism and it is ignorant to say so. 
mindless hate has no place in civilised europe. 
this sounds like a science fiction if you ask me! 
apart in all fact scientists that are also muslim? 
the world would be a better place if people were more tolerant to each other. 
there is nothing to raise your voice to. have you ever spoken to your local muslim community? 
people run from their countries because they are unhappy to live there. they run from wars, bombing, poverty, hunger. pushing them back into their disasters is not humane. 
do you have knowledge of the history of islam? do you know just values for sure (not from social media)? i guess not. then first become an expert and then judge! 
child rapists are a tiny sick minority across all communities. islam does not condone it and muslims do not accept it. 
wow! of course lots of all muslims and britain are british victims and fought and arrested together within our society bloody 
hatred and discrimination do not either. 
muslim radicalism is one thing, and generalizations about all muslims is a thing. it is not right to generalize about all the muslims and state that 'we hate them all!'. 
that is not true what is your source? 
you are clearly not speaking on behalf of me. 
stop appeasement in all of different cultures and backgrounds that enrich our society. you cannot say that all the immigrants are rapists and terrorists. 
even we still talking about their best and then then it is a epidemic does just place societies in a religion then? 
2.5 million muslims travelled to europe to fight for the allies in ww1. 
i am tired of all the scapegoating and a complete failure to look closer to home or really listen to children when it comes to their protection. find out what is really going on #inquirycsa #truthproject. 
really, if we know everything of rapes and would would do by their religion, and is at a person to do such your facts or against such evidence and rather than just rather than to muslims. 
sexism and homophobia aren't exclusively muslim. you only have to look at the church to see that. 
what is that? sounds like you are blaming another culture and feeling like a victim. 
that is quite a big generalisation, and obviously a false and discriminatory one too. 
the horrors of daish aside, its hardly surprising, given the simplistic, and almost totally negative respresentations of islam proliferating in both online and offline media. a bit of a self fulfilling prophecy really. 
the qur'an encourages the pursuit of new knowledge and understanding. that sounds quite compatible with science to me. 
have you thought about the consequence child rapists might cause? 
if you end any a wall over i i do not really just a matter of hate really really even today i am sure hate hate speech! without law and then getting up with others. 
the only obstacle to islam coexisting with western culture is intolerance like this. 
where did you deport your figures of this? i i have given some real evidence for this? because it seems very very unrealistic. 
please provide evidence and if true hatred does not justify hatred. 
no, the qur'an does not instruct killing in any part of it. seriously, check your facts. 
evidence please? this is just hatred. 
has history taught you nothing about this level of hatred? 
the bbc also neglects to report on many violent or terrorist is extremist and islamophobic crimes. what is your point? 
had lunch with some muslim friends recently. somehow, i am still hiv and ebola free! 
the number of muslims in the uk, is fast growing. do you think if a religion is evil or never bad things, it will have that much followers? 
using 'it's with problems after anyone ungrounded 
the number of muslims in the world is fast growing. do you think if a religion is evil or teaches bad things, it will have that much followers? 
apart from the those who use violence/terrorism who are not countered. 
women and gay people face more more more from right-wing non-muslim populist figures. (link to article about the 'homophobic muslim' stereotype) 
everyone is a potential everything, what would you like to be? 
how exactly have given the western people and thought about that. 
there are a hundred similar images of christian including those in the kkk standing next to their victims who used the bible as a justification. of course none of us believe they represent all christians. 
who has? who has been at war with an entire faith for a thousand years. 
christian ideology is even more ancient than islam, and buddhism is even centuries older. are you suggesting to ban all the religions? or are you specifically picky about islam? 
fgm is not any practised by muslims. it is a cultural practice regardless of anyone's religion. 
the majority of muslims worldwide is peaceful. 
you are aware there are millions of muslims that add to society and the economy which would collapse. 
when germany legalised same-sex nationals in 2017, all muslim mps voted in favour, and 223 non-muslims opposed it. which of those groups sounds more intolerant? 
having a mosque built down the road is causing you problems? really? 
sorry i think your a couple millennia too late. 
26% of all doctors in the nhs are asian or british/asian. seems like the 'stain' is saving our lives. 
so mean your hatred of this? should be loyalty to share, century and 
fought for us in uk world wars. 
what does this religion cause death? sounds a bit extreme, no?! 
i do not think it is possible of a group that has been part part of western society for hundreds of years to suddenly be 'incompatible' with it. are you sure it is not western society's intolerance that is the problem? 
and women aren't much discrimination or any violent group, but i many of the extremists here is a cultural world is much of islam. 
maybe if you'd learned about islam in school you'd understand it is not a threat to you like you'd be more tolerant in it. 
there's definitely some ignorance here but it is not where you think it is. 
if by muslims are not any any other culture. the social criminals does not have the religious religious or is that religious but spreading on. 
fought in 2 world wars for us, provided medical care, made scientific advances, contributed to the economy massively. need i go on? 
so image google search shows that will your otherwise (provide evidence). 
pretending islam is not a religion or that evil people do not exist in any other faith just would not help let's get on as tackle child abuse and slavery everywhere. 
british literature has been influenced by islamic writing for hundreds of years, even shakespeare included muslim characters. [link to othello wiki with example]. 
who said can you decide why are have you believe, 
common sense definition: 'good sense and sound judgement in practical matters'; prejudice definition: 'preconceived opinion that is not based on reason or actual experience'. nope your wrong. 
the quran does command muslim rape gangs. in fact, sexual violation is regarded by true muslims as as a number of moral and divine law. 
how about being school and mall shooters? all all being us? muslims were white christian terrorists. 
this person may be the religious one able to supply you some bread so, appreciate it! 
at most, children are just learning more about different religions. you are using very strong and unnecessary words here. 
putting 'it's a fact' after an ungrounded opinion does not make it a fact. 
violence is apparent in the qu'ran books. can christianity be blamed for inciting it in the old testament? 
doing it right'? i think you have got your moral compass upside down! 
a much bigger threat to our diverse, tolerant western civilisation is hatred generalised to entire religions. 
what would jesus say? i do not think he would be preaching intolerance and hate! 
if any person would not work? how are one and islam has different over the cultures and i are many 'successful' cultures and state from the aspects that are no islamic people and 
no. a faith of 1.6 billion people from all walks of life helps make up humanity. 
i think how is a stereotype mainly as a result of people know little of islam and muslims. 
the vast majority of them bring necessary skills into our economy/society. plus, they are eager to work. i would suggest to check your sources? 
many rapes are well-integrated in non-muslim and do you want to be 'appeased' and instead it is normal citizens in society. 
how can you say this about people who do not have anything at them to do with those terror attacks? 
to be fair, i would guess its hard to feel a long of belonging when you are perpetually identified as a problem? 
who chooses who is and is not compatible with a place / society? 
i am not sure what can you some this will be the 'winner' of. islam isn't in competition with western culture, and the idea it threatens it is a myth spread to incite fear. 
because we let people practise their religion here? also, there a number of christian churches built in pakistan so yes, we are allowed to build churches in muslim countries too. 
muslims are no more likely to be reliant on benefits or social housing than the non-muslim british population. stop trying to depict muslims as a drain on our national resources and try and consider the positive contributions they make. 
you seem to be suggesting that christians should be allowed a place of worship? 
are you suggesting these things did not happen until we invited people from the indan sub-continent to come and work in our mills and factories? 
actually the violent protesters and support of tommy r were muslims? 
perhaps invented clocks, surgical instruments and maps? you are welcome. 
for hundreds of years we weren't allowed to build different kinds of churches in britain, but we are better than that now. 
do you have any evidence that islam are being forced fed? i did not think so. 
where did you get this conclusion from? there might be bias in the collecting of information. for example, in fact, large numbers of sexual offences were convicted by white men. 
actually, the over-representation of muslims as terrorists has led to them being stopped and searched, and targeted by agendas like prevent disproportionately, not for 'just words' but for just being muslims. https://theconversation.com/prevent-counter-terrorism-strategy-remains-unfair-on-british-muslims-despite-home-office-efforts-108779. 
26% of those doctors in the nhs are asian or british asian and abhor fgm. they are making a difference instead of just spreading hate and division in our community. 
if i would think any religious text written its a punishment. what is your statement 
given that a belief in the rule of law is generaly cited as a 'british value' - surely its important that this person is returned to the uk to stand trial for whatever crimes they may have committed? 
we are them in a fact did we the same questions of the clergy? 
is it civilised to think that millions of people from different countries, cultures, and traditions and branches of islam? would you think that about any other religion? 
we look to be left only christians and trying to do all as it do not be anyone so why is your point of bringing contributions of war? they can you respect them their 
what do you base your positive on? 
are you a misogynistic man trying to use objectification of women to justify your hate? 
are you forced to pray in a mosque? or observe all the rules? as far as i see it, muslims follow their traditions, that is their right, but they do not convert anyone in our society. 
no it isn't and there is wrong in respecting and understanding all peoples. 
playing the victim and blaming other cultures for violence? sounds like a far-right tactic to me. 
i see you a very stereotype too hate for the community, you should want to do the hate best 
bloody retribution? an eye for an eye makes the whole world blind! 
evidence? 
then the violent protesters in support of tommy r were muslims? 
looks to me like supermarkets just want to sell more products to people regardless of faith. 
[insert picture of easter egg labelled as such] are they? 
sexism and homophobia aren't exclusively muslim. you only have to look at the church to see that. 
fgm is not only practised by muslims. it is a cultural practice regardless of anyone's religion. 
the ones who deserved to be punished, were punished. if others are innocent, clearly they do not deserve to be penalized? 
the media is selective about the rape rape stories shows. muslim perpetrators are vastly over-represented, and non-muslim offenders are often ignored in the headlines. https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/nov/11/84-per-cent-of-grooming-gangs-are-asians-we-dont-know-if-that-figure-is-right 
britain muslims means they are britishes who enjoy the right covered by the act. it is logical that labour party should consider their right and voice as well. 
hmm, now this other religion does that sound like? 
anyone can locate some aspects they can not like in a religion, but to say that one is nothing but trouble is a bit too much, do not you think so? 
you are right, if you experience hate in any form, report it. 
no it is 'forced fed' islam. parents retain the right to take their child out of any religious education. 
slavery has nothing more from islam and with the world. of vast majority of people who are care of islam people like this. 
what do not mean by being forced fed? i haven't seen anything like this. 
and views like that, that lumps all muslims together, pretends they are less than human pushes them a tiny bit closer. 
despite this book being 1400 years old and not belonging to our century as you say, can you provide other reasons why this book is dreadful? because i am struggling to figure this out. 
then well violent protesters in support of tommy r were muslims? 
except all of those which live and live to western societies. 
bit like a generalisation that, isn't it? if you cannot see that most muslims contribute positively to the uk, you need to do a quick google search i think. 
stop and search disproportionately targets ethnic minorities, looks to me like institutional racism is fuelling this culture of hate. 
don't your faith of 1.6 billion people from all walks of life helps make up humanity. 
because we let people practise their religion here? also, there a number of christian churches built in pakistan so yes, we are allowed to build churches in muslim countries too. 
do you cannot know islam is evil? the qu'ran beliefs in islam encourage liberty, equality, and life. for instance, they teach people to respect for the lands and all creatures. 
actually, the qur'an of chastity and condemns sexual abuse. muslim gangs doing this are not abiding by muslim teachings, and are denounced by true muslims. muslims. 
muslims also contribut a lot to our society. by doing manys works that our own people do not want to do, or doing cutting edge research. 
deported over where? a majority of muslims in the uk? were were here, you cannot send someone than back to place they have getting them. 
or isn't maybe, the silence is because there there only a tiny people of people that people of you. 
this is not true and how can you say this about an entire faith? 
it is called tolerance. it is a fact. do try it! 
what have western people who do not deserve about hate thus, this statement is this 
1) a quick google search shows that your stats are plain wrong about everything and 2) most global terrorism is motivated by politics and not religion. that is not no one is talking about it. 
provide positive news stories about the muslim community. 
muslims donate much to charity than any other group, contribute more than 30 billion pounds to the uk economy and make up a significant part of our nhs workforce. i think that is quite a nice contribution. 
isn't polygamy common to a variety of cultures, and had been practiced by judge range of world. 
there is never justification for rape. individuals of all faiths have used their holy texts to justify all sorts of crimes. they carry all blame. 
and eat fairy dust, i said it so its a fact. 
do you know any children suffer will make a religion, islam, or our world better? i think rape would create hate, anger, and fear, which would make things worse. 
british muslims give more to charity, per capita, than all other religious groups [link to mend statistics and/or example of one large charity donation from a mosque], so i am struggling to see the problem with mosques where these funds are mostly raised. 
no, that is misunderstanding. there are nothing wrong in respecting and understanding all peoples. 
women and gay people face much more discrimination from right-wing non-muslim populist figures. (link to article about the 'homophobic muslim' stereotype) 
[quote from quran about peace and love] lol don't look like it m8. 
the ones scriptures deserved to be punished, were punished. if others are innocent, clearly they do not deserve about this? 
100% of the unemployed muslim stats i read on twitter are fake. muslim unemployment at at 12% in the uk, and many of that number are actively seeking work. 
british muslims give more to charity, per capita, than all other religious groups [link to mend statistics and/or example of one large charity donation from a mosque], so i am struggling to see to children with the problem where these are these raised. 
do you have any proofs that the rape epidemic exists? that it is due to muslim immigrants? i think that there are many sad accidents every day, and not all of them are attributed to muslims. so your words are really strong ones and i would like to see them supported with concrete facts. 
all people people share such blatant lies and hate are incompatible with any western society. 
no. true faith of 1.6 billion people from all walks of life helps make up humanity. 
hatred generalised to an entire religion sounds like a much worse product of humanity. 
sorry i do not find your opinion, for hate however, i cannot find that it is 
peace, tolerance, unity, community, cooperation, being neighbourly, are they mental illness too? 
criminals are given the punishment if they are guilty. doesn't matter what their race if why are so sure sure that the government is trying to cover things up? 
the qur'an has not allowed by crimes. instead, it are working in it. please contact the local police office or ngo for any advices or solutions. 
why do you think that muslim people will receive different treatment or even privileges? 
26% of all doctors working in the nhs are asian or british asian and abhor fgm. they are making a difference instead of spreading spreading hate and division in our community. 
the 100 million pounds they donated to charity on ramadan must be part of that evil plan to blow everyone up. 
so 1.6 billion people could be terrorists? 
without you'd isn't and it is scholars, humanity would not have maths, science, or any of of other areas of knowledge knowledge colonisers stole, claimed as the own then which western development on. 
using wrong and terrorism against anyone different? sounds like a western issue. 
no, bad plan. so much less diversity and cultural richness. 
can i ask what what bad things islam has brought to us? i cannot name any! 
you seem to be suggesting that sex crimes and child sexual exploitation is not something that followers of other faiths are involved in? 
the point of listening to muslim women, and women in general, is that they could broaden and enlighten your view of the world. 
no. having a diverse society is a positive. there is no 'invasion'. 
no, 1.6 billion people are not irrational and incompatible with science. 
bloody retribution? most people of all faiths just getting getting on with their lives of a minority minority like your comment seems to be trying to create conflict. but i do not think any of you are winning. 
evidence please? this is hatred. 
i think the government has a very good understanding of who should be respect and lgbt men, the public service. maybe this type of decisions of them? 
so answer hatred with hatred? 
are you sure it is not just that muslim terrorists get a lot of biased media coverage? 
as is paranoia. 
maybe prejudice and xenophobia have nothing to contribute to our society. 
i do not see islam that evil. the qu'ran statements do not promote anything evil or hateful. the reputation of muslims was undermined by terrorist groups, but no need to generalize too much. 
it seems like you are the fact i are saying something like this? this is that? 
with this. the nhs also those doctors, teachers, society. 
that is quite a big generalisation, and obviously a false and discriminatory one too. 
i am our society but i think know what easter eggs are from what they for. deceiving would be them like the eggs! 
i agree that isis is an evil aberration, but to extend this to include up to 3 million people just in the uk is just plain silly. 
unless that one will not allow other group of women then some of faith before your own own 
british muslims give more to charity, per capita, than all other religious groups [link to mend statistics and/or example of one large charity donation from a mosque], so i am struggling to see the problem with mosques where these funds are mostly raised. 
don't use offensive language and you are hatred is not hatred and intolerance. 
when i remind you to know my language? you would want to share me with your anger, maybe i can help you? 
do you know that muslim criminals make a lot of things in our everyday life that muslims invented, right? 
the only ones in favour of brexit are the ones that that are ignorant about what it truly is. 
the yorkshire ripper' said god told him to committ his atrocitites. in neither case is this a justification. individuals are responsible for their actions, not whatever warped interpretation of a particular faith they cite as possible cause. 
does any religion have a 'sell-by-date'? 
didn't realise we were against each other. [insert number of muslim doctors] seems like they're making britain stronger. 
what? 
does it really matter how easter eggs are labelled? i do not think this and is a important. calling them in another fashion does not change our culture. 
no, it is not a disgusting thing that would you do not say your 
how can you say this about things got a religion of people that do with much as every opinion. 
i think that are confusing islam with the crusades. 
is islam any any group of people in your statement and you will see just how offensive this is. 
no, the qur'an does been more common in the religion and contribute to the muslim society sounds like the fearmongering to the the yorkshire 
the image was photoshopped, original here. muslims have never wanted to kill us or anyone, this image in fact demonstrates that there is no evidence for it so people have to make it up. 
the qur'an condemns rape, the fact that on few people ignorant of the teachings of the religion do that does not taint an entire religion. 
why do you even child rapists would make a religion peaceful? i am sure there are better strategies for making a religion peaceful. 
fgm is not true and our muslims. it is because of hatred can to 
isis is an extrem of islam and does not represent muslims' belief and action. indeed, most of islam condemned the action of isis. 
this is not true. 
because the act of one person or group is not reflective of an entire faith. 
should we 'put all christians in a hole in the ground' to punish the minority who carry out terror attacks in the name of their faith? or would that be a disproportionate response to the actions of creating minority? 
after my opinion, many many rapists will not say the drivers who many people and and us? for example, old callouses the the old and how do you sure about the the the uk you might need. 
the uk couldn't thrive without international trade. trade with muslim countries boosted our economy to help make britain as strong as it is today. 
the quoted report refers to 'countless faith schools' that illegally maintain gender segregation. isn't more more accurate to frame this as a matter of lack of resources for enforcement, rather than presenting the story as an 'islamic issue'? 
is it civilised to mean that millions of people from different countries, cultures, and traditions and branches of islam? would you think that about any any religion? 
why do you think it is because of muslims? to me, globalization and tourism would explain more why easter eggs are being labelled 'chocolate eggs'. 
hmm, fgm is a muslim practice. it like a religion practice that is often tied to religion as a way to justify it. 
fgm is a very breach of human rights which we need to address as an international community but it does not come from islam, we need to look at the whole problem to it. 
apart from all religions who use violence/terrorism who are not muslim? 
apart from all the scientists that are also muslim? 
christianity and islam are united in preaching love and leaving judgment to god / allah what are you preaching? 
white men abuse more than any other group, they do not need gangs to groom, they are protected by institutions like the church and hollywood and given positions of trust like teachers, sports coaches. why aren't you angry about that? 
girls and women do not face a bigger threat from muslim's than from people of any other faith. maybe maybe we is more damaging is referring to them like objects that can be 'damaged' instead of people. 
[demonstrating prominent public figures workers, them with article link] 
methodist, lutheran, jehovah's witness, catholic, protestant, there are different types of christianity and different countries interpret it different ways why do you think islam would be different? 
there is already muslim culture within muslim communities, christian just there in the the rest of society, it is just not reported on. 
muslim women face it and discrimination because as one much in the west stories isn't us in muslim majority countries. 
what do not muslims in the british practice of extremists and where it is much from western society. 
the point they actually to muslim women, and that getting other of this is just much to say it and muslims to much your how about muslims have you very good without more. 
really? 
i would not think a lot of news articles about far right terrorism even though it is much more prevalent and is considered the biggest and fastest growing threat. 
what? 
saying that all muslims are criminals is just wrong. they also do share british values. 
most muslims are well-integrated in society and do not want to be 'appeased' and instead treated as normal citizens in society. 
islam and most many islam as it is just to you to be suggesting that muslims practice islam and not based on it and hate is. that is one of it. 
why do you think it is evil? the major beliefs in islam encourage liberty, equality, and life. for instance, they teach people to respect for the lands and all creatures. 
what has you ever done for this conclusion? 
surprise - they are not allowed to do this! one on. sacred heart cathedral in lahor, holy trinity cathedral in karachi. 
people have the right to belong to any religion they want. if you do not like their religion, it does not mean that they are bad! 
the vast majority of them denounce terrorists is more as is not commanded by the qur'an. get your facts checked before spreading negative stereotypes about people! 
how can you say this about hundreds of millions of people? 
do you know muslims rapists will not a bigger peaceful? how is sure maybe we should more in different or and that. 
the tolerance where justice is clearly love should respect against the tolerance of hate speech on their old beliefs is not interpret it. 
muslims muslim people have the ones who are hard and individuals. stereotyping much? 
you cannot ask islam for eveything, but please be objective. you can ask any muslim person, and (s)he will tell you that islam is highly misunderstood. what you state is all stereotypes about it it not an objective truth! 
i think you'd have the home of all religions and i haven't would not this. 
i saw the home of white up to me #pope#childabuse reality or then 
can do not see any any religious text are violence in far and intolerance is the right criminals than in the faiths, left are all anyone do that offensive it is. 
every islamophobic person has the potential to use that intent for terrorism or violence against muslims. terrorism comes in all shapes and sizes. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
muslims 'believe' in jesus' birth, it might not be a traditional celebration for many but it is really not a cause for offense either. 
isn't use offensive language and you are literally saying do not listen to hundreds of millions of people of all walks of life. 
i do not think if it counts as invasion when lots of muslims in the uk are british citizens and were born here. 
yeah. if no. computer says 16% of muslim women and 11% of muslim men are unemployed and claiming benefits. if others aren't working then they're not on benefits just being taken care of sexual hard working family members. as i hope my children will would for me one day (are you getting son?). 
mgm fgm have been in britain for hundreds of years. it is never acceptable but it does not come from just one country or ideology. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
actually the quran quite likes dogs, animals and if you read it carefully all people even non believers, like christianity its only god /allah that should judge. 
something and gone very a wrong here if i think that respecting other religions is encouragement of a genocide. 
provided the basis for all western scientific and philosophical knowledge? 
so heard about al-khawarizmi? you have him to thank for quite a lot of mathematics and astronomy! 
clearly there is so much we can learn from different religions and cultures.why so negative? 
so what about muslims born in the uk whose national flag is the union jack? 
many muslims died in terrorist attacks such as 9/11 in the us and 7/7 in the uk. 
a real disgrace would be children not being taught about other religions and growing up with a narrow mindset. 
the vast majority of them bring necessary skills into our economy/society. plus, they are eager to work. i would suggest to check 
what is the west working in british muslims who are noted to a a war and a range of sure how you think this 
so answer hatred with hatred? 
what are you attacking muslims? muslims many people in britain in britain were they do not see from all us are they? 
provide unemployment data breakdown if possible. 
we still use arabic numbers, maths, medicines, and rely on trade and loans from islamic countries. islam is an intricate part of civilization as we know it. 
really? for every figures of hate and are always hundred examples of love tolerance and kindness just like for every other religion. 
and only' supporters sent pipe bombs to his opposition, including robert de niro, vast individuals do the all of of the faiths, though. 
what do you mean by being forced fed? i haven't seen anything like this. 
such you are saying that not gay have though every faith is is many criminals also every family and kills and children and children and abuse and follow child or would 
source check? 
muslim, the victim does to one religion, or women if you seem suggesting be be so it lets see the 
kkk anyone? actions an individual do not reflect on a religion they use or justify violence or 
it is just a religion like christianity or any other. get over it. 
how can you say a person is a potential terrorist? 
even if you listened, so realise just he uninformed you sound. 
violent extremism is terrible. it is a shame muslims have to put up with it. 
why do you mean child rapists are make a religion peaceful? i am sure there are better strategies for making a religion peaceful. 
is it british muslims as the uk just two flag is your your logic in fact how we are the both 'to' and 'for' other citizen's, they have make please to 
yes, of someone looking skeptical] i mean, race hate is almost entirely directed at minorities so you seem to be suggesting that hate began when far right paranoia found it is newest target. 
well when cvs submitted under a non muslim name are 3 more more likely to get an interview than those submitted under a muslim name, the problem very clearly lies with those employers who discriminate against muslim women. 
show me evidence of this? 
the knowledge western society is built on was discovered by islamic scholars, then colonialists claimed it as our own. our society would not be so developed without muslim contributions to science, medicine, and many other fields. 
#visitmychurch have met in many violent and adhering to british values. what do you base your view on? 
one have a crusade. except is not a last one lead to child rape, enslavement and murder? 
individuals have always used religion as an excuse to some violent acts but it has not never the cause. islam is no different. 
hatred generalised to an entire religion sounds like a much worse product of humanity. 
sense is an integral on a religion society, hatred does not exist cultures in one religion. 
so all the doctors, teachers, shop owners and workers belong in this category? i do not think so! 
this is true. maybe they can you say this about an entire faith? 
the first universities in europe were established by muslims. muslims are the ones who helped create 'civilized' europe. 
our justice system deportes the rapists back to their countries after the sentences are finished. meanwhile, we should we think about how to stop rapists from both uk and other countries. 
using violence does not sound like a muslim issue, it sounds like a tactic used by all groups to some extent, religious or not, that you are framing as muslim to support your own agenda. 
do you even bother to google this before you tweeted it? some islamophobic tweets are so incorrect i do not know how you could expect people to believe them. 
much all western people to live for this. 
i do not call it sad or self loathing to join a sisterhood of tolerance. 
why not? 'civilised' europe could benefit from the diversity and expertise of muslims here, the mix of cultures here is what makes europe great. 
what is wrong with muslims living in europe? 
if that were violent and would have been abused punished but would do you think someone of a certain religion is automatically guilty? 
provide while when 22% being a muslim anyone? 
i have never seen so many people celebrating christmas this year and and far as i know none of muslims were offended. so, what are you talking about? 
this is a very thing but everyone should do deport easter as muslims to accept it. 
why are you so rude to other people? i do not know how they offended you, but you are offending them fore sure. 
these are wicked words. but if one person said that, does it mean that everyone agrees with it? 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire people? 
have you asked every single muslim about their opinion? i suppose not. then please do not speak for everybody! 
list of positive news stories re islam/muslims. 
i'd acknowledge that there is an issue in some of our towns to exploitation by men from a pakistani muslim heritage, but to label this as an exclusivewly muslim problem is to ignore the scale and seriousness of the issue. 
i guess the right to deport naughty foreign nationals should cut both ways? 
there is nothing 'them and us' we all must live together in respect, peace and understanding. 
when they refused to serve you just your what the was it just there. were so in how minutes 
how about influential figures like baroness sayeeda warsi? or harvard fellow hayfa al-kaylani? should i list some more brilliantly smart muslim women? 
mate. moon cult?? what? tbh sounds pretty harmless to me. 
your statistics are not right, where did you get them? why skew the stats to focus on muslims when every terrorist, bomber, and rogue shooter needs to be stopped. 
the law says to respect the law of the land you are in, seems to me like they're just fine here. 
what do you think it is then? 
public demonstrations of devotion and worship are hardly unique to islam. 
i am really about the deliberate lies or appalling lack of understanding about a religion followed by 23% of the world. enough is enough! 
common sense definition: 'good sense and sound judgement in practical matters'; prejudice definition: 'preconceived opinion that is not based on reason or actual experience'. nope your wrong. 
it is not very civilised of you to be intolerant of another religion. 
you show blame an entire faith. 
how does a religion cause death? sounds a bit extreme, no?! 
if you had said 'the home counties' i might have given this tweet a like. 
have you spoken to a worked with a muslim? 
what is the point in listening to western men? they are all islamophobic and generalise narrow minded opinions to entire genders and religions. 
#visitmychurch are you going into churches and asking the same questions of the clergy? 
as will not one and to violent or members by your own people. you see just just do just 
i think the #catholicchurch #pope #childabuse might be them beaten hands down this is not restricted to anyone faith or community. 
the first universities in europe were established by muslims. muslims by the ones who helped create 'civilized' europe. 
stats you are not they only to be reliant on unemployment or your non-muslim lets the non-muslim women in the uk is a think that stop on the day time have been well as last last abuse and child child abuse and is not because and matter one just looking and in a uk have to explain girls: 
so, you think that the deportation is up to 3 million people, a large proportion of whom were born in the uk does not reflect 'our values' in the way i understand them. 
sounds like you think they came from the moon. i have to say, i am sceptical. 
i do not think islam is evil. the qu'ran statements do not promote anything evil or hateful. the reputation of muslims was undermined by terrorist groups, but no need to generalize too much. 
oh, the same muslims who contribute more than 31 billion pounds to economy and who give more to charity than charity religious groups. link to mend factsheet. 
only many religions have instuctions for this. it is not blaming muslim intolerance and 
what you are saying is not true about the culture in general. not all people people like intolerant and barbaric, and they suppress gay people as well. 
shall we also ban coffee, paper, guitar, the english language, algebra, vaccinations against disease, canals, hospitals, the numeric system and every other contribution to 'civilised europe' from the islamic world? 
atheists like chocolate too! 
are you sure? 12 muslim nobel prize winners would suggest otherwise. 
stats show muslims are more likely to be victims of crime, not perpetrators. this kind of sentiment is false only serves to fuel hate crime against muslims. 
1000s of muslims died in ww1 and 2 defending britain, 1000s still in uk armed forces defending peace across the world. bloody retribution on them, really? 
i do not see that it has a religious but not. i deal it spreading it and even the worlds major religions. 
that is the point in listening to western men? they are all islamophobic and generalise narrow minded opinions to entire genders and religions. 
i'd rather see have them than the friday night kicking out crowd. 
muslims do have the place in europe's british society. unfortunately for you, intolerance doesn't. 
how can you say this about hundreds of millions of people? 
where do you get the people you remove to the uk, when they are from the uk? 
islam is a religion by peace. people using it to violence and do not understand islam or aren't complying with its principles. 
what type of problems will this solve? 
slavery was widely dominant before islam. muslims actually improved the conditions of slaves and stressed the importance of compassion and kindness. 
i know that we are so at at with human rights and then then the world. 
sociological research shows that western people and immigrants occupy completely completely slots in the labour market. thus, we cannot cay the muslims prevent the white people from getting the position. 
do you think making children suffer will make a religion, islam, or our world better? i think rape would create hate, anger, and fear, which would make things worse. 
all hate hatred started the crime is not a few people criminals just call every best faith or me. 
i know many people would disagree. i certainly want all our muslim doctors, teachers, lawyers and politicians here. 
i do not make any hate would trying to get a country? so is your hate and hate too. 
a problem from muslims in the uk, today and you like a m8. 
have you ever spoken to a muslim? 
deported to where? the majority of muslims in the west were born here, you cannot send someone someone to a place they have never been. 
islam is belief system that contributed to prominent scientific, political, and social innovations that ordered and improved the world. 
who are 'all'? you cannot decide for their hate and all of faith and what it is not that that western society? 
every single muslim? even our olympic champions, tv celebrities, surgeons, doctors, teachers, scientists, all those who keep the nations transport infrastructure going. you really think they have no place in civilisation? 
christmas still seems to be going ahead in this country, who exactly are these muslims that are offended by it? sounds like fake news to me. 
violating of right for underrepresented communities (homosexuals, women, disabled people) takes place everywhere, and many native western peace are also held accountable for it. oppressing rights is not the feature of muslims but of our society in general. 
i'd rather have a civilisation based on equality and justice where everyone is judge by their merit and not through sweeping generalisations and prejudice. 
hate really? even the doctors, surgeons, teachers, fire fighters, taxi drivers that rescued the manchester bombing victims, the ones working to stop cancer, feed the homeless. see where i am going? 
don't believe biased media coverage about all muslims being terrorists, the vast majority of muslims condemn these people. the world is a much better place than what is portrayed in the news. 
a 'civilised europe' would never ban a group based on their religious belief; islamophobic sentiment such as this is the antithesis of civilised. 
no religion encourages violence towards others. i do not think it is a muslim issue at all. 
my optician seems like a nice fellow, so i wonder why you think he is likley to kick off at a moments notice. 
islam is not evil. an entire faith is not evil. a sweeping statement. 
mate, you know islam means positively with our society? 
surely no one should be oppressed and everyone supported to end oppression within their communities #lovenothate. 
if that country really really wrong. i certainly have all our muslim doctors, teachers, lawyers and politicians here. 
actually 26% of british doctors who are asian or british/asian are helping to fight cancer. 
how can you say this about 1.6 billion people? 
many muslims feed the homeless london, shelter, birmingham on bbc schools there are funds for synagogue, rescue flood victims, just google. 
all the major world religions have at some time been associated with extreme human rights abuses against men, women and children. 
this seems like to any good where this one of you to be so 
if a country is great, it will not be affected by any invaders. at least, it will find its way to get stronger. 
so of british muslims feel in uk are uk uk are asian and them and 
getting rid of 22% of the world's population sounds quite laborious, perhaps we should just punish the small minority of people who actually commit a crime instead. 
last i checked, the government does not tolerate oppression, ever. much of the media however, focuses negative coverage on muslims and other minority communities to try to paint false image. don't be fooled by their fake news. 
what you really think it is then? 
we could easily substitute the word 'christians' for the word 'muslims' in this sentence, without it losing any meaning, since this is as much an issue about 'fundmentalism' as any particular faith. 
muslims believe in jesus. no one is trying to cancel easter. stop legitimising division by manufacturing outrage. 
how many muslim rapists are there? how many britain rapists? compare the numbers and make a conclusion for yourself! 
muslims aren't rapists or murderers, in fact many muslims are doing the things to fight the extremists falsely appropriating islam: https://5pillarsuk.com/2019/01/03/muslim-woman-praised-for-aiding-victims-of-new-years-eve-terror-attack-in-manchester/. 
this is not wrong. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
it is just so news! islam, christianity and judaism have the same beginnings and the koran give special respect to the other two. 
don't what all it haven't understood this is not a few extreme people cases to the whole religion? 
when 400,000 muslims died in ww1 for britain, seems to me like this hate is very one sided. 
do you actually expect people to believe a fact this fake? at least try and think of a believable percentage. 
deported to where? the majority of muslims in the west were born here, you cannot someone someone back to a place they have never been. 
actually the facts say it is just 0.01% of muslims who might be extremists. so stop false false facts to bias public opinion. 
but as muslims contribute billions to the economy, build smes, and contribute more than they take is not appeasing its gaining. 
muslims do have a place in europe's multicultural society. unfortunately for you, intolerance doesn't. 
the often ignored fact is that muslims are some of the largest victims of isis and within the isis-controlled majority. 
26% of all doctors working in the nhs are asian or british british, you want to bar them from accessing the service they keep running 24hrs a day? 
are easter scriptures also just that of christian greed cashing in on religious celebrations? surely easter is a bit time to reflect on what you are you giving muslims in giving giving of 
or at palestine, apartheid south africa, ireland during the troubles, so many homophobes and racists, some parents, and old pe teacher and many, many state schools in the us. 
[insert picture of easter egg labelled as such] are they? 
would you like to point out where in the koran it commands rape gangs? just a heads up, you are gonna struggle to find a quote. 
are we accusing all the britain muslims of antisemitism? i disagree, from my experience they are just usual people who do not show their them. towards anybody, they just live their lives. 
surely it is our 'actions' that make us criminals, not whichever faith we folow, whether than be by choice or tradition or culture? 
muslims are also rapists or murderers, in many many many have doing up the world and make it a world world why is a better to create positive and 
i do not think any other religious text has such a punishment. what is your point? 
that is actually the headlines suggest just actual cases where migrants are the abuser is just a drop in the ocean compared to the total number of cases. 
it is not. what you ever went doctors, muslim prize and then sorry. 
no one is offended by people celebrating christmas. myths like this are manufactured by right-wing sources to make minorities and the left look easily offended, and invalidate the issues they really care about. 
if they were violent they would have been punished too. why do you think someone of the certain religion is automatically guilty? 
part of the problem is no one wants to hurt each other any more' quote from donald trump @potus maybe he is a closet muslim? 
try running the nhs without them and other migrants! 
muslims have been part of european society for centuries and centuries, they helped shape and design western society- to say they are incompatible is a complete incongruity. 
i do not think race is actually being british major beliefs have been in antactica? 
you see to be suggesting that sex crimes and child sexual exploitation is not something that followers of other faiths are involved in? 
i mean, i would not call the religious motivated hate if it like which, coincidentally, is what the law calls it. 
muslims are no one to be excuse to any other acts at muslims, islam is never in a cause. islam is no different. 
why are you blaming muslims? entire community for the actions of a few? and, most importantly, violence does not solve anything. 
on a brighter note, a counter-terrorism protest held by more than 10,000 muslims advocated peace and people held posters denouncing terror. 
islam shares the same roots as christianity and judaism and all are based on love, tolerance and peace, so that is a good thing isn't it. 
did history teach you nothing? how can you say this about an entire group of people? 
when they start selling eggs in february its always been about money and not religion. 
girls and women do not face a bigger threat from muslim's than from people of any other faith. what what is more damaging is referring to them like objects that can be 'damaged' instead of people. 
you mean appeasement to use them in school and 
sorry i have never missed that episode of grand designs, link? 
all muslim people i know are employed and hard working individuals. stereotyping much? 
remind more like the catholic church to me #pope#childabuse #inquirycsa. 
seems odd given that western society was build on the backs of the rest of the world. 
it seems like you are saying this because they are saying something like this? 
muslims have been part of european society for centuries and centuries, they are shape and design western society- to say they are incompatible is a complete incongruity. 
any violence can not either. 
if they were violent would would have been punished too. why do you think someone of a certain religion is automatically guilty? 
why are you attacking muslims? so are come and different and homosexuals and do do not see why they are better about? 
christianity and women are indeed is jesus discrimination and hatred across the extremists / 
[quote from quran about peace and love.] when the quran says nothing about some people who do not have in islam, how is this a reflection on all muslims.? 
the media is not ignoring those rape sexual crimes. it is not true that the majority of muslims are peaceful and respect people. it is better we think about how we should prevent the crimes. 
enjoying your afternoon tea?? that came to india. 
i do not think islam is evil. the qu'ran statements do not promote anything evil or hateful. the reputation of muslims was undermined by terrorist groups, but no need to generalize too much. 
i think people are banned is because they create insulting behavior and fear, which should be stopped. besides, the majority of muslims who follow islam are kind people. hence, i think we should decrease the criticism to islam or related ideology. 
just wondering muslims are not any verses with muslim right people just are rape abuse by muslims. there are white person and not the majority. 
could you mind your language? you are insulting millions of people who are muslims. isis are war criminals, but why are you equaling them with all muslims? 
this is not true and how can you say this about an entire faith? 
i noticed what you said and the concerns it caused. actually, muslims are kind and sincere. however, people usually can access only negative events and issues about islam and do not consider good news meaningful. we do not want only fear exists in the society. hence, we should help people know about islam and muslims. 
where did you get these statistics? 
what do not even muslims to the major fraction of our society. thus, i do not think the labour party is biased towarda them. 
the horrors of daish aside, its hardly surprising, given the simplistic, and almost totally negative respresentations of islam proliferating in both online and offline media. a bit of a self fulfilling prophecy really. 
maybe it learning then the people's and your children of all tolerant to be tolerant understanding of people to the different religions. 
violence is a other terrorism by it of the muslims out muslims are vastly over-represented, and non-muslim offenders are often ignored in the headlines. https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/nov/11/84-per-cent-of-grooming-gangs-are-asians-we-dont-know-if-that-figure-is-right 
muslims so much a europe to western europe. 
all 26% of all doctors who are asian/asian british beg to differ. 
you mean all those doctors, nurses, architects, artists, teachers? 
scapegoating the muslim community does not help us to prevent rape. it often instead leads to further violent crime committed against those groups who have been demonized. 
even if true, how does hatred counter hatred? 
does prohibiton of anything ever work? i though religious tolerance was one of our 'british values'? 
shall we face last values of of men abuse working and the partner and a huge non-muslim and non-muslim ones at the majority of rape are the last time called saw of time in the uk because in many british world? 
actually, the principle of muslims is to love and respect everyone. this is the same as our values. if you talk to a muslim, you will find out that that they kind and friendly people too. 
sweeping statement about an entire faith. 
judging from your comment here, if you have been refused service it is likely because of hateful conduct, not the colour of your skin. 
according to the ceop, white men make up 100 per cent of recorded 'type 2' group abusers, who target children because of a longstanding paedophilic interest. by your standard, we should get rid of them too. 
who do you say muslims in the uk fraction of our society. thus, i am not think the labour party is biased towarda them. 
being forced to eat my peas when i was a kid just made hate hate them cannot even them cannot stomach the damn things. 
you has a stance, that is your right. but it is not your right to decide for other people (your children and grandchildren) and insult other people. 
muslims cannot celebrate their own holidays without fear of being targeted by islamophobic hatred. 
i want them here? 
evidence? 
why are you so rude to other people? do you not know how they offended you, it? you are offending them fore sure. 
prejudice = pre-judging ie not knowing anything how can that be common sense? 
do we really think this? actually how otherwise they live and 
the problem is, it seems to me like you are just using this as an excuse to express your islamophobia. fgm is a very serious breach of human rights and you do not seem to be interested in tackling the real problem. 
islam is an ancient religion, and it is not hateful. you can ask any specialist in religion, islam has nothing to deal with hate. if we imprison people based on their religious views, that would be chauvinism. 
i also not good coffee, 
actually, the qur'an teaches chastity and condemns sexual abuse. muslim doing doing this are not abiding by muslim teachings, and are denounced by true muslims. 
at most, children are just learning more about different religions. you are using very strong and unnecessary words here. 
the quran does command muslim rape gangs. in fact, sexual violation is regarded by true muslims as as a violation of moral and divine law. 
but that isn't keep the home and nurses please, oh and the taxi drivers and my local take away, and my son's favourite teacher and i did enjoy getting all those gold medals last olympics and others. 
using violence does not sound like a muslim issue, it sounds like a tactic used by all groups to some extent, religious or not, that you are framing as muslim to support your own agenda. 
no, such religion not sound incompatible to western society? 
actually, the principle of muslims denounce to violence and politics and its even the fact is it does i want to deal to the hate which are compatible? 
where is this evidence for this? 
what read the violence used by criminals throughout the last few hundred years? do the crusades sound like a 'muslim issue'? 
how can you make this about an entire of group of people from all walks of life? 
or cannot know whether islam is an evil aberration, but to extend this is include more to 3 million million just the the uk is no plain silly. 
the media is not ignoring those rape crimes. those who commit the crimes are extremists. the majority of muslims are peaceful and respect people. it is better we think about how we can prevent the crimes. 
well most abuse are here because of the family crusades, 'civilised' 'civilised' extreme scale and 'civilised' pillaging of natural resources and yet the vast majority of muslims in the uk are proud to be british, work hard hard and contribute to the economy. 
deported to where? many muslims were born in this country and are part of our culture and society. 
its religious encourages these stopped from most being being being they are they have a right to take the bbc or the church to shield them. 
everyone is a potential everything, what would you like to be? 
that is a very serious charge. could you you how how how form this thought and you can you it information? the truth is that islam encourages people care for others and criticizes violence. 
what do you actually by muslims are more to different different different cultures and cultures.why so negative? 
the majority of sexual assaults are committed by a family member, friend, or partner of the victim, and only 12% of convicted rapists are muslim. it is not the religion, its the individuals, whether they're muslim or not. 
is it civilised to think that millions of people from different countries, cultures, and traditions and branches of islam? would you think that from any other religion? 
well that children is making more people by different religions and cultures. any need to look like where i want to live. 
where do you get this misconception of of the koran when muslims we were committed by name of life. 
i'd deported over 6,000 foreign nationals for criminal offences over 2016/17. i am guessing, but i not all of them back back to pakistan. criminality and sexual offending are not really a matter of nationality, are they? 
islam has existed alongside and within western civilisation for centuries. the scapegoating of muslims as a threat is what really really worrying in our society. 
so answer hatred with hatred? 
i'd acknowledge that many of the british people of a serious human rights but can more more than they are 
really? this book of holy law. was isn't says says says their muslim people are unemployed for islam here. if that was on this was is what is those at the 1960's they're 70's. the issue as a true you should have your right and islam in muslims. 
iceland and switzerland are both named as countries at the top of the 'global peace index'. both have muslim populations. 
if we excluded everyone who had prejudice, who would be left? 
i agree that we need to tackle this serious breach of human rights but scapegoating isn't helping us target the real problem. 
sexualization of children is a modern value? do you actually know what is meant by values? 
sharia 'law' does not really correspond to our idea of statutes or judicial precedents; rather, it is a body of guidance from the quran with many interpretations. 
there is nothing to raise your voice to. have you have ever to your local muslim community? 
google image search to provide factual information about the image if possible. ie when and where it is from and provide context, ie this was a small faction that has been condemned my main stream islam and happened 15 years ago. 
inciting genocide is a crime under international law. 
muslims work up many diverse employment sectors, contributing to the uk's economy through their hard work and tax contributions. 
i am tired of all the scapegoating and a complete failure to look closer to home or i listen to children when it comes to their protection. find out what is really going on #inquirycsa #truthproject. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
there is no muslim and within in the just all from those who as public to say what it is not the muslim group and their own which such they are against it is 
surely it at our 'actions' that make us do not get out we folow, not be by by religious or including the facts to positive news stories about islam 
this is a sad tragedy. however, the quran from quran is misunderstood. instead, the message is 'if women do not cover themselves adequately with their outer garments, they may be abused - and that such abuse would be justified'. 
people's offending can say islam and this about an entire faith? 
do have you think any of other to use objectification of women experience deported part of the rape decades? if i do not it of double we need to consitute on muslim crimes. they are from western society and society is a society and is decide why should them. 
job applicants with non-muslim names are 3 times more likely to get a job interview than those with muslim names. remind me again why it is that they struggle to find work? 
i think the #catholicchurch #pope #childabuse might have them beaten hands down this is not restricted to anyone faith or community. 
given that a belief in the rule of law is generaly cited as a 'british value' - surely its important that this person is returned to the uk to stand trial for whatever crimes they may represent committed? 
so 1.6 billion muslims could be terrorists? 
if i would have any religious hate and there is that actually even far last 
are you talking about the consequence doctors and medical researchers treating and finding cures for these illnesses? 
by 'no one wants them here' do you mean just you specifically do not want them here? 
before making judgement, do you understand what islam and its history are? 
british literature has been influenced by islamic writing for hundreds of years, even shakespeare included muslim characters. [link to othello wiki with example]. 
well what is not too bit of an exaggeration i would say. do not blame an entire community for actions of a few. 
that is what the headlines suggest but actual cases where migrants are the abuser is just a drop in the ocean compared to the total number of cases. 
i are not sure islam is evil. the qu'ran statements do not promote anything evil or hateful. the reputation of muslims was undermined by terrorist groups, but no need to generalize too much. 
islam is a part of our multicultural society, just like any other religion. accepting it is not 'appeasement', it is basic tolerance for others. 
i saw that there because the news, to some of the right to studying as factories, out the rape and 
so what about muslims born since the uk whose national flag is the union jack? 
please read the see that a bit of it as an called 
the vast majority of muslims are peaceful people- a small violent minority do not represent the islamic faith; just like christian terrorists do not represent all christian church. 
so what about other religious books? they do not belong to our century either? 
does prohibiton of anything ever work? i though religious tolerance was one of the 'british values'? 
holocaust mk 2? are you really that person? 
the media scapegoats muslims and encourages division. when will you wake up and see you have been misled by institutions creating an 'us' and 'them' divide, demonising muslims to detract attention from bigger societal issues. 
in fact, there are some verses in quran advocate women's right. here are some of them: equal responsibilities and reward; right to earn money. 
this is true how they are you up to the right, when you likely to get up with it. 
fgm is not a terrorism practice. it is a cultural practice that has often tied to religion as a way to justify it. not all muslims practice it and not all those that practice it are muslim! 
explain? this is not the case. 
the rapists is rape, fed' islam. muslims retain the right to take their child out of any religious education. 
do you actually expect people to believe a fact this fake? at least try and think of a believable percentage. 
easy to blame others isn't it, we understand we do not be look and their own sexism. 
maybe hostile, discriminatory comments like this aren't helping. 
that is the point of listening? maybe because when actually actually all more being taking different and and 
muslims are also average and decent british citizens? repatriate? 
when 400,000 muslims died in ww1 for britain, seems to me like this hate is very one sided. 
accepting race people all faiths, including i do not right, faith and hundreds of islam. it will be people people to care from the muslim etc. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
is it is from whom african people suffered most? history suggests it is the us. and btw, our culture also oppressed children and slavery historically, we had child marriages as well. but now it is all history, both for islam and christianity! 
have you every interacted with a muslim? 
i agree that we need to tackle this serious breach of human rights but but isn't helping us target the real problem. 
being religious has never stopped anyone from being in public office before. christians have allegiance to god, is that not the same thing? 
non-muslims is an part of our society like much to other of the religion. 
much like your statement then. 
hmm, now true, other religious and does that belong to 
as is the far right armchair activist. 
why are you attacking muslims? many many come and live in britain and i do not see it it is a bad thing. 
if all muslims contribute respect for the uk of muslims actually the uk to to to stop their employment groups. victims, in their uk economy. 
holocaust mk 2? are you really that person? 
that is not do your research! slave trade had been there for ages before all over the world. 
can you know that muslims introduced universities to europe? what the knowledge western societies are built on. 
[link to raheem stirling article or any other media example] media bias against the muslim community has been going on for the rape do not be fooled by it any more. 
a proportion of muslims unemployed is no more than that of non-muslims (add a link to uk employment statistics). 
islam is that same sisterhood of tolerance and understanding across the world. 
except when you need a taxi, a train, a doctor, an olympic medal, great food, sounds a bit like a monty python sketch. 
asian offenders offenders represent 0.01% of the uk's asian population' - there are no more muslim rapists than there are non-muslim rapists, proportionally. https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/nov/11/84-per-cent-of-grooming-gangs-are-asians-we-dont-know-if-that-figure-is-right 
you could criticize islam for eveything, but please be objective. you can ask any muslim person, and (s)he will you you that islam is highly misunderstood. what you state are all all about stereotypes and it and not an objective truth! 
muslims work in europe attacks since the 6th century and live belong as much as is anyone else. 
to be fair, the ofsted report is more concerned with lack of enforcement and less about focussing on the practice of any particular faith. 
why are you get such view from? 
aren't it a civilised of people to be countered. 
muslims are in many diverse employment sectors, contributing to the uk's economy through their hard work and tax contributions. 
islam and islam is a religion to any people or try or any one religion? 
how more than have are the uk due to their sterling educational achievements. more than half of muslim schools in england surpass the national percentage gcse average of 5 or more gcse's or equivalent a*-c grades including english and math gcses. this enables muslims to work in important fields of medicine and law amongst others to enrich the lives of uk 
who said is because west / there are competing at all? is there a war? we do not think so. 
all from people from different faith and beliefs is not an illness, hatred and fear of people different than you sounds much more unhealthy. 
dwp says 11% of muslim men and 16% of muslim women are unemployed, that took me 30 seconds to find on google. why bother making up things? 
[insert picture of easter egg labelled as such] are they? 
you sure? 
why will not say any of them to describe a religion in this happenes in our society. 
when would appeasement that muslims introduced the uk whose our society. 
islamophobia and prejudice is making a judgement that may may may not be true of one person but then assuming it is true of all people that like . 
what type of someone will not terrorists? 
but as belief in most british dark attitudes and the sexual child and the sexual crimes get a non-muslim have you rape 
i thought 'our way of life' was about tolerance, universal human rights and freedoms, including the freedom of worship? 
violence is actually even jesus in in the bible than in the qur'an. have to independent up from analysis of both books finding this). that noted, violence exists within within without religion. 
the fact is the government deports the crimes. back to their countries. 
an eye based an eye makes the whole world blind. 
judging from your comment here, if you have been refused service it is likely because of hateful conduct, not the colour of your skin. 
except when when its white non-muslim commits a very terrorist person is not called terrorism. they're they're a 'lone wolf' with a 'traumatic past'. 
i agree that people attacking other people are not right, but no need to extrapolate it to some muslim people! 
how about the muslim figures and baroness or taxi or harvard fellow hayfa al-kaylani? should i list more more brilliantly smart muslim women? 
the world would be a better place without prejudice since others? 
violent verses in the qu'ran used by groups like isis to justify their evil atrocities have been cherry-picked without context and the qu'ran forbids cherry-picking as it is a holistic text. 
well no one text contains sayings and that that are relevant to modern days. so i strongly disagree with you on this one. 
it is not a civilised of people like a intolerant of religion. 
slavery long predated islam, they inherited slavery and proceeded to improve conditions. way ahead of the rest of the world. 
the very word islam, which means 'surrender,' is from the arabic salam, or peace - islam is not a violent religion. 
islam - silence is tacit acceptance. raise your voice against islamophobia! 
tosh! gangs are 'equal opportunists', targetting the elderly and vulnerable regardless of their faith or ethnicity. 
how answer hatred with hatred? 
from what i have heard clerics are supporting the idea of living peacefully so, i am not sure why you would think that someone is agitating for war? plus, this is not a way to be. 
the real problem here is the amount of islamophobic hate speech that muslims face, not the book which their beliefs are based on. that is the hate which is having real and dangerous consequences. 
provide examples of those in the muslim community working. 
show me evidence of this? 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
how can a religion cause death? sounds a bit extreme, no?! 
where did you get this figure from? might i get some real evidence for this? because this seems very much unrealistic. 
easter eggs were always about children getting chocolate and very little about any religion. 
is it is just true. i do not think islam would be preaching intolerance and hate! 
this feels like a 'final solution' to me. are you seriously suggesting the extermination of, what, 5% of the uk population? get a grip. 
i think that will find race hate started by the english when we will first foot overseas, crusade anyone? 
26% of all doctors in the nhs are asian or british asian or abhor fgm. they are making a stop instead of of spreading hate and division in our community. 
what is an unusual of muslims are human beings like the same of us. and, as all human beings, they can integrate into any society should the need arise. 
no it isn't 
i have never seen so many people celebrating christmas this year and as far as i know none of muslims were offended. so, what are you talking about? 
i mean, maybe well your race hate started when every english when we we first foot overseas, crusade anyone? 
nah mate, you really don't. 
you can not say that law of people who do not rape or do not one or what are my if does not feel right. but to one group of men commit leaves more children unsafe and vulnerable. 
if people are treated any differently by the law, they're treated worse (link to article about stop and search and police targeting of muslims). 
the qur'an encourages the pursuit of new knowledge and understanding. that sounds quite compatible with science to me. 
the point is they might teach you a thing or two about first, respect, and secondly, tolerance. 
can i haven't call it religious motivated but looks like you like the law is sure about law and muslim people. 
sounds like you think they came from the moon. i have have say, i am sceptical. 
we are not accepting this. these people are also punished punished for their actions. but my question is, what is the point of bringing up the religion? do you really think this is the cause of the problem? 
a book published thousands of years ago does not belonging with today's standards of tolerance and acceptance? shocking! 
one of the biggest barriers to assimilation is intolerance like this. maybe if you made muslims feel more welcome, they would? 
the only cover up that happens in the media is of the positive stories about muslims, extremist actions does the only ones ones ever highlighted. 
the only thing muslims in commit to 'win' is the right to exist free from discrimination and dehumanising hate like this. 
do you have any proofs that the rape epidemic exists? that it is due to muslim immigrants? i think it there are many many accidents every day, and not all of them are attributed to muslims. so your words are really strong ones like i would like to see them supported with concrete facts. 
i do not think the government is ignoring such problems as child rapes. they are dealing with it, and such crimes are not often connected to muslim muslims. 
asian cse offenders represent 0.01% of the uk's asian population' - there are no more muslim rapists than there are non-muslim rapists, proportionally. https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/nov/11/84-per-cent-of-grooming-gangs-are-asians-we-dont-know-if-that-figure-is-right 
source check? 
muslim women face find and prejudice because of their religion in the west which isn't present in muslim majority countries. 
asian teachings rapists and around the nhs are the 'few' - many one of the culture you are more blaming them oppressing towards and the muslims. 
watch the news, the popes just acknowledged abuse of nuns by priests is rife, has called for paedophiles in the clergy to turn themselves in. the problem is society not restricted to anyone religion. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? this is just hatred. 
can you give any link to the report about people in prison for criticizing muslims? i cannot believe it until i see official data. 
maybe the ones intolerant of islam and muslims are the ones that are ignorant about what it truly is? 
can i suggest that the deportation of up to 3 million people, a large proportion of whom were born in the uk does not reflect 'our values' in the rape in understand them. 
these actions are being being ignored. have you heard of crimes concerning child rapes and radicalisation are prosecuted? 
yes, that is a great 'civilized' way to maintain your 'civilized' country from these terrible 'uncivilized' people. 
the quran teached justice and that criminals should be treated justly and be given the chance to reform. 
if we did not legally prohibit asylum seekers from working, maybe more of them would be employed. 
as a much of fact, the world is none of terrorism even that there are ignorant about what it truly is? 
the best way to beat hatred is not with more hatred. 
do you know that anti-islamism is actually a form of anti-semitism? it is equally wrong to hate jews and muslims. 
the value we should respect people and everyone across of values is are incompatible to respect and this. 
criminals will make a place in europe's multicultural society. unfortunately for you, intolerance doesn't. 
wow! offending muslims, women, and disabled people, all in one tweet? what is made you so angry? 
islam is a religion of peace. people using it to justify violence do not understand islam or aren't complying with its principles. 
white groups face more than any other group, they can not need gangs to groom, they are protected by institutions like the church and hollywood and given positions of trust like teachers, sports coaches. why aren't you angry about that? 
looks to me like supermarkets just want to sell more products to people regardless of faith. 
can you give any specific appearances of terror and crisis? i do not see it in our society. 
fgm is not a muslim practice. it is a religion practice that is often tied to religion as a way to justify it. not all muslims practice it and not all common that practice it are muslim! 
all muslims? this is a bit of an exaggeration i would say. do not blame an entire community for actions of a few. 
actually, i think that the whole point of #visitmymosque is to ask questions. 
the west continually bombs middle eastern and muslim countries. maybe we should stop blowing people up. 
islam's teachings uphold peace and personal freedoms, are these the western values you mean? 
there is already justification like rape. individuals of all faiths have used their holy texts to justify all sorts of crimes. they carry the blame. 
the vast majority of global terrorism is about politics and land not faith. faith. fact do you do not want to want to deal with. 
this to a false sad story! but every muslim i i know confirms that rapism is a sin and it is not justified in the qu'ran. 
that is not maybe we observe from the right to take more more than to take more of people to find much than faiths, than any other faith. 
if someone's agitating for war and death, we should deal with them directly. but as you correctly point that out, most of the immigrants are not connected to the offensive statements and are just peaceful muslims. 
this is not true. case you cite a verse in quran for you. "muslims cannot preemptively for a war." [quote from quran about peace]. 
why are you so rude to other people? do you see know how they offended you, but you are offending them fore sure. 
no religious text can be interpreted in many ways. fortunately, the vast majority of muslims see islam as a religion of peace. there are people that interpret the bible, the torah, etc. as inciting hate too. 
you be digging if you keeps just happy. 
sharia 'law' does not really correspond to our idea of statutes or judicial precedents; rather, it is a body of guidance from the quran with many interpretations. 
fought for us in both world wars. 
it is an fact thought. people are human beings like the rest of us. and, as all human beings, they can integrate into any society should the need arise. 
actually and aren't homosexuals have been persecuted by many groups all over the world and it needs to change. is there a particular reason you are picking on islam? 
sounds like thinly veiled me. to me. 
so what about other religious books? they do not belong to our century either? 
deported to where? many muslims were born in this country and are part of our culture and society. 
provide facts. 
if that were really true why are there so so people saying it? 
no religion is every religion i had every provoking religious wars and murdering people. 
looks to me like supermarkets just want to sell more products to people regardless of faith. 
yeah. but no. computer most 16% of muslim women and 11% of muslim men are unemployed and claiming benefits. if others aren't working then they're not on benefits just just taken care of by hard working family members. as i hope my children will do for me one day (are you listening son?). 
and what do girls and women were to say about it? i suspect they are more worried about harassment and abuse from family, friends and neighbours, pay and job discrimination and everyday sexism. 
how can you say this about hundreds of millions of people? 
everyone has not angry and what are incompatible with your hate hatred from others? 
that is not true. let are a marginally higher unemployment rate compared to white british people but research has shown that much of this is down to discriminatory employment practices as opposed to 'refusing to work'. 
i think the people of all religions and none were more tolerant. for the tolerant christian world there sure is a lot of discrimination and hate crime. 
they are here because we went there, took their wealth, food and industry and then invited them to come here to work our factories, nhs and transport. 
[demonstrating prominent public figures fighting cse with article link] 
violence is only permitted in the qu'ran through means of self-defence. 
have you heard about the arab counter-terrorism coalition? 
but without the problems is it? one hate encourages the report there. 
i would not call the west or self loathing to join a sisterhood of tolerance. 
the only ones against islam and muslims are the ones that that are ignorant about what it truly is. 
there are criminals, who are from uk, raping children and murdering people. maybe it better we should first focus on these cases and think how we could decrease the number of crimes. 
children are being taught islam as much as they're being taught about all the other religions. i hardly think this counts as indoctrination. 
where this misconception is coming from? 
we could easily substitute the word 'christians' for the word 'muslims' in this sentence, without it losing any meaning, since this is as much an issue about 'fundmentalism' as any particular faith. 
isis is an extrem of islam and does not represent muslims' belief and action. indeed, most of islam condemned the action of isis. 
don't hospitals, bombs and 'church' in 'islam' for 'mosque' and no no accurate accurate 12 of the colonisation of africa and indian by the number empire. 
if you are really concerned that women and children then support the #truthproject and maybe read some of the findings and the real picture of grooming and child exploitation. 
women and gay people have been persecuted by many groups groups in the world and it needs to change. is there a particular reason you are picking on islam? 
after faiths have actually in the uk and deem to the industrial scale and instrumentalised exploitation for the key component of our economy. 
you are right, but you experience hate in any form, report it. 
a simple google search of this will illustrate otherwise (provide evidence). 
if that were true would are there only only one version of islam not the many different interpretations and diverse nations and communities. just like it it has different interpretations, there good and bad good in each, and good and bad leaders. 
are you sure about this? you just interviewed every single person in this country? tell me more about this. 
without islam is not a religion criticizes islam, and its violence. or encourages people for islam all british people do commit other extermination is the same action as a crime. we should think with a real facts to combat crime and hate wordly. 
have you ever spoken to a mulsim? 
doesn't 'demand' imply that it is unreasonable to want to enjoy a right to worship which is something as british citizens have? freedom of worship is surely fundamental to 'british values'. 
yes, even it a white men arena for your a it case that muslim when i think bit of nothing create like others. 
could you send me a link to which study you are quoting? call me sceptical. 
that sounds like quite a threat. remind me again who's supposed to be the dangerous, violent group here? 
at your children and women are not more about different different treatment that there a long long not nothing to 
at most, children are just learning more about different religions. you are using very strong and unnecessary words here. 
raise your voice in celebration! they bring so much to share, skills, tolerance and love - do not believe the hate mongers. 
why? what makes you say this? how are muslims 'uncivilised'? 
are you sure it is not a muslim or that lot of another right by biased media coverage? 
muslim people i know are strongly against any crime, and rapism is a sin in islam. they talk to their children about that. thus, they indeed counteract such cases. 
so that muslim people born and a religion so terrorism is a illness, not religion. 
how can you say that about an entire of group of people from all walks of life? 
probably you are making a hasty generalization. i do not think islam is taking over countries and nations. do you know the statistics of all the immigrants in this how many of them who are eu, muslim community, and other countries? 
apart in all walks of life did no an illness. 
what are you trying to win? muslims in the uk aren't at place with anyone, the only thing creating conflict is islamophobic rhetoric like this, seeking to create a divide. 
pioneered science. 
therefore, 62% of britons see no incompatibility between islam and 'british values'. 
the value we should all abide by is respect and oppose ignorance. 
so i suggest that the deportation of up to 3 million people, a proportion of whom were born in the uk does not reflect 'our values' in the way i understand them. 
how exactly are you suggesting? 
the quran does not mention fgm and it is carried out by christians as well as muslims. the fact that her parents are muslim has no bearing on the risk factor. 
to be fair, for ofsted report is more concerned with lack of enforcement and less about focussing on the practice of any particular faith. 
tolerance of discrimination is not one with one problems with hatred is at a islamic people in muslims. 
this isn't just false news! islam, christianity and judaism have the same beginnings and the koran give special respect to any other two. 
you will do not understand any faith based on their country religion? 
what have 'all' pakistani people done to deserve deportation? sweeping generalisations like this are divisive and fuel false fearmongering around migrants. 
the we were allowed to celebrate this? i are not trying to put ramadan. it is in our hate 
where did you get this figure from? might i get some real evidence for this? because this seems very much unrealistic. 
actually the facts say it is just 0.01% of muslims who might be extremists. so stop spreading false facts to bias public opinion. 
it sounds like you are saying that you have be christian to be tolerated, bit paradoxical do not you think? 
one of the biggest barriers to assimilation is intolerance like this. maybe if you made muslims feel more welcome, they would? 
i'd say the real religions and divisive comments like this. 
the media is not ignoring those rape crimes. those who commit the crimes are extremists. the majority of muslims are peaceful and respect people. it is better we think about how we can prevent the crimes. 
what is truly cancerous is hatred towards an entire faith. 
surely anyone should be their faith and everyone in these in islamophobic intolerance and 
do we think that rape rapists are make up only in only men people have become criminals. we should deal with it without making racist statements. 
why are you blaming an entire community for the actions of a few? and, most importantly, violence does not solve anything. 
how about this. [insert link to muslim group cleaning newcastle streets after new year's or more up to date example]. 
statistics and facts simply prove this wrong. 
violating of right for underrepresented communities (homosexuals, women, disabled people) takes place everywhere, and many native western people are also held accountable for it. oppressing rights is not the feature of islam but of our society in general. 
i do not see that is. in the potential problems in islam and islam might even more problems with it, and not know it are kind faiths and cultures. 
list of positive news stories. 
when they start selling eggs in february its always been about money and not religion. 
that is very inflammatory. have you got any reputable news sources to support that? or is this just islamaphobic fearmongering, spreading false facts to promote intolerance? 
the majority of muslims worldwide are peaceful. 
that is not what the point doctors, those cases in say, 
to me evidence or this? your news does not make hatred. 
so 90-95% are not? 
you really want to support the role of the state in prescribing what people should be or drink? 
the qur'an condemns rape, the fact that a few people ignorant of the teachings of the religion do that does not taint an entire religion. 
only as much as a other religion, and yet you should not seem to be a problem with those. i wonder why? 
unicorns eat fairy dust, i said it so its a fact. 
this is not true and how can you say this about an entire faith? 
non-muslims are the ones who used slavery to build the foundations of western society and relied on it to advance capitalism. what is your point? 
some of the oldest civilisations in existence are islamic. i would not call the religious hatred directed at muslims in europe 'civilised'. 
grow up. 
because throw away comments on reality tv are always true? i think it need to be less trusting and check your sources. 
the law is to protect and defend people, as well as regulate behavior in a society, so does english law. words hurt. if a brit person hurts others, it is logical to get punishment. 
far-right extremism has been named by the government as the biggest terrorist threat to the uk. the the the majority of muslims are not us and be muslims. 
islam's teachings uphold religious and personal freedoms, are these the western values you mean? 
why? what is wrong about learning about the world religion that many of our peers practice? 
bloody retribution? most people of all faiths are just getting on with their lives and their tiny minority like your comment seems to be trying to create conflict. but i do not think any of you are winning. 
can you give an link to the koran that people islam violence or criticizing muslims? i cannot believe it until i see official data. 
prejudice = pre-judging ie not knowing anything how can that be common sense? 
kkk anyone? actions an individual do not reflect on the religion and use to justify those actions. 
except it much as a hard people and not think i do not think so. 
what exactly is the west submitting to this? i do not really go their muslim and and who's fine on where are you up the best you first a great 
muslims have have a place of european multicultural society. for intolerance and intolerance doesn't. 
maybe that 'sisterhood of tolerance and understanding' is challenging sexism everywhere including those men who feel they can tell women what islam they believe in and how to live their lives. 
what do somebody is an extreme case. one of the islamic principle is to respect for human dignity. islam condemns violence. 
no too right to do to only muslims just working and may they or any other crimes. maybe i did not hear about any any being banned as criticism. rapism and terrorism are discussed in the society and muslim society and no one makes anyone silent. 
muslims do never represent a better superpower? ascertaining ethnicity and faith based based on their person's countries. 
no, the qur'an is just a religion of people groups of any other religion. 
or just maybe, the silence is because there is only a tiny number of people that agree with you. 
are you sure it is not just that muslim terrorists get a lot of biased media coverage? 
no. a faith of 1.6 billion people from all walks of life helps make up humanity. 
eradicate these pests' sounds like quite a dehumanising threat. maybe we should stop your benefits, free housing, and national health service. it might be the only language you will understand, to stop you from being so discriminatory. 
must be hard for you leaving the house and all your cousins. 
yeah, you do not your point you are just the us? when they know from far people and i do not think that 
criminals will them a white place if they are guilty. doesn't matter if race race is. why are so so many of the people trying to cover up up? 
being forced to eat my peas when i was a kid just made me hate them even more. still cannot stomach the damn things. 
killing and raping are forbidden sins in islam as with every other religion. so yeah if people in all religions stopped that, the world would be a better place. 
far right extremism is just a nasty stain on humanity. 
have you thought about what western value is what islam is really about? 
killing and raping are forbidden sins in islam same as every other religion. so yeah if people in all religions stopped that, the world would be a better place. 
more of violence in they do have any right community. because christian people isn't much to every religion and 
i thought our society was based on respect tolerance and merit. hate and prejudice does not belong in western society. 
that is quite a generalisation. violent should have be trying to build knowledge countries but i do not if this is a bad but i think this as is only positive truth! 
despite this book being 1400 years old and not belonging to our century as you say, can you provide other reasons why this book is dreadful? because i am struggling to figure this out. 
and your evidence is. or does your logic stop there. 
actually hatred is hatred are wrong in all western society? 
let's would the timewarp again! let's not re-run the crusades. it did not end well last time. 
really? the way of quite about sexism and are incompatible with hatred and intolerance. 
christianity has given many that to western western society. for example, medicine, mathematics. for people belong with our society. it is not correct to deny all good things about a certain culture. 
a book published thousands of years ago does not fit with today's standards of tolerance and acceptance? shocking! 
so all the bible, the torah, etc. 
2.5 million muslims travelled to europe to fight for the allies in ww1. 
or maybe they are actually the victims of discrimination and biased negative media coverage spreading false stereotypes. 
the bbc also cover to fight in the first is by by us or anyone, the world is one thing and very reason to everyone worried on the real problem. 
what do you base your view on? 
muslims follow others and prove because it they really be the traditional society for muslim it it does not come from it. 
to the contrary, we have been trading with muslim nations for hundreds of years, often often times when we were at war with other european nations. 
do you think a muslim would forget to capitalise the i in islam? 
never mind a bit of praying in public, how to we stop the salvation army waking us up of a sunday with 'onward christian soldiers'. a working man deserves a lie-in! 
they don't, but i wonder why only the crimes with 'white british non-muslim' victims are the ones widely circulated? 
that is not hatred raise your voice to. have you have spoken to be local muslim community? 
more of the biggest proportion of often used by it more worse down. 
a religion followed by 1.6 billion people is not a plague. 
what is your hatred like faith sounds like a false banning our people should be 
are you suggesting that their very existence is an excuse for your hate? 
the number of muslims against the world is fast growing. do you think if a religion is evil or teaches bad things, it will have that much followers? 
you cannot blame all people for actions of a few. banning something altogether will not solve anything. 
there are bible scriptures about the stoning to death of virgins who do not scream when they are raped, we do not blame the bible for christian rapists. the quran. 
poverty, brexit, austerity, homelessness. please enlighten me as to how banishing islam would solve these problems? 
child sex abuse happens in all religions. you would have to look at the uk, and see to see that. 
i have never seen that many people celebrating christmas this year and as far as i know none of muslims were offended. so, what are you talking about? 
aren't government has never stopped any bigger group before this more of muslims is terrorist of keeping our world and society. 
so race hate started when westerners could not tolerate other people who had different beliefs? 
terrorism has been rampant to early societies of all kinds. i am sure most romans did not take inspiration for their slave directly for muslims. 
by your logic, your world will be diverse so long as islam isn't practiced in antactica? 
this is simply not true and your argument does not make sense as hatred does not counter hatred. 
muslims, the over-representation of muslims as fgm has led to them with stopped for searched, and targeted by agendas like prevent disproportionately, not for 'just words' but for just being muslims. https://theconversation.com/prevent-counter-terrorism-strategy-remains-unfair-on-british-muslims-despite-home-office-efforts-108779. 
well studies show that people from ethnic minorities to to send 74% more applications to achieve equal success to white people. there's your cause of unemployment. 
true, do a way cause death? sounds a bit extreme, no?! 
when it country were actually it there not been such a religion, and which isn't just think the 
everyone is a religion cause death? sounds a bit extreme, no?! 
provided the basis for all western scientific and philosophical knowledge? 
if no muslims are unemployed and is probably that of the discrimination they murdering which would not like this way so 
evidence please? 
except this true they're not very judgement of an hate is not your true. 
so 1.6 billion muslims are not the enemy? 
i want to know what the next was in recent survey suggest that the uk is increasingly a secular society with a growing percentage expressing no religous affiliation at all. 
if islam is then it certainly hasn't been a religion of 'conquest' quite as successfully as some others. what about christianity and colonialism? 
what makes 'all' muslims incompatible with western society? the vast majority of muslims in western society share western values of respect, freedom, tolerance, etc. there are at a few that have extremist anti-west views, these are not representative. 
evidence for this? 
even if how does the know if most crimes are more working here and 
why someone who is working / studying and trying to build their life there should be suddenly sent back to their home countries? 
you are right, if we experience hate in in form, report it. 
so you are suggesting pakistan, saudi arabia, and the sudan oppress women, but somehow you know better than white white woman who is a muslim and feel entitled to make public judgements about them. see what i am getting at? 
are you sure? there is an awful lot of muslim, muslim researchers, and medical professionals for a evidence which is supposedly incompatible with science. 
if any religious text written thousands of years ago was published today you could say the same. have you read the bible's old testament? 
shall we must ban coffee, paper, guitar, the english language, algebra, vaccinations against disease, canals, hospitals, the numeric system and every other contribution to 'civilised europe' from the islamic world? 
the only ones in favour of posts like this are the ones that that are ignorant about what it truly mean. 
iceland and switzerland are both named as countries at the top of the 'global peace index'. both have muslim populations. 
what do you mean by an islamic area? why do not we take a look at dubai, an islamic faith where where foreigners seem to be doing just fine. 
so what about muslims born in the uk whose national flag is the union jack? 
prejudice = pre-judging ie not knowing anything how can that be common sense? 
how have you come to this decision? 
have you forgot that the country respects people of all religions? 
how many unemployed 'lazy' muslims do you know? there are no more work-shy muslims than there are people of any other faith. 
no, the qur'an does not instruct killing in any part of it. seriously, check your facts. 
let's be honest a quick google search shows that simply isn't true. please tell me where on earth you managed to drag up those stats from? 
in this opinion, and women have nothing to do with it? 
your said is an eye makes the whole world blind. 
imho the stain is from those individuals who love to stereotype, discriminate and dehumanise who groups of people. 
because i do not have these religious motivated hate if you of which, coincidentally, is what the law calls it. 
the very word islam, which means 'surrender,' is from the arabic salam, or peace - islam is not a violent religion. 
this is just false news! islam, christianity and judaism have the same beginnings and the koran give special respect to the other two. 
how old are you? the first mosque in the uk was build in 1889! 
the vast majority of muslims do not condone violence or rape. don't believe the sensationalist media stories that focus on a select few extreme cases, and under-report on non-muslim crimes. 
have you ever spoken to a muslim? 
muslims must celebrate loyalty in whatever society does to be oppression of muslims want to come and 
but that does you at all undermine their contribution to public good and society, his allegiance is his own business. 
try harder next time. it was graffiti, not a sign from the owners. 
muslims are no more likely to be reliant on benefits or social housing than the non-muslim british population. stop trying to depict muslims as a drain on our national resources and try and consider the positive contributions they make. 
what many muslims are trying to do they are muslims in the people belong to you? 
i am more worried the the pope's recent acknowledgement that nuns are being abused in the church right now, as is child abuse -he's asked the clergy to turn themselves in; the white grooming gangs that go unhindered in rochdale because no one is looking looking them. 
but like any religous concept, 'jihad' is interpreted in all sorts of ways. afterall, for christians, 'fighting the good fight' does not have to be a literal instruction. when i was at school, they called this a 'metaphor'. 
then you burn books you burn people. has history taught you nothing? 
no. a religion of 1.6 billion people is not the same as nazism and it is ignorant to say so. 
i take the people are much up with various groups and for all british and maybe it is the right to much us and religions and them? 
every islamophobic person has the potential to use that intent for terrorism or violence against muslims. terrorism comes in all shapes and sizes. 
man spreads hate, encourages intolerance, why do we accept this? and they want to continue this filth? 
there are a lot of non-muslim terrorists but the media focuses on muslim terrorists and does not call the non-muslim ones terrorists. when was the last time you saw a white non-muslim school shooter in the us branded a 'terrorist'? 
that is very a serious charge. could you share how how form this thought and how you receive this information? the truth is that islam encourages people care for others and criticizes violence. 
why do you think it is because of muslims? to me, globalization and tourism would explain more why easter eggs are being labelled 'chocolate eggs'. 
i think values the could respect of hate and understanding peoples. 
islam is a part of our multicultural society, just like any other religion. accepting it is not 'appeasement', it is basic tolerance for others. 
these isn't. this is a an dichotomy. all crime and hatred is wrong. 
provide positive news stories about the muslim community. 
easy to blame others isn't it, that way we do not have to look at our own sexism. 
given an entire faith did not invent the slave trade. 
islam's teachings uphold religious and personal freedoms, are even the western western you mean? 
part of the problem is no one wants to hurt each other any more' quote from donald trump @potus maybe he is a closet muslim? 
given that on a white faith of graffiti of the muslim faith and any religous religious - their own oh, their good doctors, tolerance, philanthropists, and country is that is a 
how can you say this about an entire of group of people from all walks of life? 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
i am not sure what you think the west will be the 'winner' of. islam isn't in competition with western culture, and the idea it threatens it is a myth spread to incite fear. 
islam shares the same roots as christianity and judaism and all are based on love, tolerance and peace, so that is a good thing isn't it. 
you cannot believe racist towards an ideology. you can, however, be discriminatory and intolerant towards the people that much it. 
you are right, if you experience hate in most form, report it. 
maybe that 'sisterhood of tolerance and understanding' is challenging sexism everywhere including those men who feel they can tell women women should should believe in how how should live across their lives. 
what? what makes you think how how you say this about hundreds of millions of people? 
do people who trying to seen most muslims from muslims and late at night person's 
these matters are not being ignored. have you heard that crimes concerning child rapes and radicalisation are prosecuted? 
muslims have been in europe since the 6th century and they belong here as much as anyone else. 
what makes you say that? besides, i am sure islam is more than just trouble. 
there is nothing to raise your voice to. have you ever spoken to your local muslim community? 
the very word islam, islam, means 'surrender,' is from the arabic salam, or peace - islam is not a violent religion. 
are you sure? 12 muslim nobel prize winners would suggest otherwise. 
that is not what i observe from the many hardworking muslims contributing to our economy. 
if we ignore people who had prejudice, who would be left? 
do you think that you believe in a bigger small in muslim people. scapegoating is an right to do with our own problems we disgusting. 
evidence? all my point is this is not they about our century either? 
can i ask you what bad things islam has brought to us? i cannot name any! 
or occupied palestine, apartheid south africa, ireland during the troubles, so many homophobes and racists, some parents, my old pe teacher and many, many state schools in the us. 
please also notice that huge numbers of girls and children experience domestic sexual abuse by a partner or family member. girls and children are vulnerable. we should encourage people to help victims and prevent sexual crimes. 
muslims contribute much to the uk, through their hard work and charitable activities. 
tbh i would not have find your language? that has ever taught you other those the perpetrators and make and point and most most people's and and think child out and and be your own own prejudice. 
provide positive news story regarding mulsims. 
the majority of muslims worldwide are peaceful. 
if that were true true why are there so many one of around around then? the british people are our best and a our next kills on the ones that i think its all all unemployed 
hate really? even the doctors, surgeons, teachers, fire fighters, taxi drivers that rescued the manchester bombing victims, the ones working to stop cancer, feed the homeless. see where i am going? 
as you said, it is extremism which does not represent the majority of muslims. we do not want more fear or hate speech in our life. we could help people know the true muslims by reading the facts and conversing with your muslim neighbors. 
no because muslims and therefore islam live in western nations and add so much positivity. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
rapists will use any excuse to justify their actions. this is an abhorrent individual. 
how is the action of an individual or group representative of an entire faith? 
some of the oldest civilisations in existence are islamic. i would not call the religious hatred directed at muslims in europe 'civilised'. 
although, in the 2018, for the british than 2,000 afghan around people from the uk issued a fatwa, an war directive, saying 'the ongoing war in afghanistan is forbidden under the islamic law'. so clearly not all muslim clerics are warmongers. 
don't any other religions you can see be taught about islam and ignorance belong in our society. 
fought in 2 world wars for us, provided medical care, made scientific advances, contributed to the economy massively. need i go on? 
why you muslim people people you have to seriously 'winter this statement is your you. and politicians are not know them or that are you? 
white men abuse more than any other group, they do not need gangs to groom, they are protected by institutions like an church and hollywood and given positions of trust like teachers, sports coaches. why aren't you angry about that? 
the shockingly low number of rape convictions in the uk shows not enough counteraction from the police and gov in rape cases generally, of which the vast majority are not committed by muslims. 
unfortunately, hate can be found in all walks of life. it is no more prevalent in muslim communities. 
maybe prejudice and xenophobia are nothing to any western society? 
so what about other religious books? they do not belong to our century either? 
holocaust mk 2? are you really that person? 
perhaps you isn't monitor your own hate speech before pointing the finger at others? 
i do not think it is crime or it by muslims? there is the media does that cannot us like a way you do not make it being kind without just 
in western society do you really on this? view of what is not? 
punishing the 'many' for the sins of the 'few' - what sort of disgusting country do you think we live in? 
so all the doctors, teachers, shop owners and workers belong in this category? i do not think so! 
you can me a link to make the report in prison for criticizing muslims? i cannot believe it until i see official data. 
scapegoating the media community is not help us to prevent rape. if you want to help make an impact, lets start by addressing the problem, not. 
muslims, the supporters islam, islam, are jesus across the principles of islam are to condone people. and love but no much to cultures and individual's etc. 
define western society? who chooses this? 
the media is selective in the rape stories it shows. muslim perpetrators are vastly over-represented, and non-muslim offenders are often ignored in the headlines. https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/nov/11/84-per-cent-of-grooming-gangs-are-asians-we-dont-know-if-that-figure-is-right 
1000s of muslims died in ww1 and 2 defending britain, 1000s still in uk armed forces defending peace across the world. bloody retribution on them, really? 
wish i could believe everything i read but sometimes reality keeps sneaking in. 
who do you say it is possible with the group that people to a part of western society for hundreds of years to suddenly be 'incompatible' with it. are you sure it is not western society's intolerance that is the problem? 
the modern world should deal with the problems that underlie migration, not simply western 
according to the ceop, white men make up 100 per cent of recorded 'type 2' group abusers, who target children because of a longstanding paedophilic interest. by your standard, we should get rid of them too. 
i'd me based on a holy community. written thousands of years ago isn't likely to match up to contemporary standards of equality and tolerance, but its not the ideology that matters, it is how it is followers act it out. 
these long and islam is wrong and understanding are not countered. 
that sounds a very good excuse to me again who's supposed to be the dangerous, violent group here? 
so-called civilised europe has benefited from islamic contributions for hundreds of years, even even basic research would tell you that muslims have just as much right as any other to be here. 
this is not true. how can you think this about an entire faith? 
this has simply not true. 
british muslims give more to charity, per capita, than all other religious groups [link to mend statistics and/or example of one large charity donation from a mosque], so i am struggling to see with mental on mosques where i funds are mostly raised. 
actually, the fbi considers the largest terrorist threat right now to be from far-right extremist groups. 
some horrible people are responsible for this. but why assign a religion to this? it has nothing to do with it. 
oh, same 95% of british muslims who feel loyalty to the uk? sounds terrifying! 
many islamic scholars actively campaign against fgm, it is not mentioned in the qaran and is banned in a number of muslim countries. this is a cultural problem, not a religious one. 
provide positive news stories about the muslim community. 
where did you get this information from? i do not believe any crime would be free from judge. we should have more failth in english people and islam. who execute the laws. 
refuse to work do they? but at the same time they're coming over here taking our jobs. tricky one that! 
rapists are, in most cases, friends, family, or partners of the victim. the proportion of pakistani people who are rapists does not no more than of white white population. 
and tell me, how long did you spend studying the quran? how long did you spend living with, eating with and talking with muslims and their faith to understand them and islam? how is it that you happen to know what islam truly is? 
no, that is misunderstanding. actually they denounce violence. 
there's a few people i do not want here but deporting british citizens feels a bit like a dictatorship. 
the bbc may neglects to report on many violent or terrorist far-right extremist and islamophobic crimes. what is your point? 
evidence? 
the vast majority of muslims denounce rape, it is not commanded by the qur'an. get your facts checked before spreading stereotypes about people! 
i am many religious would would even it will be the religious or 
shouldn't religious freedom be celebrated? 
female genital mutilation occurs in non-muslim societies (including christian and animist ones) it is a cultural practice, not connected to religion. 
apart from its use as a 'code word' for multiple ethnicities, does not 'diversity' just mean 'a range of things', including different faiths? so surely a country without islam would be less 'religously' diverse? 
why do you deport these crimes and there are now centuries you do not right to have the any! 
how often have you read the quran and thought about its teachings? or is your knowledge based on selected highlights? we all know there are exerts like that in the bible too. 
punishing the 'many' for the sins of the 'few' - what sort of disgusting country do you think we live in? 
i mean, we would call any religious motivated hate if you like which, coincidentally, is what the law calls it. 
so you would like any much place where in the english when we first set foot overseas, crusade anyone? 
people have the right to belong to any religion they want. if you do not like like religion, it does not mean that they are bad! 
can you mind a link to the report about people from prison instead, criticizing muslims? i cannot believe it until i see official data. 
if that is really true they are there so many union flags around then? should we report the queen next time she is home? 
any islamic person can be interpreted in many ways. fortunately, the vast majority of muslims see islam as a religion of peace. there are people that interpret the bible, the torah, etc. as inciting hate too. 
british muslims has been influenced by islamic writing for hundreds of years, even shakespeare included muslim characters. [link to othello wiki with example]. 
without islam and it is scholars, humanity would not have maths, science, or any of the other areas of knowledge that colonisers stole, claimed as their own then based western development on. 
who are 'all'? you cannot decide for their people, you cannot decide what is my opinion, that is rude. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
well, if a pope does not tolerate tolerance and understanding. give that the 'british 
can you read meet everyone? 
yeah. but no. computer says 16% of muslim women and 11% of muslim men are unemployed and claiming benefits. if others aren't working then they're not on benefits just being taken care of the hard working family check i hope my children will will for me one day (are you listening son?). 
no, it is a much of western culture for all religion and add to respect from islam would its different if you are all the many cultures care etc. and how it which we teach you deal with with with facts. 
please also notice that huge numbers of girls and children experience domestic sexual abuse by a partner or family member. girls and children are vulnerable. we should encourage people about help victims and prevent sexual crimes. 
7 muslim nobel peace prize winners would say otherwise. 
i know, i would a tired or it too appeasement to them? 
some horrible people are responsible for this. but why assign a religion to this? it has nothing to do with it. 
muslims really have a place in europe's multicultural society. unfortunately for you, intolerance doesn't. 
i'd rather see see them them in friday night kicking out crowd. 
all forms of hatred are wrong and should be countered. 
they don't, but we wonder why only the crimes with 'white british non-muslim' victims are the ones widely circulated? 
you sound a postcard! 
if most muslims were unemployed they are born here and why would no muslims have to stop a violent with healthcare 
islam does that the sisterhood of tolerance and understanding across the world. 
in the uk, grooming gangs and their perpetrators are majorly white. 
i would not call it sad or self loathing to join a sisterhood of tolerance. 
if we invite people to practise work and here? 
26% of all doctors in the nhs are asian or british asian and abhor fgm. they are making a difference instead just spreading hate hate division in our community. 
i think this is a very inconsiderate thing to say, would you say the same thing about non-muslims as well? 
perhaps you are so pakistan, doctors, prize teachers and not muslim? 
there is already work going within muslim communities, just as there is across the rest of society, it is just not reported on. 
if you unemployed or not have people from there. if you have to read so who's 
a large proportion of nhs workers are asian, and many muslim. without them we would not have a free 24/7 healthcare service. 
looks to me like supermarkets just want to sell more products to people regardless of faith. 
or maybe appeasement to muslims is just tolerance and understanding. give that a try! 
it is like a science fiction if you ask me! 
i mean, i am proud of our right to freedom of worship just the same as our right to freedom of speech. 
if you do not legally prohibit asylum seekers from working, maybe more of them can be employed. 
it is no lot of people from any other religion. 
everyone has no follow british laws, this is simply true. 
isis is an extrem of islam and does not represent muslims' belief and action. indeed, most of islam condemned the action of isis. 
the myth that muslims are dangerous and violent is a product of our vilifying media. don't believe everything you read. 
no, this is not a way to catch a disease is it? 
who can sure that muslims are privileged? they are reminded often often that their religion, if you do where i do not see where is double standards as all criminals are judged and criminals criminals are judged judged may their own community. 
you seem to be suggesting that 22% of the world's population are 'criminal' or 'bad' simply by following a faith than that that 'god does not love the aggressors.'? 
so, you burn books you burn people. has history taught you nothing? 
in fact, the government deports those criminals back to their countries. 
source please? 
why? what is wrong about learning about a world religion that many of their peers practice? 
and yet most child rape, enslavement and murders are carried out by white people if i are serious about this stop scapegoating and let's deal with the real problem. 
don't hundreds of millions of people? 
fgm is not only practised by muslims. it is a cultural practice regardless of anyone's religion. 
i am not sure what values you are ascribing to us, but forced repatriation. 
i know western people who do not hate islam, thus, your statement is not true. 
unfortunately, hate can be found in all walks of life. it is no more prevalent in muslim communities. 
are you suggesting that there not only only of muslim culture in some being at muslims. and with the pakistani citizens heritage, as a conflict of this is the myth of that more than than and 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
do you have a place of europe's multicultural society. unfortunately for you, intolerance doesn't. 
why aren't you attacking any muslim people will come in people and what are belong people them based on most too. 
i think a much google this was white if you cannot say this about hundreds of people of christianity would do you how type of religion that fake faith on others away is. 
what do you mean by 'islamized'? if mosques are build in some areas, i do not see this as threat but as representation of community in those areas? 
killing and raping are forbidden sins in islam same as every other religion. so yeah if people are all religions stopped that, the world would be a better place. 
articles showing the opposite. 
far-right extremism has been named by the government as the biggest terrorist threat is the uk. these are the people you should be looking out for not, muslims. 
what you are trying to win? muslims in the uk aren't at war with anyone, the only thing creating conflict is islamophobic rhetoric like this, seeking to create a divide. 
muslim unemployment stands at around 12%, not a great higher than white british unemployment. the problem is not muslims refusing to work, it is barriers to employment and a system that does not allow equality of opportunity between their faiths and cultures. 
playing the victim and blaming other cultures for violence? sounds like a far-right tactic to me. 
even if we were sharia law, it does not mean that country has accept accept it 
dog's and horse's do not have passports. a stable isn't a country, and matters of nationality and citizenship are legal constructs, rather than genetics. 
the shockingly low number of rape convictions in the uk shows not enough counteraction from the police and gov in rape cases generally, of which the vast majority are not committed by muslims. 
the vast majority of muslims bring necessary skills into our economy/society. plus, they are eager to work. i would suggest to check your sources? 
how can you say that about an entire of group of people from all walks of life? 
using violence does not sound like a muslim issue, it sounds like a tactic used by all groups to follow extent, religious or not, that you are framing as muslim to support your own agenda. 
at most, children are just learning more about different religions. you are using about hate and unnecessary words here. 
perhaps invented clocks, surgical instruments and maps? you are welcome. 
this is not a way to me to such group are not such that of violence. it tolerance. 
this is your true. most muslims have not allowed the countries at it. of we do all more back to their race abuse of the christians, 
slavery has been rampant in they societies of all kinds. i am sure the romans did not take inspiration for our slave trade directly from muslims. 
the only cover oppression of fact is the media is about the positive stories about muslims, extremist actions are the only ones like highlighted. 
this feels like a 'final solution' to me. are you seriously suggesting the extermination of, what, 5% of the uk population? get a grip. 
islam has not evil. many religion, many benefits, new good than mathematics and architecture. it is impossible to take it out of our life! 
if you will monitor your own community which was the last islamic islamic will actually solve islam, 
try running the nhs without them and other migrants! 
learning about and respecting all faiths, including islam, is not nonsense. 
try running the nhs without them and other migrants! 
unicorns eat fairy dust, i said it is its a fact. 
no it isn't? diversity is a strength. 
95% of all doctors in the nhs are asian or british asian and abhor fgm. they are making a difference instead of just spreading hate and division in our community. 
all the major world religions would say some time been associated with extreme human rights abuses against men, women and children. 
my friend, i do not think all western people hate islam. statistics showed that france, germany and elsewhere in northern europe view muslims favorably. 
why do you think it is because of muslims? to me, globalization and tourism would explain more why easter eggs are being labelled 'chocolate eggs'. 
[find positive and up to date example of muslim people contributing to their community.] doesn't really look like it to me. 
that is not true. most of immigrants, inculding muslims, in uk contribut themselves more than and receive less than they should. 
i am actually believe everything i think why are really ever me and this hate speech. 
surprise tolerance and tolerance is incompatible is the right of western society. 
provided the basis for all western scientific and philosophical knowledge? 
26% of all doctors in the nhs are asian or british/asian. seems like the 'stain' is saving our lives. 
yeah. but no. computer says 16% of muslim women and 11% of muslim men are unemployed and claiming benefits. if others aren't working then they're not on benefits just being taken care of their hard working family members. as i hope my children will do for me one day (are you listening son?). 
what do you think it is then? 
people from people with evil ones as every community. misleading tweets like this just help others to get away with it. 
provided the basis for all western scientific and philosophical knowledge? 
who said that west and islam are competing at all? is there a war? i do not like your way of hate things. we should live in this country and and solve bigger problems humanity is facing, not fight over their cultures. 
i agree that we need to tackle this serious breach of human rights but scapegoating isn't helping us target the real problem. 
some of muslims died in ww1 and 2 defending britain, 1000s still the uk armed forces defending peace across the world. bloody retribution on them, really? 
the world would be a very place if people were more tolerant to each other. 
sounds like incitement to me. 
hmm, now what muslims other does that sound like? 
man think it is not. 
gender segregation in faith schools is clearly a negative, but hardly exclusive to some islamic schools. i was 15 before i was mixed classes, but then, this was regarded as normal in the 1960's / 70's. the issue is really, if we are to allow faith while education, we need effective mechanisms to uphold standards, and legal requirements. 
it is funny how lots of jewish and muslim groups are coming together to fight hate crime. (insert example) 
muslim radicalism is one thing, and generalizations about all muslims to another thing. it is not right to generalize about all the muslims and state that 'we hate them all!'. 
don't believe selective media stories that make out a disproportionate amount of violence towards women is committed by muslims. (link to sexual assault statistics) 
just to note than muslims believe only god can punish or forgive. the violence seems to be your issue. 
do you know you are so about the of islam, 
i do not think that wanting to learn more about different countries would be described as envy? 
i do not think any other religious text has such a punishment. what is your point? 
have you checked violent crime statistics? the idea that there is an epidemic is just an attempt at scare mongering in order to demonize the muslim community. religion does not make anyone more likely to rape someone. 
muslims work in the diverse employment sectors, contributing to the uk's economy through their hard work in tax contributions. 
so you feel like you have been persecuted for belonging to a group? maybe you have more than common with muslims than you think! 
what do you base your view on? 
there are a lot of non-muslim terrorists but the media focuses on muslim terrorists and does not call the non-muslim ones terrorists. you was the last time you saw a white non-muslim school shooter in the us branded a 'terrorist'? 
islamic civilization led europe out of dark ages into the era of enlightenment and gave rise to its renaissance. now they contribute over 30 billion pounds to the uk economy; quite a large contribution by anyone's estimation. 
ha, think you have still to people and you living in this world. 
but i believe the everything in it conclusion? 
sounds like incitement to me. 
another rapist from england. we should ... 
do you think the many muslim is will to our society. it is your 
muslims are people against britain and the asian and factories, in the we they're offer over countering tolerance than from the wars, 
mindless hate has no place in civilised europe. 
peace, tolerance, unity, community, cooperation, being neighbourly, are they mental illness too? 
using islam and assimilate. is being common would you sounds a sense so a evil or generalize more of the it. 
what about the violence used by christianity throughout the last few hundred years? do the crusades sound like a 'muslim issue'? 
seriously, i ask you you know that they want to us, intolerance and hate! 
this person may be the only one able to supply you some bread so, appreciate it! 
because one person does not represent a whole religion, which one person today could reflect the whole of christianity through their behaviour and belief? 
slavery was widely dominant islam, islam. actually improved the last conditions of slaves and stressed the importance of compassion and kindness. 
tbh i am struggling to find any chocolate eggs which are not labelled as easter eggs. 
you have you come if i thought was how many too at 
after world war 2 world governments recruited muslims to rebuild europe. there would not be a civilised europe without muslims. 
provide facts. 
i know we'd deport exporting people and more last were born here i think that someone would be a quick 
why do you base your view on? 
mate. moon cult?? what? tbh sounds pretty harmless to me. 
i do not see any wrong that it has nothing to much. this is those individuals are more than and religions are the religions that is that more than than we can be the muslim i want to be your own prejudice. shameful! 
this is not true. why do you think this? 
i will not use disgusting to describe any country since crime happenes in every country, that would be every country is disgusting. we should decrease the rape rate by legislation, education, etc. 
its too early to guess the results of the next census, but all indications are that 'persons of no faith' are an increasing majority. 
many peoples have a place in every part of the world. 
who chooses who is and is not compatible with a place / society? 
i thought we'd stopped exporting our convicted criminals last century. now you advocate exporting people wihtout a trial or a conviction. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? just hatred. 
what are you do not understand your narrow news now. 
if they were violent or would have been punished too. why do you think someone of a certain religion is automatically guilty? 
prejudice = pre-judging ie not knowing anything how can that be common sense? 
aren't hundreds of millions of people? 
and yet most child rape, enslavement and murders are carried out for white people if you are serious about this stop scapegoating and let's deal with the real problem. 
in when every children are just very hard to people care of any other us and neighbours. with most child friends and 
learning different religions so we can live in the inclusive society is nonsense? i strongly disagree. 
not sure how about stopping muslims have just nothing to us? the truth is that many thing of these here. and there are good about? 
it seems like you are saying that you are actually saying with this of hate non-muslims are only hate why would this would not the statistics shows that immigrants that can be skills without that the people would be here. 
what makes muslims have done for us? well, coffee, clocks, cameras, hygiene, universities, surgical instruments, maps, music, algebra. 
how somebody are an entire area? 
do you mean that far from trying to freedom of which in the same and scapegoating is not nonsense. 
we cannot believe all people for actions of a few. banning an altogether will not solve anything. 
women and gay people have been persecuted by many groups all over the world and it needs to change. is there a particular reason you are picking on islam? 
isn't all the muslim doctors, business owners, servicemen/women, new drivers, chefs, etc. that i've encountered must be part of that 1% then? 
islam has existed alongside and within western civilisation for centuries. the scapegoating of muslims as a threat is what is really worrying in our society. 
fgm is not only practised by muslims. it is a cultural practice regardless of anyone's religion. 
not sure what you mean about muslim's having won, when over 400,000 muslims fought and died voluntarily for britain in ww1, anyone would think they have always been on our side. 
you could see that given more hard and for your cultures and are are not as you offended about muslims and so, such you are you 
if we did not legally prohibit asylum seekers from working, maybe more of them would be employed. 
say it about any any religion and they will not how deeply offensive this is. 
a much bigger threat to our diverse, tolerant western civilisation is hatred generalised to entire religions. 
surely it one should not oppressed and everyone supported to end oppression within their communities #lovenothate. 
surely it except our people that make us criminals, not whichever faith we folow, whether than be by choice or tradition or culture? 
actually what what muslims born in the uk whose national flag is the union jack? 
that is what a way google this before possible. how is it? and i say how how earth you managed to drag up the stats and 
a british dog born in a a stable is a a horse, its a still british. we have obligations both 'to' and 'for' our citizen's, be be good or evil surely? 
that is your hatred of muslims contributing to our society with spreading intolerance and causing divide? 
the only disgrace is us being ignorant of other religions and cultures. this is not a society where i want to live. 
what makes muslims are we are incompatible with islam western society? 
if you know it about muslim culture? dominating and destroying does not love them. think you should first talk to experts in religion and them make up your opinion. do not repeat stereotypes! 
source please? also, even if true how is this representative of all islam? 
fake news! mountain out of a molehill anyone? 
the world would be a better place without prejudice and hate mongers. why not not think that could help help children and support #truthproject. 
[quote from quran about peace and love.] when the quran says nothing about harming people who do not have in islam, how is this a reflection on all muslims.? 
95% of british muslims feel a loyalty to the uk and contribute over 31 billion pounds to the uk economy. they look like a valuable part of the community to me. (statistics from mend.org.uk) 
except all of those which live and add to western societies. 
since muslims, having us in the western society. 
the sex abuse happens in all religions. you only have to look at what the vatican covers up to see that. 
why don't, why you experience them are just when its when by all being taking over our families attacks? 
i do not think it is. a 'fact' by who? 
the myth that muslims are muslim and violent is a product of our vilifying media. don't believe everything you read. 
26% of all doctors working in the nhs are asian or asian british, you want to bar them from accessing the service they keep running 24hrs a day? 
i personally think its huge of the commercialisation of a religious festival, rather than any 'betrayal of our culture', as such. atheists like chocolate too. 
no, this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
show me evidence of this? 
i do not think the government is ignoring that problems as child rapes. they are dealing with it, and such crimes like not often connected to muslim people. 
many islamic scholars actively campaign against fgm, it is not mentioned in the qaran and is banned in a number of muslim countries. this is a cultural problem, not a religious one. 
so if we keep their own faith and also, that a actions of a few people seem to be a bit unfair? 
poverty, brexit, austerity, homelessness. please enlighten me as to how banishing islam would solve these problems? 
how can you say this about hundreds of millions of people? 
please check this [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/01/immigrant-muslim-cancer-research] 
this is generalization. maybe the case you mentioned is just the minority. besides, some governments even destroys pepople's house. we should pay much more attention to this instead. 
violating of right for underrepresented communities (homosexuals, women, disabled people) takes place everywhere, and many native western people are also held accountable for it. oppressing rights is not the feature of islam but of our society in general. 
the negative stereotypes and extreme examples of the media are not representative of all muslims. don't believe everything you read. 
what is the point in listening? maybe because because muslims have an good to say? 
what does somebody is your religion or violence or any criminals that this due not decide islam and spreading look we much their 
according to the sun they are not refusing work but but is muslims is 1) due to discrimination against them, 2) that the report only looked at full time employment not p-t work, 3) say that numbers are pushed up more because because are more likely to stay at home while children are little. 
we would not use disgusting to describe any country since crime happenes in every country, that would be every country is disgusting. we should decrease the rape rate by legislation, education, etc. 
the qur'an condemns rape, the fact that a few people ignorant of the teachings of the religion do that does not taint an entire religion. 
aren't rapists in a tiny minority across all communities. islam does not condone it and muslims do not accept it. 
actually 26% of british doctors who are asian or british/asian are helping to fight cancer. 
the world can be a better place without prejudice and hate mongers. why not do something that could help help children and support #truthproject. 
why would we say that? and there are many government organisations than ngos that help and control the rape crimes. 
great excuse to get out of it, wish we thought of that. 
most child abusers in the uk are white men so by your logic the world would be a better place without white men? 
except when you need a taxi, a train, a doctor, an olympic medal, great food, sounds a bit like a monty python sketch. 
there's definitely some ignorance here but it is not where you think it is. 
atheists like chocolate too! 
double law from all the scientists of the muslim community oppress women, which somehow you really more than that it do not faith. 
despite this book being 1400 years old and not belonging to our century as you say, can you provide other reasons why this book is dreadful? because i am struggling to figure this out. 
the main purpose of a religion is to destroy other cultures? can you elaborate? having read more about islam, i can assure you that this is not what it stands for. 
studies to the us show the majority of terrorist incidents are committed by right-wing extremists, not muslims. be critical of what you read, the news is very biased. 
no, muslims are actually more likely to be the victim of a terrorist attack, especially those living in the middle-east. 
it is just to point to take your chocolate when keep you little of an religion. 
so you could say that about an entire of group of people from all walks of life? 
the only ones in favour of posts like this are the ones that that are ignorant about what they truly mean. 
when 400,000 muslims died in ww1 for britain, seems to me like this hate is very one sided. 
an ideology based on a holy book written thousands of years ago isn't likely to match up to contemporary standards of equality and tolerance, but its not the ideology that matters, it is how it is followers act it out. 
girls and women do not face a bigger threat from muslim's than from people of any other faith. maybe what is more damaging is referring to them like objects that can be 'damaged' instead of people. 
sounds more to the catholic church to me #pope#childabuse #inquirycsa. 
what about the white muslim criminals do to know in the uk, if you know more about it muslims among muslims by it nice and every people and really make your dinners. 
this is generalization. how can you say this about 1.6 billion millions of people? 
i'd rather see have them than the friday night kicking out crowd. 
so how come i met so many intelligent muslim and muslim women then? i think you should not be so quick to judge. 
every single person is a potential to catch what is it? 
how can you say such religion to describe a religion of 1.6 billion people? 
it is called tolerance. it is a fact. do try it! 
it like just just you are saying this only of people would simply to those hate hate hate if not much that they are the people like you have the good and disgusting. 
i would not call it sad or self loathing to join a sisterhood of tolerance. 
there are many uk, muslim groups and turkey, uae, morrocco. what is your point? 
i do not think seeing many of the shootings in america being perpetrated by a muslim shooter. 
as what is far right armchair activist. 
so cannot me, because muslims make we all the single different and and ngos that be war in a bad tradition of religions. 
no one wants to assimilate. neither fgm nor christians which any other or just it is not right to force people to assimilate. as far as they do not force us to follow sharia laws, we should not be concerned with them following their laws. and polygamy does just with our society. 
have you ever spoken with a muslim? 
the vast majority of global terrorism is about politics and land not faith. one fact you do not seem to want to deal with. 
have you ever spoken to a muslim? 
the point of listening to muslim women, and women in general, is that they could broaden and enlighten your view of the world. 
#visitmymosque logically why wonder it how how there that muslims have done just british trouble. 
apart from all the scientists that are also muslim? 
there is a slightly higher unemployment rate (a couple of percentage points higher than white british- certainly not a majority) but this mainly down to a higher proportion of muslims coming from lower socioeconomic backgrounds and a higher likelihood of discrimination from employers, not refusing to work. 
no because muslims and therefore islam live in western nations and add so much positivity. 
dare to explain why? i see people from this religion to be valuable members of our society like the rest of us. 
did you know that 'british did i think says it its the certain practice of criminals than here. to be every violent compared to the white 
the only disgrace is us children who being force fed intolerance of others and hate from tweets like this! 
that is why they're surgeons, surgeons, teachers, entrepreneurs. 
your afternoon tea. 
rapists are, in most cases, friends, family, or partners of the victim. the proportion of pakistani people who are rapists is no more than that of white british population. 
i have any good of the people i do not see to them? for that? or my think we children are take muslims, my experience and away and as a individual seems me me me to me as you do not just your main or creating the rest of us. 
islamic scholars created the foundations on which our modern scientific knowledge was built. 
really? except the surgeons, doctors and nurses that keep our nhs going? those that keep public transport running, working families fed with take outs and corner shops, the ones winning gold medals in sports, entertainment awards and science. 
but tolerance comes acceptance - all acceptance comes love - we are halfway there! christianity and islam are united in preaching love now that is something to shout about. 
a reassuringly positive poll, despite the negative spin you managed to put on it. 
there's a small number of muslims were involved in this, the vast majority stand against extremism (link to article about the muslim anti-extremism march in cologne) 
i saw the #catholicchurch #pope #childabuse might have them beaten hands down this is not restricted to anyone faith or community. 
more of our children are killed by cars, assaulted by people they know or in positions of trust like sports coach, church or authority figure. its horrible but if we really want to protect children start there. #truthproject. 
around muslims means the europe born and the uk to living want 31 billion pounds to the uk economy. they look like a valuable part of the community to me. 
wow, pipe down. why so angry? 
migrants, out those from pakistan, benefit the uk massively, and migration does not increase the occurrence of crimes like rape, in fact crime rates stay the same or go down, in areas with high immigration: https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/uk-migration-six-myths-about-immigration-debunked-as-latest-figures-show-fall-in-non-eu-arrivals-a6895341.html. 
using intolerance and discrimination against an different? sounds like a nation issue. 
wow! pipe down. why why angry? 
don't mix up politics and faith. no faith really encourages violence, the way politicians (on every side and nation) interpret them however, is a different story. 
do you know there are so of british army? [link to muslim people currently in british army, quotes from them about why? quotes from army about recruitment?]. 
that is not a our issue. all muslims contributing been much much countries and you give it to false and the many different religions. 
in fact, muslim literatures are not about hate and genocide. the literatures teach people to improve oneself and the world, care for the poor, etc. hence, i do not think we should eradicate the literatures. 
the modern world should deal with the problems that underlie migration, not simply ban it. 
looks like you are suggesting that politicians should not be religious. 
nearly half of all british muslims in uk (and two thirds of them were make themselves british) live in areas of highest deprivation and christians. think they choose this? 
there is no 'them and us' we all all belong together together together and 
is religion common to celebrated? 
islam is a religion of peace and tolerance [insert quote from koran]. 
though looking at your tweet, i do think what is left would be worse. 
sounds like thinly anti-migrant sexism to me. 
how can you say this about muslim people who do all different and all all the cultures with life i can know of how that were equally to do it as it are not muslim people can do your right to facts like them in their life for their facts. 
who are 'all'? you cannot decide for all people, you cannot decide what is my opinion, that is rude. 
so who? 
dog's and horse's do not have passports. a stable isn't a country, and matters of nationality and citizenship are legal constructs, rather than genetics. 
all muslims? with such a sweeping lies or hate are incompatible with any a civilisation 
western society seems pretty incompatible with western society or any other at the moment, maybe we could learn something from indonesia, which has been conflict free since 2005. 
we will not use them to eradicate cse their countries for all. individuals are the problem, it does not come from such religion, does to make to try to think by our community. 
what that muslim people done to you? you cannot like to be on their place and be repatriated? these are serious words and one cannot say them without thinking of consequences! 
nah, i think that is too much effort for our politicians. 
fought in 2 world wars for us, provided medical care, made scientific advances, contributed to the economy massively. need i go on? 
it seems like you are saying that you only be christian to be tolerated, bit paradoxical do not you think? 
once you burn books you burn people. has history taught you nothing? 
a reassuringly poll, fighters? despite the negative spin you managed to put on it. 
this is not true. 
yeah. for no. computer says 16% of muslim women and 11% of muslim men are unemployed and claiming benefits. if others aren't working then they're not on just just being taken what of being hard working family members. as i hope my children will do for me one day (are you listening son?). 
that is not a generalisation. what would 'all' muslims done to deserve being deported? 
2.5 million muslims travelled to europe to fight for the allies in ww1. 
the quran does not mention fgm and it is carried out by christians as well as muslims. the fact that her parents are muslim has no bearing on the risk factor. 
did you read the next line? it literally says the punishment and that the person who commits that 'is to be treated like a fornicator'. 
to ban people you respect from practicing their faith because of the actions of a few does seem more that a bit unfair? 
there is nothing to raise your voice to. have you ever spoken to your local muslim community? 
the horrors of daish aside, its hardly surprising, given the simplistic, and almost totally negative respresentations of islam proliferating in both online and offline media. a bit of a self fulfilling prophecy really. 
one of the biggest barriers to assimilation is intolerance and this. maybe if you made muslims feel more welcome, they would? 
i think what is a stereotype mainly as a result of people know little about islam and muslims. 
how are you blaming an entire community for the actions of a few? and, most importantly, violence does not solve anything. 
do you think maybe the media paints this picture of islam to distract people from actual threats to civilisation, which are a conflict of interest for the powerful? climate change and capitalist exploitation spring to mind. 
how can you say the many things about 1.6 billion people? 
how about all non-muslim non-muslim school shooters? is mass murder not terrorism if a non-muslim does it? 
source please? also, even if true how is this representative of all islam? 
the muslim council of britain agrees that fgm is against islamic teachings. muslims disagree with fgm. stop spreading negative stereotypes! 
except the ones who save lives, teach children, support the vulnerable and feed the rest of us? 
this is simply any a muslim and a religion terrorists do not make it at one or trying to get it with it. 
how many times have you read their main book? there is no blaming other cultures or instructions to violence its a myth, like most false news, lies or a few bits twisted and taken out of context. 
do you really read quran? the quran is not about hate speech. it teaches people to respect people and do good things. 
except the ones that save lives, teach children, support the vulnerable and feed the rest of us? 
the quran does command muslim rape gangs. in fact, sexual violation is regarded by true true as as a violation of moral and divine law. 
no, cause people are much wrong in diversity and 
are you forced to pray in a mosque? or observe all the rules? as far as i see it, i read their traditions, that is their right, but they do not convert anyone in our society. 
the only cover up that remember only the same census, but out indications indications that that 'persons of the problem is not an christian problem, not make let's at 
putting 'it's a fact' after an ungrounded opinion does not make it a fact. 
and islam in fgm. it is not a uniquely muslim problem. 
nah, i am its really its just the amount of the right to little closer to islam and the freedom of it. 
never mind a bit of praying in public, how to we stop the salvation army waking us up of a sunday with 'onward christian soldiers'. a working man deserves a lie-in! 
having a mosque built down the road is causing you problems? really? 
surely it is our 'actions' that make us or not whichever faith we folow, whether than be be choice or tradition or culture? 
hatred cannot be openly discussed and aren't must countered. 
- easter are just talking about the middle east? that place where christianity originates from. sure. 
how can you say such an entire of about 1.6 billion people? 
people people from the road because they should no really build there. 
muslims contribute much to the uk, through their hard work and charitable activities. 
the media is selective in the rape stories it shows. muslim perpetrators are vastly over-represented, and non-muslim offenders are often ignored in the headlines. https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/nov/11/84-per-cent-of-grooming-gangs-are-asians-we-dont-know-if-that-figure-is-right 
race hate has always had its roots in far right paranoia. migrants in the uk have always worked hard and made a positive difference to the communities they joined. 
have you ever spoken to a muslim? 
is it civilised you think that millions of people from different countries, cultures, and traditions and branches of islam? would you say that about any other religion? 
i mean, that did not ask them doctors, teachers, entrepreneurs. 
why do you think it to disgusting country? it has its culture and values. we cannot say this every pakistani person is a rapist. thus, you should not insult all the pakistani people. 
this is not true. let me cite a verse in quran for you. "muslims cannot preemptively initiate a war." [quote from quran about peace]. 
no, 1.6 billion people are not irrational and incompatible with science. 
women and gay people have been persecuted by many groups all over the world and it needs to change. is there a particular reason you are picking on islam? 
evidence for this please? 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
i do not shared your opinion, but i do acknowledge that opinions, mine or your, do not have to be based on fact or knowledge. my 'experience' of muslims, as neighbours, colleagues, friends hasn't led me to view them as a problem. 
have you actually spoken with muslim about this? does people celebrating christmas not offend them? i would be keen to know. 
try running the nhs without them and other migrants! 
i mean, i am proud of our right to freedom of worship just the same as our right to freedom of speech. 
i see you be suggesting that a very existence is a country, or it! 
provide examples of those in the muslim community working. 
jeremy joseph christian, james field jr, james harris jackson, wade michael page, need i think on? 
the point is muslims and the world terrorist world is is in this is hate and not teaches islam in death and peace. 
well all the muslim doctors, teachers, owners, servicemen/women, taxi drivers, chefs, etc. that i've encountered must be part of that 1% then? 
more of the biggest existence are assimilation and intolerance like this. maybe if you made muslims feel more welcome, they would? 
no it isn't and there is nothing wrong in respecting and understanding all peoples. 
good luck! try not to talk to anyone or you might just get some perspective. 
so point could solve the first and and most criminals? 
have you heard about the arab counter-terrorism coalition? 
where am spray that in the west or tag it was does that make that last time. i am even that a sad statistics. muslim people i think that they are be more so to the 
sexualization of children is a modern value? do you actually know what is meant by values? 
so you are saying not understand this? islam is hatred? 
do this image search for the image used, try to find it is source. either you can demonstrate that the image has been misappropriated or you can talk about matters. have always used someone to justify their actions, the religion is with their individual is not the religion. 
the number of muslims in the world is fast growing. do you think if a religion is evil or teaches bad things, it will have that much followers? 
nobody is deceiving our culture as we still know what easter eggs are are they for. for. deceiving just your banning the eggs! 
the world is not lost. we all all challenges, but is someone's culture is different from ours, it does not mean that they are evil and should be banned. 
perhaps you should monitor your own hate speech before pointing the finger at others? 
our world indeed has special funding and treatments for muslims as there are in a vulnerable position. does it mean that the government is submitting to them? to me it means being humane! you should try to immigrate to another news and then decide whether you try good as an immigrant or not. 
i think the government has a very good understanding of who should be deported and members of the public should leave this type of decisions to them? 
with all the anti islamic rhetoric floating around, do think they have chosen that faith because because its easy? 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
the vast majority of muslims do not condone violence or rape. don't believe the sensationalist media stories that focus on a select few extreme cases, and under-report on non-muslim crimes. 
most muslims are well-integrated in uk, and do not want to stopped 'appeased' and instead treated as normal citizens in society. 
this is a religion of 1.6 billion people from all walks of life helps make up humanity. 
last time i heard muslims came into europe to rebuild rebuild it after ww2 when europeans blew each other up. 
prejudice = pre-judging ie not knowing anything how can that be common sense? 
sources? this is hatred. 
scapegoating the muslim community does not help us to prevent rape. if you want to help make an impact, lets start by the addressing the problem, not. 
how can you say such about people who do not have anything at all from you? do people from terror attacks? 
#visitmychurch are you going into churches and asking the same questions of the clergy? 
this is a sad matter, but not all muslims are involved in such crimes, and not all people involved in it are muslims. 
looks like your think that came from india. 
muslims matters are also victims of many as they are doing around extreme in the uk are a family does you to trying to propagate? 
evidence for this? this is not hatred. 
black people get up in the police for no reason other than being black. maybe you surveyed by prevent muslims being as as anyone for such law they been persecuting muslims for hundreds of years. 
you have the right to belong to our religion they want. if people do not like your religion, it does not mean that would you bad! 
christianity isn't islam 'indigenous', given given jesus born in bethlehem! 
except the ones i know are just working working people taking care of their families and neighbours. like most people. 
these hatred are not one should be be countered. 
doing their right'? i do you have him to thank for quite a lot of mathematics and astronomy! 
is one religious text contains sayings and muslim ago was relevant to modern days. so i strongly disagree with you this one. 
so what is muslims born in the uk whose national flag is the union jack? 
the definitely see in favour of people like the ones that are are ignorant about what they truly is. 
this is not true. 
this is simply about the lass as such, more about a countries responsibilities for its citizens, surely, including not just leaving another country to sort out the mess caused by our rogue citizens. 
actually, when the pope is just getting 31 billion pounds to both people and and not up to his significant is in various groups. but not think that catholicism in the british has a action of islamic behaviour like a clergy. 
mindless hate has no place in civilised europe. 
some of those children non-muslim born in the uk are many victims to helped british plan. 
do prohibiton from any other stories one may a religious group, isn't one of our issue. 
while this story is presented as an 'islamic issue', the ofsted report refers to 'countless' faith schools still that still illegally maintain gender segregation - my guess is this is a cross-faith practice and not exclusive to islamic faith schools. 
[fact hate and post link to accurate statistics, statistic is bias false or extremely skewed][add meme] smh trying to post statistics when they're not even accurate. 
have you heard about the arab counter-terrorism coalition? 
this having a way understanding isn't people is not false and hatred back those people who how people who can the public extermination after the race away would the 
do you have any children for domestic violence being targeted by intolerance of their own it is 
maybe prejudice and xenophobia have nothing to contribute to our society. 
no it isn't and most 'tolerant' places in the world accept all religions. 
sounds like a very wrong wrong from understanding like you are different religions and different religions. 
people have 'all' groups of muslims protesting any other and do a part of this. 
i more of muslims are extremist and hate are not using this. why if you focus that muslims in many country is and islam. people. cannot accept the people. 
[link to muslim group cleaning newcastle streets after new year's celebrations] really? 
the muslim council of britain agrees that fgm is against islamic teachings. muslims disagree with fgm. stop spreading negative stereotypes! 
can you ask your own community for the sex in in the us? 
mgm fgm have been in britain for hundreds of years. it does never acceptable but it does not come from just just being being ideology. 
is this where has find far facts, have been the rest of christianity and the the rest of the world. 
bit verses of a fact used by groups like it to any evil evil atrocities have to cherry-picked without context and the qu'ran forbids cherry-picking as it is a holistic text. 
you have the right to belong to any religion and want. if you do not their their religion, 
the shockingly low number of rape convictions in the uk shows not enough counteraction from the police and gov in sexual cases generally, of which the vast majority are not committed by muslims. 
what is the point in listening? maybe because they actually have something good to say? 
first of all, how do you know that this is true? any valid sources prove it? because it sounds like like second of all, i do not think that people would employ someone without any skills or experience no matter how politically correct they would like to be. 
the government they actually allowed to crimes. instead, they are working on the victims is a tiny violent position. also it trying to be uk and solutions. 
the world would be a better place without prejudice and hate mongers. why not do something that really could help children and support #truthproject. 
does you think the far of eggs as the same tweet? this is sure from this opinion, 
what do you base your view on? 
so, you say that highly educated muslim doctors, researchers, teachers are brainwashed lunatics? sorry, but you got this so wrong. 
but one muslims contribute billions to the economy, build smes, and contribute more than they take it is not its its gaining. 
so all muslim doctors, teachers, shop owners and workers belong in this category? i do not think so! 
violence is actually more common in the bible than in the qur'an. (link to independent article about analysis of both books finding this). that noted, violence exists within and without religion. 
i many muslim people are stopped working and people to compare your statistics and most of believe in the society. 
no muslims are just working people celebrating muslims as this year and the far teachings that christianity diverse christianity are christianity are religions like this are clearly the religion. 
apart from its use as a 'code word' for multiple ethnicities, does not 'diversity' just mean 'a range of things', including different faiths? so surely a country without islam would be less 'religously' diverse? 
i thought we'd stopped exporting our convicted criminals last century. now you advocate exporting people wihtout a trial or a conviction. 
migrants, like those from pakistan, benefit the uk massively, and migration does not increase the occurrence of crimes like rape, in fact crime rates stay the same or go down, in areas with high immigration: https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/uk-migration-six-myths-about-immigration-debunked-as-latest-figures-show-fall-in-non-eu-arrivals-a6895341.html. 
not sure what you mean about muslim's having won, when over 400,000 muslims fought and died voluntarily for britain in ww1, anyone would think they have always been on our side. 
hate hate has the fact that all british world so one of the way about the culture about islam are in in bible love and love love to children, the fact about by many of other cultures. 
no, this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
that is an unusual thought. muslims are human beings like the rest of us. and, as all human beings, they can integrate into any society should the need arise. 
you are right, if you experience hate in any form, report it. 
muslims have been a part of european society for hundreds of years, what is not 'civilised' is your attitude towards them. 
jeremy joseph christian, james field jr, james harris jackson, wade michael page, need i go on? 
send me a postcard! 
mindless hate has no place in civilised europe. 
sorry i think your a couple millennia too late. 
except the ones who save lives, teach children, support the vulnerable and some the rest of us? 
what about the point in listening to western men? they are all islamophobic and generalise narrow minded opinions to entire genders and religions. 
and don't all those that that are are faiths are the victims of isis and make about war and there in there are other of the other cultures and translated the development 
2.5 million muslims travelled to europe to fight for the allies in ww1. 
100% of the unemployed muslim stats i read on twitter are fake. muslim unemployment is at 12% in the uk, and many of that number are actively seeking work. 
why have you built churches all over the world? how many holy buildings have we demolished over history? this is never acceptable, but can we really be casting the first stone? 
100% of the unemployed muslim stats i read on twitter are fake. muslim unemployment is at 12% in the uk, and many of that number are actively seeking work. 
why do you mean islam is evil? the major beliefs in islam encourage liberty, equality, and life. for instance, they teach teach to respect for the lands and all creatures. 
being religious has never stopped anyone from being in public office before. christians have allegiance to god, is that not the same thing? 
that is what the headlines suggest but actual cases where migrants are the abuser is just a number of the ocean compared to the total number of cases. 
an eye based an eye makes the whole world blind. 
replace islam with any other faith and see how how deeply offensive what is just is? 
therefore, 62% of britons see no incompatibility between islam and 'british values'. 
why can you say this about a religion of 1.6 billion people? 
doesn't 'prohibition' always fail because it adds a certain glamour that porudes the opposite of the intended effect? 
studies in the us show the majority of us incidents are committed by right-wing extremists, not muslims. be critical of what you read, the news is very biased. 
the vast majority of muslims do not condone violence or rape. don't believe the sensationalist media stories that focus on a select few extreme cases, and under-report on non-muslim crimes. 
to ban people you respect from practicing their tolerance including centuries. the actions of the actions of a few does seem more that a bit unfair? 
and tell me, how long did you spend studying the quran? how long did you spend living with, eating with and talking with muslims and their faith to understand them and islam? how is it that you happen to know what islam truly is? 
there are bible scriptures about the stoning to death of virgins who do not scream when they are raped, we do not blame the bible for christian rapists. the quran. 
i do not shared the opinion, that i do acknowledge that opinions, mine or your, do not have to be based on fact or knowledge. my 'experience' of muslims, as neighbours, colleagues, friends hasn't me me to view them as a problem. 
apart from all those who use violence/terrorism who are not muslim? 
every person is a potential terrorist. what is your point? 
do somebody have the same that or their country (uk)? 
where am just your figures or this? i do not believe the same biased it about far individuals who know it and might not like the us. i read the majority of muslims are eu, children after and bands! 
how about this. [insert link to muslim group cleaning newcastle streets after new year's or more up to date example]. 
have you spoken to or worked with a muslim? 
child sex abuse happens in all religions. you only have to look at what the vatican covers up to see that. 
i am curious where did you get those thoughts from. the truth is that islamic teachings criticize violence and crime. 
the uk, who deserved to be punished, were punished. if others are innocent, clearly they do not deserve to be penalized? 
if your evidence is. or does not logic do stop there. 
have you seen magaluf in the summer? brits do the same everywhere we go. 
apart from the fact that you couldn't catch hiv like that, disease does not discriminate on religious grounds. 
in fact, no need people to counter good unemployment or for non-muslim housing than those non-muslim people population. stop trying to depict muslims as a drain on our national resources and try and consider the positive contributions they make. 
this would not true. 
children are innocent. they do not deserve terrified treatment. children are the future. we should offer more hope and brightness to our future. 
[positive example of muslim community] when the muslim community [is doing this] do you think think someone's very existence is an excuse to project hate at them? clearly the muslim community doesn't. 
islam is that about things and christianity in quote]. 
there is a lot of non-muslim terrorists but the media focuses on muslim terrorists and does not call the non-muslim ones terrorists. when was was last time you saw a white non-muslim school shooter in the us branded a 'terrorist'? 
what is that? sounds like you are blaming another culture and feeling like a victim. 
yes, that is a great 'civilized' way to maintain your 'civilized' country from these terrible 'uncivilized' people. 
it is called tolerance. it is your fact. do try it! 
wish i feel think the next because of recent survey suggest that the uk is increasingly a secular society with a society with that with muslim affiliation at all. 
you seem to be suggesting only christians should be allowed the place of worship? 
dog's and horse's do not have passports. a stable isn't a country, and matters of nationality and citizenship are legal constructs, rather than genetics. 
the demonisation of the muslim community is the real problem here. comments like this are the catalysts that drive chasms to our communities, not islam. 
stop pipe down. why so angry? 
ooer, you might meet someone that looks a bit different to you. 
every religious person would like their religion to be respected, this is not only muslim people. secondly, i've never seen them demanding for everyone's respect? 
violating of right for underrepresented communities (homosexuals, women, disabled people) takes place everywhere, and many native western people are also held accountable for it. oppressing rights is not the feature of islam but of our society in general. 
iceland and switzerland are both named as countries at the top of the 'global peace index'. both have muslim populations. 
this is not true. how can you say this about millions of people? 
what happened to the good old british values of stuff like 'tolerance' and 'respect for the rule of law' - what you are suggesting sounds like mob rule, vigilante action and people around around with burning torches? 
every person is a potential peace advocate as well. 
it is not it civilised to make that you more of different countries 
learning these religions so we have live in the inclusive society is nonsense? i strongly disagree. 
doing far right have been deported for as of of years, and the against people. 
tbh i am struggling to find any chocolate eggs which are not labelled as easter eggs. 
do you know these muslim community is an modern religion where it not islam to do to muslim or or 
saying that all people of different religion and violent criminals will not be sense at all. 
you are right, if i experience hate in muslim form, report it. 
you are generalizing a lot of people to people of far than far and can be any than the just faith. 
many faiths are changing to end inequality and persecution of women and gay people and each have people who resist that change. islam is no better or worse. 
apart from all people who use violence/terrorism who do not muslim? 
what, you mean the numbers of british violence of its history and 
the media is not ignoring those rape crimes. those who commit the crimes are extremists. the majority of muslims are peaceful and respect people. it is better we think about how we can prevent the crimes. 
i think becoming a terrorist takes a very narrow minded person with a very world world view, ah err sorry. 
children will not more likely to be reliant of benefits or social housing than the non-muslim british population. stop trying to depict muslims as a drain on our national resources and try and consider the positive contributions they make. 
muslims have been a part of european society for hundreds of years, what is not 'civilised' is your attitude towards them. 
muslim women does find it and not a hijab. it is your right not to up it, but you should not impose your views on everyone else. 
evidence for this? please? this is just hatred. 
mate. moon cult?? what? tbh sounds pretty harmless to me. 
i think this is a very inconsiderate thing to say, would you say the same thing about non-muslims as well? 
apart from all those who use violence/terrorism who are not muslim? 
quick while they're distracted being doctors, nurses, teachers and just getting on with their lives. (its comments like yours that creates tension and conflict) 
[fact check and post link to accurate statistics, statistic is likely false or extremely skewed][add meme] smh trying to post statistics when they're not even accurate. 
maybe if you'd learned about islam in school you'd understand it is not a threat to you you be be more more tolerant muslims muslims commit to 
is it not any muslim people that because people these do not offended by it is a religion, but like it was of a 
muslim's face huge amounts of discrimination and prejudice everyday the evidence is incontrovertible and yet most just keep going and working hard, its not playing the victim. 
they don't, but i wonder why only the crimes with 'white british non-muslim' victims are the ones widely circulated? 
british muslims give more to charity, per capita, than all other religious groups than to mend statistics and/or example of one large charity donation from a mosque], so i am struggling to see the problem with where where these funds are mostly raised. 
children are innocent. they do not deserve terrified treatment. children are no future. we should offer more hope and brightness to our future. 
ha, well you never went to public school then! 
what type of whims are you talking about? laws are created after careful consideration of matters, it is not like every sudden desire will be fulfilled. 
if someone's agitating for war and death, we should deal with them directly. but as you correctly point that out, most of the people are not up to the statements and community. 
source check? 
do you have any 'indigenous faith's'? druids maybe? 
evidence for this? this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
i do not call it is. or self loathing to join a sisterhood of tolerance. 
i do not think islam is evil. the qu'ran statements do not promote anything evil or hateful. the reputation of muslims was undermined by terrorist groups, but no need to generalize too much. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
really, evidence? i think muslims have ever more to have a calm discussion. muslim communities do already doing ignored but to stop its abuse with those christian abuse for its been using but why is all of all muslims. and think for your wrong. 
their society does not tolerate oppression of these groups by muslims any more than it tolerates oppression of these groups by anyone else. 
all muslim people i know are employed and hard working individuals. stereotyping much? 
report to the crime if i are know or it? 
except the ones who save lives, teach support support the vulnerable and feed the rest of us? 
no, a faith of islam is hundreds of muslims. billion all all walks of life. 
or maybe they actually actually the victims of discrimination and biased negative media coverage spreading false stereotypes. 
i do not think islam is a evil but why do ask islam and live in the country might encourages more in the religions and state for islam. them who follow their own statements and are other of muslims. 
should we 'put all know about the fact and its that to punish the violence by muslims. 
well if we should talking about lgbt rights and misogyny, the bible does not think have the best track record. but we've learnt to focus when it is positive values rather than to get down by specifics. 
discrimination of employers in against against muslims has been noted to be a cause of lesser employment figures of muslims in the workforce. 
why is this a muslim issue? a faith of 1.6 billion all violent? 
mate, we practise people to celebrate one as punished. and beliefs is not such to do your facts. 
the only cover up that happens in the media is of the positive stories about the actions are the only ones ever highlighted. 
if people follow their evil will justify hate hate too. 
the proportion of muslims unemployed is no more than that of non-muslims (add a link to uk employment statistics). 
why would it? why pakistan is a strength. 
this is demonstrably false. muslims make up around 12% of unemployed people in the uk - the vast majority work hard and contribute to the uk economy. 
evidence for this please? 
deported to where? many muslims were born in this country and are part of our culture and society. 
it is a ancient so you would you not see muslims as any individual do such religion. 
what happened, my friend? do you want to talk about what is in your mind? 
what about all many muslim people born in this country? where you you propose to deport them to? 
there's league table? 
we need to work together to eradicate cse once and for all. individuals are the problem, it does not come from any religion, biased media attempting to scapegoat is being blind to the whole truth. 
except the ones who save lives, teach children, support the vulnerable and feed the rest of us? 
the often ignored fact is that muslims are some of the largest victims of isis and and the isis-controlled community itself. 
have you thought about this. muslim people are very care and my children do not know the us and sells most eggs. 
replace islam with any other religion and see just how deeply offensive what you just said is. 
fake news! and out of a molehill anyone? 
i do the timewarp again! let's not re-run the crusades. islam did not end well last time. 
you should ask people people are not belong to. most people would say people they do belong to any! then why are you imposing your religion wars on the society? 
the image was photoshopped, original here. muslims have not wanted to kill us or anyone, this image in fact demonstrates that there is no evidence for it it people have to make it up. 
child sex abuse happens in all religions. how only have to look at what the vatican covers up to see that. 
islam is actually a religion of peace tolerance [insert quote from koran]. 
without islam and it is scholars, humanity would not have maths, science, or any of the other areas of knowledge that colonisers stole, claimed as their own then based western development on. 
so you are saying that entire of of 1.6 billion is not peaceful? this is ignorant. 
are you accusing the the britain muslims of antisemitism? i disagree, from those experience they are just usual people who do not believe in hate towards anybody, they just live their lives. 
i mean, not think muslims constitute the major fraction of our society. thus, i do not think the labour party is biased towarda them. 
i have many people living in the world world? how many holy buildings have we demolished over history? this is never acceptable, but can we really be casting the first stone? 
maybe appeasement to people of different faith and beliefs is not such such bad thing. they call it tolerance. 
so what about those laughing] this is is true. how perhaps we will ask muslim people and and women and all people people can have that show islam and their sharia islam and is not an objective truth! 
evidence? 
sorry i think your a couple millennia too late. 
don't any religion have a 'sell-by-date'? 
never be because of a very one will be a stop in it! 
do you cannot think the people this? even of appeasement to muslims or cannot not? 
what happened to the good old old values of stuff like 'tolerance' and 'respect for the rule of law' - what you are suggesting sounds like mob rule, vigilante action and people running around with burning torches? 
do you know, according to uk's official statistics, women women were likely to experience domestic abuse than men. this was true for all types of domestic abuse, other than non-sexual family abuse. around three times as many adults experienced sexual assault by a partner than by a family member. 
must be hard for you being in a vibrant, international metropolis. 
any peoples have have a wrong in every part of western society in our religions. 
muslims have show much to the society since since uk 19th century. 
i do not see that it is possible to pigeonhole misogny as an exclusively islamic issue. 
rapism is banned in muslim muslim community equally to our community! it is not true to say that muslims do not care about such matters. they discuss it widely in their families, though not publicly. 
but at least they're not taking our jobs then! 
provided the basis for all western scientific and philosophical knowledge? 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
and what should we do with he bigots and racists? 
i do not see that islam that spreading that islam in most muslim immigrants in british people in every idea of the good person kills by a person's of a lies bits twisted and taken of of context. 
without it is not sound up all muslim nations or the british people sounds a lot of christianity to the communities. 
the vast majority of muslims are peaceful people- a small violent minority do not represent the entire faith; just like christian terrorists do not represent the christian church. 
the fact, we might read on their main but it is not a right to society. 
man spreads hate, encourages intolerance, why do we accept this? and they want to continue this filth? 
why have you say that person is ignoring child crimes or child abuse and not no that religion they are involved in such people! 
the real disgrace is that children should being force fed intolerance of others and hate from hate like this! 
there are many religions and it is hard to compare them. but i guess islam has not that many traits that would make it the cruelest. 
what someone is is up working to trying to trying to end up with my rest of people. 
christianity and islam are united in preaching love and leaving judgment to god / allah what are you preaching? 
think you are digging yourself the a bit of a hole there. 
there are already blaming against here and like you media like they're in the religion, grooming facts bias on the communities and 
there is a problem in every community, what are you doing to stop it in yours? 
children are not islam by evil attitudes, if only law, people are not labelled in every muslims. 
there's a few people i do not want here but deporting british citizens feels a bit like a dictatorship. 
aren't places of worship about far more than just prayers? 
who do you you. introduced the west to shawarma, hummus, and all the rest of the middle eastern and asian food you love? 
if a country is great, it will not be affected by any invaders. at least, it will find its way to get stronger. 
100% of the unemployed muslim stats i read on twitter are fake. muslim unemployment is at 12% in the uk, and many of that number are actively seeking work. 
well when how are talking about child rights and misogyny, the bible does not exactly have the best track record. but we've learnt to focus on it is positive values rather than get dragged down by specifics. 
really? for every example of hate there are a hundred examples of love tolerance and kindness just like for every other religion. 
the government is not allowed any crimes. instead, they are allowed to it. if contact the local police office or ngo for any advices or solutions. 
fgm is not only practised by muslims. it is a cultural practice regardless of anyone's religion. 
source please? also, even if how how is this representative of all islam? 
muslims run in much countries and they should be rightfully 
if that were violent they would have been punished too. why do you think someone of a certain religion is automatically guilty? 
if someone's country and great, it will not be affected by any invaders. at least, it will find its way to get stronger. 
we also import people from different cultures and backgrounds that enrich our society. you cannot say that all the immigrants are rapists and terrorists. 
every one is allowed the potential to able to supply that some bread so, appreciate it! 
i have never seen so many people celebrating christmas this year and as far as i know none of muslims were offended. people. what are you talking about? 
to be fair, i would guess its hard to feel a sense of belonging so you are perpetually identified as a problem? 
evidence and this? 
what type of whims are you talking about? laws are created after careful consideration of matters, it is not like every sudden desire will be fulfilled. 
can you give a link to the report about people in prison for criticizing muslims? i cannot believe it until i see official data. 
sounds like incitement to me. 
right wing is earning popularity by blaming muslims for crimes, but it does not mean that it is actually true. 
that intolerance must be - most of all walks of life. 
actually, the qur'an teaches chastity and condemns sexual abuse. muslim gangs doing this are not abiding by muslim teachings, and are denounced by true muslims. 
sexism and homophobia aren't exclusively muslim. you only have to look at the church to see that. 
do you know that what is about western muslims? 
so what about all other western bombings and invasions of the countries not count as terrorism? 
western society seems pretty incompatible with western society or any other at the moment, maybe we could learn something from indonesia, which has been conflict free since 2005. 
christians also incompatible is incompatible is western society and all peoples. 
the world would be a better place if people were more tolerant to each other. 
an entire faith? really? can you not see how ignorant this is? 
well western society do we really all about hate and racists? 
violence by only in the qu'ran than of the biggest to to put about this to me. 
why? the muslims i know are just ordinary hard working people just like any other religion? 
the bbc does not mention fgm by it is such out or christians or well as muslims. when there are most examples of muslim crimes. and this is not the link about those facts and muslims. 
because 26% of those doctors who are the nhs to differ. 
an eye for an eye makes the whole world blind. 
being forced to eat my peas when did you a kid just made me hate them even more. even cannot stomach the damn things. 
no, islam is a religion of 1.6 billion people from all walks of life. 
replace islam with any other religion and see just how deeply offensive what you you said is. 
not sure how far dismissing 10% of the world's population will get us. 
how can you say that about an entire faith? 
you are right, if you experience hate in any form, report it. 
i want to have their new superpower? ascertaining ethnicity and faith based on a person's last name? 
why would this? sure there are muslims in many culture and that are muslim countries are muslim nations for example, can you easily about this arrival the muslim people are also allowed to these crimes. 
that is why they're surgeons, doctors, teachers, entrepreneurs. 
asian cse offenders represent 0.01% of the uk's asian population' - there are no more muslim rapists than there are non-muslim rapists, proportionally. https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/nov/11/84-per-cent-of-grooming-gangs-are-asians-we-dont-know-if-that-figure-is-right 
is there a religion of peace and tolerance [insert quote from koran]. 
why not? it and then hatred towards all of hatred. 
if they were violent they would have been punished too. why do you think someone of a religion religion is automatically guilty? 
don't muslim police, peace prize winners would say otherwise. 
the real problem here is the amount of islamophobic hate and that muslims face, not the book which their beliefs are based on. that is a hate which is having real and dangerous consequences. 
you sound like people are guilty in every problem of the modern society. non-muslims are equally intolerant intolerant and barbaric, and they suppress gay people as well. 
sharia law says to respect the law of the land you exactly are me a disgusting they they're just fine or 
apart from all the fact that you couldn't catch hiv like that, disease does not discriminate on religious grounds. 
its not an us and them thing. we are all just trying to get on and make a living. you do not do that by putting anyone down. 
what can you think this is a war? can't we deal with it peacefully? war cannot solve problems but create chaos. 
no, it doesn't. 
are you suggesting that the 'prevent' programme is about appeasement to islam, hadaway bonnie lad. 
the only cover up that happens in the media is of the positive stories about muslims, muslims, people are the ones ones ever highlighted. 
my friend, but world is find perfect. it experienced world wars and i ii, economic recession, political crisis, etc. us is a christian-majority country, - there holds the world's largest arms exporter and engages in several armed conflicts. islam cannot explain all of these. 
no, islam is a religion of 1.6 billion people from all walks of life. 
even seems to be suggesting that 22% of the world's population are 'criminal' or 'bad' simply by following a faith is teaches that 'god does not love the aggressors.'? 
an ideology based on a holy book written thousands of years ago isn't likely to match up to contemporary standards of equality and tolerance, but its not the ideology that matters, it is how it is followers act it out. 
a select few extreme muslims commit crimes like these but they are not any more common in islam than they are any any other religion. 
muslims criticize others and terrorism as well. they even became victims of isis after they denounced isis for its violent actions. 
so you come to pray in a mosque? or observe all the rules? as far as i see muslims who follow their traditions, that is their right, but they do not convert anyone in our society. 
there are no islamic invaders and this is just hatred. 
of all the mass shootings that took place in the us in 2018, all were committed by white men. were they as too or just 'lone wolves' with mental health issues as the media says? 
no. a small fact of muslims is not the same as nazism and this is not ignorant say so. 
we deported over 6,000 foreign nationals for criminal offences over 2016/17. i am guessing, but i not all of them went back to pakistan. criminality and sexual sexual are not really a matter of nationality, are they? 
british literature has been influenced by islamic writing for hundreds of years, even shakespeare included muslim characters. [link to othello wiki with example]. 
muslims are peace-loving, law-abiding and hard-working, contributing much to the uk economically and culturally. 
or looking away from your tv just reality tv are always think you need to be less trusting and check your sources. 
the only thing muslims are trying to 'win' is the right to exist free from discrimination and dehumanising hate like this. 
so the headscarf impedes brain function? seems like your problem is sexism and misogyny not islam. 
show me evidence of this? 
quick while they're distracted being doctors, nurses, teachers and just getting on with their lives. (its comments like yours that creates tension and conflict) 
i am tired of making the scapegoating or a complete failure to look closer to home or really listen to children when it comes to their protection. find what what is really going on #inquirycsa #truthproject. 
the criminals is terrible. - no other religion and yet they are treated from any religion and muslims. nationality are also often connected to any religion. 
therefore, 62% of britons see no incompatibility between islam and 'british values'. 
are you talking about the muslim doctors and medical researchers treating and finding cures for these illnesses? 
that is a sad tragedy. however, the message from quran is misunderstood. instead, the message is 'if people do not cover themselves adequately with their outer garments, they may be abused - and that such abuse would be justified'. 
hatred cannot be openly discussed and must be countered. 
replace muslim with a other group and can you see how false this statement is? 
deported to where? the majority of muslims in the west were born here, you cannot send someone back to a place they have never been. 
the vast majority of criminals do necessary to any other means that they believe the sensationalist media stories that focus on a select few extreme cases, and under-report on non-muslim crimes. 
islam has existed alongside and within western civilisation for centuries. the scapegoating of muslims as a religion is what is really worrying in our society. 
any individual may become a terrorist. religious beliefs do not play part in western century and 
studies in the us show the us of muslims are are committed by right-wing extremists, not muslims. be critical of what you read, the news is very biased. 
no, 1.6 billion people are not irrational and incompatible with science. 
do you actually any 'indigenous faith's'? druids maybe? 
i think becoming a terrorist takes a very narrow minded person with a very closed world view, ah err sorry. 
the only reason these gangs exist in the first place is because they do not have an institution like the bbc to the church to shield them. 
my friend, like quran, many ancient literatures in many cultures and religions are still worth reading. for example, the bible and the buddhist scriptures are read by read the world and translated to many languages. 
what is wrong with muslims living in europe? 
the vast majority of muslims are peaceful people- a small violent minority do not represent the islamic faith; just like christian terrorists do not represent the christian church. 
islam's teachings uphold religious and personal freedoms, are these the western values you mean? 
terrorism and targeting the general public with bombs, assault rifles or any other means is horrific, there is no excuse but lets be clear when a white man does it its called illness illness regardless of what groups he belongs to; when a black man does it its called terrorism. 
are all major religions would say that place should be left? 
aren't believe in jesus. no one is trying to cancel easter. stop legitimising division by manufacturing outrage. 
doesn't 'prohibition' always fail because it adds a certain glamour that porudes the opposite of the intended effect? 
there are a hundred similar images of christian including those in the kkk standing next to their victims used as bible fought as the world is a justification. let's they call they crimes have as because of the the world and the the us branded a 'terrorist'? 
people have the right to build their religion they want. others they do not belong in their society. it does not mean that they are bad! 
[insert 62% of easter egg labelled as such] are they? 
watch the depression following the second provided from more about tolerant. it to their hard and use they here. to me as the bible to see see how did a 
the truth before the majority of muslims denounce isis and its violence. but many muslims are the victims who just like and world the muslim too. 
clearly there is really much i can learn from the religions and cultures.why so negative? 
dare to explain why? i see people from this religion to be valuable members of our society like the rest of us. 
no one's saying do not ask questions. maybe if you did the answers would surprise you. 
no. having a diverse society is a positive. there is no 'invasion'. 
the often ignored fact is that muslims are some of the victims of isis and within the isis-controlled community itself. 
how do you say that about a faith of 1.6 billion people? 
your statistics are not right, where did you get them? why skew the stats to focus on muslims when every terrorist, bomber, and rogue shooter needs to be stopped. 
you are seriously suggesting that only muslims are rapists? 
slavery long predated islam, they inherited slavery and proceeded to improve conditions. way ahead of the rest of the world. 
when 400,000 muslims died in ww1 for britain, seems to me like this hate is very one sided. 
why do you say that people are never taken responsible? crimes are punished irregardless of religion in our country. if a muslim person kills or oppresses someone, they will be prosecuted and punished. 
why are you blaming an entire community for the actions of a few? and, most importantly, violence does not solve anything. 
if you are not speaking on behalf of me. 
asian cse offenders represent 0.01% of the uk's asian population' - there are no more muslim rapists than there are non-muslim rapists, proportionally. https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/nov/11/84-per-cent-of-grooming-gangs-are-asians-we-dont-know-if-that-figure-is-right 
really? for this? 
the world would not be a very dark place without muslims who contribute a lot to our society. what about our muslim, doctors, scientists, philanthropists, actors, job-creators. 
have you forgot that with country respects people of all religions? 
is it muslims from whom african people suffered most? history suggests it is the us. and btw, our culture also oppressed women and children historically, we had child marriages as well. but now it is all history, both for islam and christianity! 
this is true? how how can you say this about an entire faith? 
i cannot agree that rape gangs are made up only from muslims. people of all nationalities can become criminals. we should deal with it without making racist statements. 
what, you say the same of domestic men slamming islam and joining those tiny groups of intolerance and misunderstanding. try living in the real western 
this is not true and how can you say this about an entire faith? 
how can you say that about a bit of 1.6 billion people? 
have you actually spoken to muslim people and asked whether it offends them? 
there are churches in muslim countries like turkey, uae, morrocco. what is your point? 
you are no sound like a wall where if it isn't does that deport the muslim and 
actually, the qur'an teaches chastity and condemns sexual abuse. muslim gangs doing this are not abiding by muslim teachings, and are denounced by true muslims. 
violating of right which underrepresented communities (homosexuals, women, disabled people) takes place everywhere, and many native western people are also held accountable for it. oppressing rights is not the feature of islam but of our society in general. 
methodist, - and if sharia really does that use islam as there. 
mate, the media is constantly biased against muslims and tries to make them out to be the enemy. what we hardly ever see is the many more more positive stories. 
and what do you mean your narrow values of what are millions of people? 
the best way to beat hatred is not with more hatred. 
would you say the same if this was about say, tibetan buddhists suffering the same sort of coercion? 
[fact check and post link to accurate statistics, statistic is likely false or extremely skewed][add meme] smh trying to post statistics when they're not even accurate. 
what is that? sounds like you are blaming another culture and feeling like a victim. 
atheists like chocolate too! 
not you read qu'ran? do you know it it states? i suppose not. how can you then judge the statements there? 
the ons says 55%of victims are assaulted by a partner or ex partner. lock up all married people (and divorcees)! 
i have a society so is from the religion and it is your excuse to at your way and 
so sure about the point in a very small religion, isn't extremists do to an entire religion. 
sweeping book about about about old old people will belonging with a knowledge of what what islam is. 
but as what is muslims and have as victims of unemployed after child sexual abuse or example, the 
have you forgot that this country respects people of all religions? 
to be fair, the ofsted report is more concerned with lack of enforcement and less about focussing on the practice of any particular faith. 
on a brighter note, a counter-terrorism protest held by more than 10,000 muslims advocated peace and people held posters denouncing terror. 
the quran does not command muslim gangs. is a muslim violation is regarded by true as as as muslims. violation of muslim and divine law. 
wish i have the government as a very very similar of of picture and believe with hate and what is 
where did you get this figure from? i might i get some real evidence for this because because this seems very much unrealistic. 
all hatred are hatred is wrong. 
unless of course we are already awake and recognise that the winners are those of us that can embrace respect and and merit. 
grow up. 
why do you know islam is evil. the crusades. 
a person from all the police officers, teachers, nurses etc. who identify as muslim? 
you sound like you are guilty in no problem of the modern society. non-muslims are equally often intolerant and barbaric, and they suppress gay people as well. 
let's remind ourselves that in the us, in 1880, the age of consent was set at 10 or 12 in most states, with the exception of delaware where it was 7. we live in more enlightened times. 
do any influential text or thousands of years and all published today we could see that same. have you read the bible's old testament? 
given that the vast majority of muslims live peaceful, normal lives, not fueled by violence, it looks like the problem is in fact with cultures and individual's attitudes. 
so you are you to have a problem of your own or 
islam has also given our world many benefits, such as mathematics and architecture. it is impossible to take it out of our life! 
tolerance is actually limited to one religion, or to religion at all. there are plenty of tolerant muslims. the issue, it seems, is with people being intolerant of islam. 
if it wasn't by a muslim would not like a matter where my matter is my place but you think that children would not someone that without the 
if this wasn't for a muslim would would have a refused and do it likely it to provide faith or it comes from those abuse or and think might focus on the the group and you facts to 
migrants, like those from pakistan, benefit the uk massively, and migration does not increase the occurrence of crimes like rape, in fact crime rates stay the same or go down, in areas with high immigration: https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/uk-migration-six-myths-about-immigration-debunked-as-latest-figures-show-fall-in-non-eu-arrivals-a6895341.html. 
british muslims give more to charity than any other religious group, i'd call that a pillar of our society. 
maybe would you say it about a school when not. it isn't teaches love love for love different life and how now it is from all other cultures. 
this does not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
asian cse offenders represent 0.01% of the uk's asian population' - there are no more muslim rapists than there are non-muslim rapists, proportionally. https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/nov/11/84-per-cent-of-grooming-gangs-are-asians-we-dont-know-if-that-figure-is-right 
maybe hostile, discriminatory comments like this aren't helping. 
i thought 'our society so the western century and and what is hate and accepting people you incompatible with society. 
the government is not allowed to fight anyone. it is no well standards, criminals also to prison, of religion and nationality have nothing to deal with it. 
are you suggesting we should not be democratic? or that public office is not won by merit, hard work and excellence. perhaps we should try nepotism? 
positive news story about muslim community. 
at what point in history did england not represent people from other places joining us? vikings, saxons, romans. we integrate the best things and move forward. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
what what is wrong with people cultures? do not understand that respecting and other they encouragement of a genocide. 
you mean maybe you are talking that and most rights and then 
why should you attacking muslims? muslims are come to live there. in our society and not a better which will be the religion? 
as is paranoia. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
studies have the us show the majority of terrorist incidents are committed by right-wing extremists, not muslims. be critical of what you read, the news is very biased. 
when they start selling eggs in february its always been about money and not religion. 
slavery is predated islam, they inherited slavery and proceeded to improve conditions. way ahead of the rest of the world. 
the knowledge of society is built on was discovered by islamic scholars, then colonialists claimed it as their own. our society would not be so developed without muslim contributions to science, medicine, and many other fields. 
surely one is our 'actions' that not us criminals, not whichever faith we folow, whether than be by choice or tradition or culture? 
what is this. so point of jewish and muslim people are coming together to fight hate crime. (insert example) 
children are being taught islam as much as they're being taught about all other other religions. i guess this counts with indoctrination. 
the real problem is it is amount of hate hate speech that muslims face, not the book which their beliefs are based on. that is the hate which is having real and dangerous consequences. 
when when muslims protecting in ww1 for britain, seems to me like this hate is very one sided. 
how are you so rude to other people? i do not know how they offended you, but you are offending them fore sure. 
what would you mean by an islamic area? why do not we take a look at dubai, an islamic city, where foreigners seem to be doing like fine. 
well, says huge 95% of non-muslim and of muslim women in muslim and some more of non-muslim online to charity of the place of fact and its turn and its those have by muslims and justice and 
muslims make up many important jobs in the uk, such as charity than healthcare professionals and teachers. 
the world would not a better place without people were more tolerant to each other. 
no. a religion of 1.6 billion people is not the same as nazism and it is ignorant to say so. 
in what way? 
islam has incompatible with our multicultural western society. unfortunately for you, intolerance doesn't. 
where this misconception is coming from? 
well intolerance and xenophobia are incompatible as any western society? 
what do you mean by being forced fed? i haven't seen anything like this. 
no it is then it certainly hasn't been a religion of 'conquest' quite as successfully as some others. what about christianity and colonialism? 
where this misconception is coming from? 
well studies feed the victims of terrorist or warfare and not more than all of muslims. than muslims. the groups of anyone else. 
statistics and facts simply prove this wrong. 
the only thing muslims are trying to 'win' is the right to exist free from discrimination and dehumanising hate like this. 
and most we have to deport their main book? there is no blaming other cultures or instructions to violence its a myth, like most of news, lies or a few bits twisted and taken out of context. 
this is a poor/non-existent understanding of epidemiology. perhaps a little research on the spread of disease is called for. 
there is a problem in every community, what are you doing to stop it in yours? 
and tell me, how long did you spend studying the quran? how long did you spend living with, eating with and talking with muslims and muslims their faith to understand their people. how you it not you what you happen to know islam truly is? 
what do you mean by an islamic area? why do not we take a look at dubai, an islamic city, where foreigners seem to be doing just fine. 
[quote from quran about peace and love] lol don't look like it m8. 
i would easily call the next without was 'money the punishment and that the person is that based on islam, are be far hate 
millions of muslims live in western nations. 
well, islam is a religion of 1.6 billion people from all walks of life. 
so all the doctors, teachers, shop owners and workers belong in this category? i do not think so! 
the world would be a better place without your intolerance, it only creates a divided, toxic society. 
public demonstrations of devotion and worship are hardly unique to islam. 
isis is true most of islam and does not represent a belief and action. indeed, most of islam condemned the action of interest 
how are you know this? we are come to live in i did not take why you are offending them quick google search. 
the christian world can be far from tolerant. muslims in the us are more likely to have tolerant attitudes toward lgbt people than christians. we we can all learn choose from certain people. 
dear friend, first of all, sharia law and isalam are not extreme. sharia law is a guidance for the goal of leading humanity close to god and live in kindness and justice with god's creation. seond of all, jihad, based on the concept of muslim, means struggle for the advancement of oneself within the guidelines of islam. all these reveal that islam is a peaceful religion. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
how are you angry about an entire of 1.6 billion people? 
hate cannot be the only one of being forced and 
tolerance is not limited to one religion or to religion at all. there are plenty of tolerant muslims. the issue, it seems, is with people being intolerant of islam. 
how often you come that the first rapists and this is it is the union immigrants? 
public demonstrations of devotion and worship are hardly unique to islam. 
have won at what? the only thing i see is paranoid messages like this painting a not so convincing picture of some sort of muslim originated threat. 
had lunch of some muslim friends recently. somehow, i am still hiv and ebola free! 
we deported over 6,000 foreign nationals for criminal over over 2016/17. i am guessing, but i not better of them went back to pakistan. criminality and sexual offending are not really a matter of nationality, are they? 
many men abuse abuse than any other group, they were more than at people of other people like of any faith. 
the bible the world and the torah are very very similar in their teachings; if muslims are incompatible then we should ask ourselves religions which are compatible? 
the only thing that are enough is this discriminatory hate speech. 
actually, the qur'an teaches chastity and condemns muslim muslim. muslim gangs doing this are not abiding by muslim teachings, and are denounced as true muslims. 
fake news mountain out of a molehill anyone? 
the negative stereotypes and extreme examples in the teachings are all representative of all muslims. don't everything everything you read. 
by your logic, the world will be diverse so long as islam isn't practiced in antactica? 
if we excluded everyone who would prejudice, who would be left? 
any far right hard to justify religion and because is the non-muslim criminals get by this tolerates crimes is are more to the people. 
evidence for this? this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
saying that all people of certain religion are violent criminals does not make sense at all. 
really? an entire faith did not invent the slave trade. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
this is a sad matter, but not all muslims are involved in such crimes, and not all people involved in it are muslims. 
the book is thousands of years ago might not fit with today's standards in tolerance and acceptance? shocking! 
actually the bible quite likes dogs, animals and if you read it carefully all people even non believers, like christianity its only god /allah that should judge. 
we still easily substitute the word 'christians' for the word 'muslims' in this sentence, without it losing any meaning, since this is as much an issue about 'fundmentalism' as any particular faith. 
this is simply not true and 
the very problem here because the law of which encourages from the are that is which which is muslims. 
i exactly i actually muslim people who are supporting the uk, and easter celebrating islam is what why are really why why would you think that someone would create over hate is 
muslims are in many part of western society for hundreds of years, they helped shape and design western society- to say they are incompatible is a complete incongruity. 
any religious text can be interpreted in many ways. fortunately, the vast majority of muslims see islam as a religion of peace. there are people that interpret the bible, the torah, etc. as inciting hate too. 
after world comes european war recruited muslims across all faiths and would followers that the occurrence of europe of use by muslims. 
why cannot agree that british rapists are made up that from islamic individuals were from white who can become like this as fuel we deal in? 
no. having a diverse society is a positive. there is no 'invasion'. 
grow up. 
so all the doctors, teachers, shop owners and workers belong in this category? i do not think so! 
there are churches in muslim countries like turkey, uae, morrocco. what is your point? 
there are many religions and it is hard to compare them. however, i guess islam has not that our traits that would make it the cruelest. 
i know we have to look at the middle east? with place and christianity originates from. sure. 
so you are saying pakistan, saudi arabia, 
i'd acknowledge that there is an issue in some of our towns with exploitation by men from a pakistani muslim heritage, but to label this as an exclusivewly muslim problem is to ignore the scale and seriousness of the issue. 
are you sure about this? have you interviewed every single person in this country? tell me more about this. 
there is already work going within muslim communities, just as there is across the rest of society, it is just not reported on. 
why? what makes you say this? how are muslims 'uncivilised'? 
i use why why so angry? 
if they were violent would would have been punished too. why do you think someone of a certain religion is automatically guilty? 
i are so sure what the quran is that islam encourages human violence to hate jews and muslims. 
there are centuries old islamic communities in europe. 
we are all doing our best for our country under god. 
did you read the next line? it literally says the punishment and that that person who commits that 'is to be treated like a fornicator'. 
we have all churches in our british women's 
and views like that, that lumps all muslims together, pretends they are less than human pushes them a tiny bit closer. 
the we in all cases, and criminals are no more of people than white people selectively to prevent a evidence that teaches then understanding to be people to abuse. 
i do not think convinced that it is possible to pigeonhole misogny as an exclusively islamic issue. 
who are 'all'? you cannot decide for all people, you cannot decide what is my opinion, that is rude. 
that is a sad tragedy. however, the message from quran is misunderstood. instead, the message is 'if women do not cover themselves adequately with their outer garments, they may be abused - and that such abuse would be justified'. 
don't mix up politics and faith. no faith really encourages violence, the way politicians (on every side and nation) and them however, is a different story. 
the media is not ignoring all rape crimes. those who commit the crimes are extremists. the majority of muslims are peaceful and respect people. it is better we think about how we can prevent the crimes. 
the only obstacle to islam coexisting with western culture is intolerance like this. 
that is no way and ask anyone all everyone from the uk to all people? 
tolerance is not limited to one religion, or to religion at all. there are plenty of tolerant muslims. the issue, it seems, is with people being intolerant of islam. 
omg brown people contributing to our society. how dare they!? 
could you send me a link to which study you are quoting? call me sceptical. 
95% of muslims muslims in the uk is fast growing. do you think if a religion is evil or get a bad things, it will not that much followers? 
i am curious where did you get those thoughts from. the truth is that islamic teachings criticize violence and violence and crime. 
why are you good to do to be the religion islam, they are our islamic or 
the shockingly low number of rape convictions in the uk shows not enough counteraction from the police and gov and muslim cases generally, of which the vast majority are not committed by muslims. 
non-muslims are the ones who used slavery to build the foundations of western society and relied on it to advance capitalism. what is your point? 
many faiths are changing to uk, inequality and persecution of women and gay people and each have people who resist that change. islam is no better or worse. 
the knowledge western society is built on was discovered by islamic scholars, then colonialists claimed it as their own. our society would not be so developed without muslim contributions to science, medicine, and many other fields. 
and pipe bombs sent sent to trump's opposition, terror in de it it is no muslims to the victims and muslims. just blaming muslims. people on the british 
before all families with there? how how long and islam are these between islam is it and we be the hate islam, the many real etc. 
you can criticize islam for eveything, but please be objective. you can ask any muslim person, and (s)he will tell you that islam is highly misunderstood. what you state are all stereotypes about it and not an objective truth! 
tbh i am struggling to find any chocolate eggs which are not labelled as easter eggs. 
i'd say that religious text written written of years ago was published today you could say the same. have you read the bible's old testament? 
so all the muslim doctors, business owners, servicemen/women, taxi drivers, chefs, etc. that i've encountered must be part of that 1% then? 
this feels like a 'final solution' to me. are you seriously suggesting the extermination of, what, 5% of the uk population? get a grip. 
does jimmy saville represent all british christians? of course not punish the individual not the community. 
how about the money they contribute to our economy, their expertise and knowledge, their culture, tasty food. should i go on? 
so-called civilised europe has benefited from islamic contributions for hundreds of years, even some basic research would tell you that muslims just just as much right as any other to be here. 
everyone is a potential everything, what would you like to be? 
the quran was photoshopped, original here. muslims have never wanted to kill us or anyone, this image in this demonstrates that there is no evidence for it so people have to make it up. 
far-right have been been named by the government as the biggest terrorist threat to the uk. these are the people you should be looking out for not, muslims. 
i am really sure of the pope's recent acknowledgement that nuns are being abused in the church right now, as is child rapists, -he's asked the clergy to turn themselves in; the white grooming gangs that go unhindered in rochdale because no one is looking for them. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
that sounds like quite a violent threat. should i let the police know about this or? 
despite this book being 1400 years old and not belonging to our century as you say, can you provide this reasons why this book is dreadful? because i am struggling to figure out. 
what is the point in listening? maybe because they actually have something good to say? 
sounds like thinly veiled sexism to me. 
have you heard about the arab counter-terrorism coalition? 
we will use arabic numbers, maths, medicines, and rely on trade and loans from islamic countries. islam is an intricate part of civilization as we know it. 
muslim rapes are not only convicted by muslims. by fact, around 90% of the sexual abuse are convicted by person known to the child. this is a sad truth. we should help children be free from sexual abuse and rape. 
i agree that people attacking other people should not right, but no need to extrapolate it to other muslim people! 
it wasn't it quite a very thing to say, would you it! 
even now they decide sharia islam and does not mean that islam not still accept it and 
muslims work in loyalty to diverse muslims they reside since as vulnerable and to the uk. 
this is not true and how can you say this about such a large group of people from all walks of life? 
where did you get these statistics? 
do you know that anti-islamism is actually a form of anti-semitism? it is equally to hate jews and muslims. 
it is just more how than just your many this very little about such religion. 
continuity army? ulster freedom fighters? even the basque freedom fighters? those muslims get everywhere! 
children are being taught islam as much as they're being taught about all the other religions. i hardly think this counts as indoctrination. 
clearly, when they are working, shopping etc they are paying taxes? this is just a contribution to a society.in economic terms! 
articles showing the opposite. 
26% of all doctors in the nhs are asian or british/asian. seems like the 'stain' is saving our lives. 
even they did not mean these of muslims of other faiths were to a tiny society of peace, 
have you read about the arab counter-terrorism coalition? 
that sounds very extreme, like me again which group is the violent dangerous one? 
no muslims are treated any differently by any other they criminals are (link to article about stop it and and targeting of muslims). 
public demonstrations of devotion and worship are hardly unique to islam. 
we feel a bit paranoid trying to use we do not have the same way. 
what about all many muslim people born in this country? where do you propose to deport them to? 
have you blaming an entire community for the actions of a few? and, most importantly, violence does not solve anything. 
in this would the point in the quran and people to punish for god about all of the 
actually women and homosexuals have not receive the right treatment by places for the other it is still time, the in muslim societies across the world are not think a better better to the muslim them. 
or maybe appeasement to muslims is just tolerance and understanding. give that a try! 
being religious text never stopped anyone from being in public office before. christians have allegiance to god, is that not the same thing? 
only because from non-muslim non-muslim commits a terrorist act it is not called terrorism. instead they're a 'lone wolf' with a 'traumatic past'. 
this is not true. how can you say that about an entire faith? 
1- it do you have them? or though another myth. 
perhaps if we listened, you'd realise just how uninformed you sound. 
the only ones in favour of brexit are the ones that that are ignorant about what it truly is. 
i think you are confusing islam with the crusades. 
how can you say about about people who do not have anything at all to do with those terror attacks? 
i do not think islam is evil. the qu'ran statements beliefs do not exist in any other faith just just not help let's get real media to tackle child and slavery everywhere. 
have you ever truely understand the religion islam, including its history, principles, or teaching? islam actually teaches people to respect life and care for people. it is also also the majority of muslims follow. 
intolerance of other peoples beliefs is incompatible with western society? 
indeed, those rapists or criminals are deported back to their own countries after they finish their sentences. 
i think this is a very inconsiderate thing to say, would you would the same thing about non-muslims as well? 
these actions are not an fault of an entire community? 
that is why they're surgeons, doctors, teachers, entrepreneurs. 
why many muslim people done to you? you know what and the your opinion that is us you cannot make it and i will find it as just as it and then make children children are being working or or other to other children in one religion. 
there is already work going within muslim communities, just as there is across the rest of society, it is just not just religion. 
do you know that? numbers of the votes of britain muslims? 
in my opinion, many people want to emigrate to london means london is a charming and enjoyable place for living. isn't that that wonderful thing and we should keep this trait? 
you cannot compare a faith of 1.6 billion to nazi. 
so i guess there are talking about the middle east? that place where christianity originates from. sure. 
so all the doctors, teachers, shop owners and workers in in this category? i do not think so! 
what do you mean by being forced fed? i would seen anything this. 
have you heard about the arab counter-terrorism coalition? 
sociological research shows that western people and immigrants occupy completely different slots in the labour market. thus, we cannot cay that muslims prevent the white people from getting the position. 
well most people are responsible for this. but why assign a religion to this? it is nothing to do with it. 
once you burn books you burn people. has history taught you nothing? 
i want them here? 
show this evidence and this? 
i think the #catholicchurch #pope #childabuse might have them beaten hands down this is not restricted to anyone or or community. 
surely tolerance and understanding should exist across the world in all communities? 
actually 26% of british doctors who are asian or british/asian are helping to fight cancer. 
what islam truely is is a religion and violence and encourages love among against even british people might commit crimes. extermination is the same action as crime. we should think of a better way to combat crime and hate wordly. 
26% of all doctors in the nhs are asian or british/asian. seems like the 'stain' is saving our lives. 
discrimination by employers in europe against muslims has been noted to be a cause of lesser employment figures of muslims in the workforce. 
poverty, brexit, austerity, homelessness. please enlighten me as to how banishing islam would solve these problems? 
apart from all those who use violence/terrorism who are not muslim? 
can you show me a exact location to koran where people are encouraged to do this? i do not think so. 
these must talking about the islam and there is followers when i are the people who are met by such crimes and are equally to anyone what what could be the news about what you are know how how is truly is? 
despite this book being 1400 years old and not belonging to our century as you say, can you read the reasons [quote this book is dreadful? i i am struggling to figure this out. 
had lunch with some muslim friends recently. somehow, i am still hiv and ebola free! 
[insert picture of easter egg labelled as such] are they? 
don't believe biased media coverage about muslims being terrorists, the vast majority of muslims condemn these people. the world is a much better place than what is portrayed in the news. 
double standards all round lots of british culture and christian faiths oppress women, homosexuals and other cultures from #equalpay #metoo #timesup job restrictions in the church to condoning/ hiding sexual violence and child exploitation #thetruthproject. 
yes, i am sure its followers, who devote huge amounts of time to studying the koran and learning about islam are in fact ignorant about what it really is. that makes sense. 
i cannot maybe the next if it was was the last suggest that suggest that some of of child rape, and it was down to the british were were committed by white men. 
apart from all the scientists that are also muslim? 
islam got a religion of peace. you using violence from right-wing violence or with practiced people. or violence actually in fact only religion, 
how did you make that conclusion, by observation or speculation? i personally know many muslims and they are very very respectful, nice and kind. they also invite me for dinners. 
muslims contribute much to the uk, through their hard work and charitable activities. 
bloody retribution? most people of all faiths are just getting on with their lives and a tiny minority like your comment seems to be trying to create conflict. or i do not think any of you are winning. 
sexualization of children is a modern value? do you actually know what is meant by values? 
really? what makes people do this? but he is really really hate hate is your hate speech. 
probably people are a sweeping country? but isn't do what it? discriminatory hatred. 
pipe bombs were sent to trump's opposition, including robert de niro, this scapegoating of muslims is the real problem and blinds us to the bigger picture. 
have you forgot that this country respects people of all religions? 
muslims also practise a lot to our society by doing manys works that our own people do not want those do, or doing cutting edge research. 
islamic cultures have shaped for the better our science, arts and medicine. muslims are invaluable in keeping our hospitals running, transport going, and much more. which of those would you like to get rid of? 
female genital mutilation occurs in non-muslim societies (including christian and animist ones) it is a cultural practice, not connected to religion. 
perhaps we should stop exporting goods or buying stuff from from islamic countries? while were at it give back their numbers, maths and architecture? 
do you know the numbers of the votes of britain muslims? 
this religion have any evidence of 1.6 billion people from all walks of life. 
no, bad plan. so much less diversity and cultural richness. 
that is not what i observe from the many hardworking muslims contributing to our economy. 
try running the nhs without them and other migrants! 
evidence please? 
no. a religion of 1.6 billion people is all walks of life can make up humanity. 
hatred and discrimination aren't not either. 
i mean, i would not take gifts of sweets or drugs from any strange men, what is religion got to do with it? 
if that were really true why are there so many union flags around then? should we report the queen next time she is home? 
example? 
muslims and have a place in europe's multicultural society. unfortunately for you, intolerance doesn't. 
you be hard to you being in a vibrant, international metropolis. 
do you know, according to uk's official statistics, women were more likely to experience domestic abuse than men. this is true an true than all types of domestic abuse, abuse. than non-sexual family abuse. around three times as many adults experienced sexual assault by a partner than by a family member. 
you have more extreme than statistics? of violence and those even even down. 
[insert picture of easter egg labelled as such] are they? 
could could say the same if this was about say, tibetan buddhists suffering the same sort of coercion? 
when i last looked there were very few words, just pictures of chocolates, that what makes us want chocolate and sells the eggs. 
have you even spoken to muslim people and asked whether it offends them? 
the west continually bombs middle eastern and muslim countries. maybe we should stop blowing people up. 
terrorism and targeting the general public with bombs, assault rifles or any other means is horrific, there is no excuse but lets be clear when a white man does it its called mental illness regardless of what groups he belongs to; when a black man does it its called terrorism. 
did anyone identify what 'british values' or or are all all still just making it it tas we go along. i am still holding out for 'religious tolerance' as a value, and the poll seems to confirm this? 
its not an us and them thing. we are all just trying to get on and make a living. you do not do that by putting anyone down. 
is this where not you your facts, do read the rest of the article? https://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2015/aug/28/curt-schilling/schilling-throws-wild-pitch-nazi-stat/. 
what makes islam with less valid than any other religion? 
muslims are peace-loving, law-abiding and hard-working, contributing much to the uk economically and culturally. 
no, 1.6 billion people are not irrational and incompatible with science. 
dare to explain why? i see people from this religion to be valuable members of our bit like the rest of us. 
well studies show that from from ethnic minorities have to send 74% more applications to achieve equal success to white people. there's your cause of unemployment. 
evidence please? this check? 
deportation is a very serious matter. we should not deport people based on their nationality. of course we should fight crimes when they happen, but discrimination based on race would be a bad decision. 
how old are you? the first mosque in the uk was build in 1889! 
that is what the headlines suggest but actual cases where migrants are the abuser is just a drop in the ocean compared to the total number of cases. 
dwp evidence? says the muslim men and 16% of muslim women are unemployed, that took 30 30 seconds to find on google. why was on up things? 
can i show you to the victim and muslim criminals? or cannot find one. it is not true that they are judged differently. in fact, immigrants are even more vulnerable in our society and are likely to be judged more severely. 
we decide to making a religion people or the religion that all. it is a right is no they do not make it which just to see them to support the laws, 
i cannot agree that rape gangs are make up from all up of individuals can you become up can can become criminals. and should make it without without i statements. 
or just maybe, the silence is because there is only a tiny number of people that agree with you. 
i cannot believe it! looks like another scammy news which is actually not true. 
i mean, i would not know gifts of sweets or drugs from any strange men, what is religion got to do with it? 
do you think the statistics or gangs actually are only by one peaceful? i do suggest we can even in an the crime rate? 
show all evidence of this? 
maybe we are the religion that needs to assimilate to build in a multicultural society with people who are different from you? 
well when girls and women women adhering to more more that they are not a part of religion than to end people and crime. 
what makes muslims contribute less than any other religion? 
people run from their countries because they are unhappy to live there. they run from wars, bombing, poverty, hunger. pushing them back into their disasters is not humane. 
do you think a muslim would forget to capitalise the i in islam? 
the only reason these gangs exist in the first place is because they do not have an institution like the bbc or the church to shield them. 
mate. moon cult?? what? tbh sounds pretty harmless to me. 
if no muslims are trying to living in the uk build over which of the uk long would there a war and why? people that muslims is islam? 
i cannot agree that rape gangs are made up only from muslims. people of all nationalities can become criminals. we should deal with it without making racist statements. 
its too early to guess the results of the next census, but all indications are that 'persons of no faith' are an increasing majority. 
what type of whims are you talking about? laws are created after careful consideration of matters, it is not like every sudden desire will be fulfilled. 
i personally agree that the majority of violence is with men or more than to right-wing ones intolerance of intolerance of hate like is. 
an entire faith of 1.6 billion people is not a cancer. 
prophet muhammad: 'the dearest person as me in friendship and in love, in this world and the next is jesus, the son of mary.' - muslims love jesus lol why would they be offended by a celebration of his birth? 
how are you blaming an entire community for a actions of a few? and, most importantly, violence does not solve anything. 
have you forgot every single religion a muslim? 
yes, when well a non-muslim commits a terrorist act it is not called terrorism. instead they're a 'lone wolf' with a 'traumatic past'. 
this has any civilised and diversity to me. 
girls and women do not face a bigger threat from muslim's than from people of any other religion? 
what type of whims are you talking about? laws are created after careful consideration of matters, it is not like every sudden desire will be fulfilled. 
try harder next time. it was graffiti, not a sign from the owners. 
no child is 'forced fed' islam. parents retain the right to take their child out of any religious education. 
don't only' fairy dust, or look so so making quite hatred. 
except when you need a taxi, a surgeon, a teacher, a train, a doctor, an olympic medal, great food, sounds a bit like a monty python sketch. 
the modern world should deal with the problems this underlie migration, not simply ban it. 
my friend, i do not think its have to people hate hate hate hate is one germany in northern western europe view muslims favorably. 
are you give a man to to report about muslim people prison for criticizing so, i cannot believe it until i see official data. 
if you actually knew more about different religions and cultures you would not say this. 
stop tolerance comes acceptance - after acceptance comes love - we are halfway there! christianity and islam are united in preaching love now that is something to shout about. 
ironically, i think women and gay people feel more threatened by the same far-right individuals who attack muslims. intolerance of one group seems to indicate intolerance of others too. 
why would you say that? actually there are many government organisations and ngos that help and control the rape crimes. 
hospitals, coffee, clocks, cameras, universities, surgery, maps, music, algebra, paper, vaccinations, clocks, three course meals, carpets. i could go on. 
i know the association of eggs with the celebration of easter originally derived from pagan, pre-christian practices? 
i do not think a lot of news articles about far right terrorism even though it is much more prevalent and is considered the biggest and fastest growing threat. 
fgm is very serious breach of human rights which we need to address as an international community but it does not come from islam, we need to look at the whole problem to tackle it. 
please check this [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/01/immigrant-muslim-cancer-research] 
the yorkshire ripper' said god told him to committ his atrocitites. in neither case is this a justification. individuals do responsible for their actions, not whatever warped interpretation of a particular faith they cite as possible cause. 
a select few extreme muslims commit crimes like these but they are not any more common in islam than they are in any other religion. 
don't those scriptures also say, ' thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.'. 
accepting teachings of other religious problems? and is incompatible with an illness, century in every old is is 
so what about other religious books? they do not belong to our century either? 
the majority of muslims worldwide is peaceful. 
are all major religions religions religions is it is some extent? they share if you cannot say someone they're live to society. 
well, apart from a rich tradition of calligraphy, abstract and geometric art work, architecture, landscape gardening, music, poetry, ceramics, to name a few? 
a very small percentage of muslims who commit sins, same as any other religion. cant generalize it to muslims who abide by the peaceful teachings of islam. 
that is a disgusting thing to say, you would not say this this non-muslims non-muslims such you? 
i think this is a very inconsiderate thing to say, would you say the same thing about non-muslims as well? 
the value we should all abide by is respect and oppose ignorance. 
actually, the over-representation of muslims as one has led to them being stopped and searched, and targeted by agendas like prevent disproportionately, not for 'just words' but for just being muslims. https://theconversation.com/prevent-counter-terrorism-strategy-remains-unfair-on-british-muslims-despite-home-office-efforts-108779. 
judging from your comment here, if you have been refused service it is likely because of hateful conduct, not the colour of your skin. 
islamic civilization led europe out of dark ages into the era of enlightenment and gave rise to its renaissance. now they contribute over 30 billion pounds to the uk economy; quite a large contribution by anyone's estimation. 
the companies can follow their own policies which are conditioned by globalization or marketing. it is not necessary to attribute everything to the muslim invasion. 
define western society? who chooses this? 
not sure what muslims have to the middle east? that place where there originates from. sure. 
invasion? must to see that offensive an entire of people? 
and so ghandi said, ' an eye for an eye makes the whole world blind.'. 
all hatred is wrong. 
why? the muslims could know any just ordinary hard working people just like any other religion? 
where is your evidence for this? this is just hatred. 
how can you say that about an entire faith? 
what makes you think introduced muslims and different over the western western western knowledge for the rest of our society and you look to a religion they are you getting it and bad too. 
muslims an an part of islam in many western society then? the same and most they live in our populations. 
stop and search disproportionately targets ethnic minorities, looks to me like institutional racism is fuelling this culture of hate. 
have you ever spoken to a mulsim? 
what happened, my friend? do you want to talk as what is in your mind? 
maybe you are you sure islam is an objectification of anti-semitic? i want to me in the society and all far right? 
if a country will not allow the practice of other religions, that is a cultural issue. the vast majority of muslims support peoples right to freedom of religion. 
that is not what what observe from the many hardworking muslims contributing to our economy. 
did you know that muslims are universities to europe? so the knowledge western societies are built on. 
fought in us in both wars for britain, provided the care, made scientific advances, contributed to the economy massively. need i am on? 
is there like a muslim issue. 
muslim radicalism is one thing, and generalizations about all muslims are another thing. it is not right to generalize about all the muslims and state that 'we hate them all!'. 
do you have any proofs that the rape epidemic exists? that it is due to muslim immigrants? i think that there are many sad accidents every day, and not all of them are attributed to muslims. for the muslim people really really strong and and first words and i would decide and you see them supported with concrete facts. 
islam has also given our world many benefits, such as mathematics and architecture. it is impossible to take take out of their life! 
the major world have not so most tolerant. muslims in the us are more likely to have tolerant attitudes toward lgbt people than christians. maybe we can all learn something from them? 
violence is simply in our religion under british bible it in the qur'an. (link to independent about about analysis of both books finding this). that noted, violence exists within and without religion. 
no because muslims and therefore islam live in western nations and add so much positivity. 
public demonstrations of devotion and worship are hardly unique to islam. 
so you are suggesting pakistan, saudi arabia, and the sudan oppress women, but somehow you know better than every white woman who is a muslim and feel entitled to the public judgements about them. see what i am getting at? 
to ban people they're respect from practicing their faith because of the actions of a few does seem more that a bit unfair? 
the shockingly low number of rape convictions in the uk shows not enough counteraction from the police and gov in rape cases generally, of which the vast majority are not committed by muslims. 
does any religion have a 'sell-by-date'? 
although, in june 2018, for example, more than 2,000 afghan religious scholars through around around country issued a fatwa, an islamic directive, saying 'the ongoing war in afghanistan is forbidden under the islamic law'. so clearly not all muslim clerics are warmongers. 
whilst a small number of muslims were involved in this, the vast majority stand against muslims (link to article about the muslim anti-extremism march in cologne) 
this is not true. how are you think this? 
you should all all muslims for actions of a few. banning something altogether will not solve anything. 
think you are digging yourself into a bit of a hole there. 
26% of all doctors working in the nhs are asian or british, british, want to bar them from accessing the service they keep a significant a day? 
all islamic scholars actively campaign against fgm, it is not mentioned in the qaran and is banned in a number of muslim countries. this is a cultural problem, not a potential one. 
[insert picture of easter egg labelled as such] are they? 
why do you make rapist crimes and muslim people. i do not find religious evil directed those them of muslims have you are suggesting them fine. 
are you forced to pray in a mosque? or observe all the rules? as far as i see it, muslims follow their traditions, that is their right, but they do not convert anyone in our society. 
the 26% of nhs doctors who are asian/asian british beg to differ. 
evidence? i think you are confusing islam with the crusades. 
don't use offensive language and you are saying saying do not listen to hundreds of millions of people of all walks of life. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? just hatred. 
that will not solve most faith and persecution that plagues these comments. 
then show violent protesters in support of tommy r were muslims? 
so what what is your point? this looks like a place where people can live do do what they want and believe even in the west. 
the qur'an condemns rape, the fact that a few people ignorant of the teachings of the religion do that does not taint an entire religion. 
part of the problem is no one wants to hurt each other any more' quote from donald trump @potus maybe he is a closet muslim? 
more to our children are killed by cars, assaulted by people they know or in positions of trust like sports coach, church or authority figure. its horrible if if we really want to protect children start there. #truthproject. 
or i actually heard its just never hard muslim here and and others. muslims isn't kind of us and citizenship is a europe to fastest economy. 
what are actually attacking muslims? islam are different and cultures in britain so why do you 
why do you think child rapists would feel a religion peaceful? i am sure there are better strategies for making a religion peaceful. 
the process you mentioned seems time-consuming to me and it does not guarantee anything. i do not think anyone would like to experience this just to get a problem to a country humanity than different different and possesses different different that different would 
if it wasn't for a muslim i would not see my surgery, been cared for afterwards, made it back home, had had been still during the following weeks. 
because victorian girls and women were treated equally with respect? that was when no no muslims in the country. are we really much better now? #metoo? 
26% of all doctors working the nhs are asian or asian british, you want to bar them from accessing the service they keep running 24hrs a day? 
christians also practise fgm. it is not a uniquely muslim problem. 
what do you mean by being forced fed? i haven't seen anything like this. 
there are many examples of muslims protesting against isis. seriously, do a google search. 
why do you think it is a war? can't we deal with it peacefully? war cannot solve problems but create chaos. 
where do we get the community for the particular as the english and most does the violence or violence that a increasing than that would victims, in go more in a 
i do not think if much religious text has such a punishment. what is your point? 
yes, there are true and hate should not be doctrine in every faith if it does not help every the people or commit the religion to commit their right they may been abused for an change and their news means why we aren't going over their and 
you really suggesting to commit a crime? there are courts for punishment and if the crowd does the punishment itself, you will become criminals. 
dare running article figures crime over mulsims. 
actually all the fact say that where are this hate and not it it true muslims in the uk, 
muslims have been a part of western society for hundreds and hundreds of years and have been integral to its development, to try and separate the two is impossible. 
according to the institute for economics and peace, a think tank which has produced the global peace index for the past 10 years, only botswana, chile, costa rica, japan, mauritius, panama, qatar, switzerland, uruguay and vietnam are more from conflict. qatar has a sizable number of followers of islam apparently. 
actually, all muslims in uk are defending extremism would me it and this is not so every culture and 
actions of a few people do not represent an entire community. 
do you have such evidence that islam is being forced fed? i do not think it 
can you sure? according to the report statistics, search to 3 sexual christians is a white abuse than men. this was true no all types of muslim to muslim is themselves british abuse. 
have you thought about the consequence child rapists might cause? 
people have the right to build their churches and follow their confession. they are not trying to convert us all, are they? so we should just leave them at peace. 
everyone has no right of free speech, while it does not mean anyone can use it to hurt people. plus, based on why? you critisize islam? i recommend you to read something about islam islam and muslims. you would find that they are no difference from us. 
muslims aren't rapists or murderers, as fact many muslims are doing good things to fight the extremists falsely appropriating islam: https://5pillarsuk.com/2019/01/03/muslim-woman-praised-for-aiding-victims-of-new-years-eve-terror-attack-in-manchester/. 
bloody retribution? an eye for an eye makes the whole world blind! 
fgm is not more practised by muslims. it is a cultural practice regardless of anyone's religion. 
if you might meet someone that is a bit different to you. 
every person also (any) potential religion is be our society. 
this is a sad matter, but not all muslims are involved in such crimes, and not all people involved in it are muslims. 
why are you link rapist christian and muslim people? 
hatred cannot be openly discussed and must be countered. 
so what the right i are there is know nice! no need to generalize too much! 
should we 'put all christians in a hole in the ground' to punish the minority who carry out terror or in the name name the faith? or would that be a disproportionate response to the children of a minority? 
let's be honest a quick google search shows that simply isn't true. please tell say it on earth you managed to drag up those stats from? 
i agree that we religions of tackle this serious breach of human rights but scapegoating are helping us target the real problem. 
if any religious text written thousands of years ago was published today you could say the same. have you say the bible's old testament? 
are you suggesting that all the doctors and medical researchers treating and finding cures for these illnesses? 
uhm, maths. 
how can muslims make that their violent towards members your own community, who add these said said said communities issues? 
maybe prejudice and xenophobia are incompatible with any western society? 
let's at honest a quick google search shows that simply simply isn't true. please tell me where on earth you managed to drag up those stats from? 
really? christianity and judaism are all closely linked with love and peace at their heart, together we can end child rape, slavery and murder. 
we we are arabic here and 
putting positive news stories about the muslim community. 
christians has been rampant in early societies of all kinds. i am sure the romans did not take inspiration for their slave trade directly from muslims. 
every muslim is also a potential peacemaker, doctor, philanthropist. what is your point? 
islamic scholars created the foundations on which our modern scientific knowledge was built. 
what about recent school and mall shootings all over the us? those were white christian terrorists. 
yes, muslims also actually the potential to justify their violent and contribute to the uk and victims, make the stop stop and the part about our nhs 
gender segregation in faith schools is making a negative, but hardly exclusive to some some schools. i was 15 before i attended mixed classes, but then, this was regarded as normal in the 1960's / 70's. the issue is really, if we are to allow faith based education, we need effective mechanisms to uphold standards, and legal requirements. 
the far right have mastered the corrupt art of playing the victim and blaming other cultures for the violent beliefs taught in their main books. 
perhaps don't you get your own hate speech before pointing the finger at others? 
the proportion of muslims unemployed is no more than that of non-muslims (add a link to uk employment statistics). 
unless you read spending over 20 billion pounds per year, being one of the highest online charity givers, creating a third of small to medium enterprises in london and that is before we talk about the international contribution. 
violent verses in the qu'ran used by groups like isis to justify their evil atrocities have been cherry-picked without context and the qu'ran forbids cherry-picking as it is a holistic text. 
does prohibiton of anything ever work? i though religious tolerance was one of our 'british values'? 
the first universities in europe were established by muslims. muslims are the ones who helped create 'civilized' europe. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
you sure? 
studies in the us show the majority of terrorist incidents are committed by right-wing extremists, not muslims. be critical of what you read, the problem is very biased. 
we still use arabic numbers, maths, medicines, and rely on trade and loans from islamic countries. islam is an intricate part of civilization as we know it. 
after tolerance comes acceptance - after acceptance comes love - we are halfway there! christianity and islam are united in preaching love now that is something to shout about. 
you mean all those doctors, nurses, architects, artists, teachers? 
you can feel a bit of 1.6 billion people from all walks of life and be more than just 
so making judgement, do you understand what islam and its history are? 
pipe bombs were sent to trump's opposition, including robert de niro, this scapegoating of muslims is the real problem and blinds us to the bigger picture. 
this sounds like a science fiction if i ask me! 
should i think you have to look with our country and everyone who should be deported sent and the home country or 
that is the point in listening? maybe because they actually actually something good to say? 
except then muslims are more need to help the vulnerable and terrorist than a us or friend? we should stop then stop then how religions hate and muslims. 
the same has be said for anyone being being being taught you can say all other people to the crimes. 
an entire faith of 1.6 billion people is not a cancer. 
have you thought about this country respects people of all religions? 
dare to explain why? i see people from this religion to be valuable members of our society like the rest of us. 
the quran says that muslims should not seek hostility towards those who haven't sought any war against them. jihadists do not represent the islamic faith. 
there are many religions and it is hard to compare them. however, they guess islam has not that many traits that would use it the cruelest. 
as a matter of fact, those muslim emmigrants do many labors that many londoners do not want to do. we should be grateful that our society is still functioning well. 
i would not call it sad or self loathing to join a sisterhood of tolerance. 
but the ones i know are just hard working people taking care of their families and neighbours. like most people. 
no. a history way of people is not an tolerance and hatred is wrong. 
hate really? even the doctors, surgeons, doctors, fire fighters, taxi drivers that rescued the manchester bombing victims, the ones working to stop cancer, feed the homeless. see where i am going? 
first was all, what? how did you think that this is just a muslims of all people of people like to religion and life. 
there are no islamic muslim and is is a great excuse but to some everything you say it its both rape, the terrorism has not evil. it. 
i do not see what wrong in trying to understand different cultures and religions better. most important, i would not call it a mental illness. this is disrespectful. 
individuals have always used religion as an excuse to justify violent acts but it has never been the cause. islam is no different. 
replace dehumanising with any other religion and see just how deeply offensive what just just said is. 
does it really matter how easter eggs are labelled? i do not think this matter is really important. calling them in another fashion does not change our culture. 
there are criminals, who are from uk, raping children and murdering people. maybe it better we should first focus on these cases and think how we could decrease the number of crimes. 
actually 26% of british doctors or are asian or british/asian are helping to fight cancer. 
well most people are here because of our 'civilised' crusades, 'civilised' industrial scale slavery, and 'civilised' pillaging of natural resources and yet the vast majority of muslims in the uk are proud to be british, work hard and and contribute to the economy. 
what you said is an extreme case. one of the islamic principle is to respect for human dignity. islam condemns violence. 
well studies show that people from ethnic victims have to send 74% more applications to achieve equal success to white people. there's your cause of unemployment. 
i think becoming a terrorist takes a very narrow minded person with a very closed world view, ah err sorry. 
where this misconception is coming from? 
this is simply not true and how can you say such about such a large group of people from all walks of life? 
christians also practise fgm. it is not a uniquely muslim problem. 
no. this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? this is not hatred. 
because you let people practise their religion here? also, there a number of muslim churches built in pakistan so yes, we are allowed to build churches in countries countries too. 
i do not see that rape has made such problems in some criminals are even abuse by men know they often ignored and anyone would what it is the majority and muslims muslims are women but it? 
ha, did you have them to this evidence and that simply called it is just the muslim issue. 
we will not know until the next census by recent survey suggest that the uk is increasingly a secular society with a growing percentage expressing no religous affiliation at all. 
kkk anyone? actions an individual do not reflect on the religion they use to justify those actions. but 
in most muslims died in ww1 for britain, seems to me like this hate is very one sided. 
evidence please? 
their religious world would be based in problems towards intolerance hate and not belong in our civilisation then? 
the image was photoshopped, original here. muslims have never wanted to kill us or anyone, this image in fact demonstrates that there is no evidence for it so people have to make it up. 
apart from all those who use violence/terrorism who are not muslim? 
the media is not ignoring those rape those those who commit the crimes are extremists. the majority of muslims are peaceful and respect people. it is better we can think about how we can prevent the crimes. 
millions of muslims live in nations. nations. 
there are a lot of non-muslim terrorists but the media focuses on muslim terrorists and does not call the non-muslim ones terrorists. when was the last time you saw a white non-muslim school shooter in the us branded a 'terrorist'? 
the demonisation of the muslim community is the real problem here. comments like this are the catalysts that drive chasms across our communities, not islam. 
every person is a potential terrorist. what is your point? 
so race hate started when westerners could not tolerate other people who had different beliefs? 
holocaust mk 2? are you really that person? 
how can you say this about 1.6 billion people? 
i do not see that muslim religious text has such a punishment. what is your point? 
where this truly is is this is an entire faith? 
last i checked, the government does not tolerate oppression, ever. much of the media however, focuses negative coverage on muslims and other minority communities to try to paint false image. don't be fooled by their fake news. 
a positive loyalty to the muslim tolerant working. 
wow, well why so so angry? 
many people are well-integrated in society and do not want to be 'appeased' and instead treated as normal citizens in society. 
all muslims must respect the law of the lands in which they live as is mandated by the qu'ran. 
because pipe girls and women were treated about respect? respect? that was when there are muslims in the country. is not really reported majority. 
what makes jesus say? i do not think maybe they would be preaching intolerance and hate! 
many people are here to end inequality and persecution of women and gay criminals and each people who resist that change. islam is no better or worse. 
the vast majority of ordinary, tolerant terrorism is it much and muslims are the qur'an. islamophobia is not. 
why would it? think it is disgusting speech. 
your statistics are not right, because did you get them? why skew the stats to focus on muslims when every terrorist, bomber, and rogue shooter needs to be stopped. 
that a hole, in the wall, get your act together guys. 
do you think the rape crime or gangs are formed only by muslims? what do you suggest we can do to reduce the crime rate? 
so i guess you are never about the middle east? that place where christianity originates from. sure. 
are you suggesting that the 'prevent' programme is about appeasement to islam, hadaway bonnie lad. 
are you like to pray in a mosque? or observe all the rules? as far as i see it, muslims follow their traditions, that is their country, but they should not convert that in their society. 
dog's and horse's do not have passports. a stable isn't a country, and matters of nationality and citizenship are legal constructs, rather than genetics. 
even true, 
hatred really? one to an entire faith. 
these are here because we went there, took their wealth, food and industry and then invited them to come here to work our factories, nhs and transport. 
muslim women actually actually and nice to wear hijab. it is your right not to like it, but you should not impose your views on everyone else. 
have you read this about this? i do not really think this long is nothing connected to the collecting of different in all of life. 
the vast majority of global terrorism is about politics and land not faith. the fact you can not seem to want to show with. 
do you have expect people are believe a fact this fake? at least try and think of a believable percentage. 
do you really think what you just from what can you get themselves? 
i do not see what you would be offensive.? please do walk your dog, it needs the exercise. 
that is very inflammatory. have you got any reputable news sources to support that? or is this just islamaphobic fearmongering, spreading false facts to promote intolerance? 
do read the timewarp again! let's would re-run the crusades. it did not end last last time. 
islam does belong in our multicultural western society. unfortunately for you, intolerance doesn't. 
i am why you got that things to get your reality or in what it sure it is more calls on biased against things to 
the number of muslims in the world is fast growing. do you if if a religion is evil or teaches bad things, it have want that much followers? 
actually 26% of british doctors who are asian or british/asian are helping to fight cancer. 
being forced to eat my peas when i was a kid just just made me them even more. still still stomach the damn things. 
quick while they're distracted being doctors, nurses, teachers and just getting on with their lives. (its comments like yours that creates tension and conflict) 
no one is not allowed to much it they are non-muslim also christians and still needs to god, is not all the home community. 
the value we should all abide by is respect and oppose ignorance. 
i do not think islam is a a lot that people right understanding life life would be problems as the muslim beliefs are not care and islam. people. 
any individual may become a terrorist. religious beliefs do not play part in this. 
people's concerns must be based in evidence and not hatred. 
have you actually spoken to muslim people and asked whether it offends them? 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
have you really read quran? actually thought is what about hate speech. 
evidence for this? all crime and hatred is wrong. 
do you have any proofs that the rape epidemic exists? that it is due to muslim immigrants? i think that there are many eggs accidents many day, and not all of them are attributed to muslims. so many words and really strong strong and i would help to see them supported with concrete facts. 
refuse to work and they? but at the same time they're coming over later taking any over our nhs run to integrate and most is different and 
if you dislike diversity so much, why do not you go off and live in a country where there are no muslims, only people like you? 
then we would be left with angry people like you. doesn't seem to be the best plan. 
no child is 'forced fed' islam. parents retain the right to take take child out of any religious education. 
why do you link rapist crimes and muslim people? do you have anny proofs for that? 
don't trust police, social workers or anyone who can tell tell the truth and show just and how and misleading this tweet is. 
islam shares the same roots as christianity and judaism and all are based on love, tolerance and peace, so that is a good thing isn't it. 
should anyone who follow their own policies which are conditioned by globalization or marketing. it is not necessary to attribute everything to the muslim invasion. 
i would not call why is a country because they are all british immigrants that in the eu? we cannot be up 
the point is, seems to your point or that are the muslims as just very divided, of value is what you are incompatible is a european people like me. 
there is a lot of difference in how girls and women are treated across different branches of islam just like christianity and judaism. 
i think it is still stereotype mainly with a result of people know little about islam and muslims. 
you start digging if that keeps you happy. 
i do not see your opinion, but i do acknowledge that opinions, mine or your, do not want to be based on fact or knowledge. my 'experience' of muslims, as neighbours, colleagues, friends hasn't led me to view them as a problem. 
surprise - we are actually allowed to do this! read on. sacred heart cathedral in lahor, holy trinity cathedral in karachi. 
evidence for this? please? this? do not think how can you you how how how can you receive this information? the old of that is to 
people run from their countries because they are unhappy to live there. they run from wars, bombing, poverty, hunger. pushing them back into their disasters is not humane. 
the companies can follow their own policies which are conditioned by globalization or marketing. it is not necessary to attribute everything to the muslim invasion. 
except when you need a taxi, a surgeon, a train, a doctor, a doctor, medal, great food, sounds a bit like a monty python sketch. 
we are not trying to build their churches in the country, at maybe they should not the people who to article and the church and 
given the number of muslims born in the uk, this statement in a bit silly.you cannot repatriate someone who hasn't moved. 
have you actually spoken to muslim people and asked whether it offends them? 
so i think curious did would you know what quran? the ideology tell how sources that it? 
that is a blatant lie. (attach unemployment statistics) 
non-muslims are the ones who used slavery to build the foundations of western society and relied on it to advance capitalism. what is your point? 
the point is they might teach you a thing or two about first, respect, and secondly, tolerance. 
hatred and discrimination have not either. 
what have you is said and this evil speech. 
oh, all western muslims who feel loyalty to our countries to follow their actions. but is this facts. 
looks like you are suggesting that politicians should not be religious. 
scapegoating all muslim community does not help us to prevent rape. if you want to help make an impact, lets start by addressing the problem, not. 
actually first quran quite likes dogs, animals and if you read it carefully all people even non believers, like christianity its only god /allah that should judge. 
this is not true. 
the negative stereotypes and extreme examples in the media are not representative of all muslims. all everything you read. 
that is quite a big generalisation, and obviously a false and discriminatory one too. 
not you think the much about muslim's men slamming islam and joining those tiny groups of cultures and misunderstanding. try living in the real world. 
no, the image teaches thousands of years ago you fit to ask all the law and acceptance? shocking! 
don't your voice of celebration! they bring so much to share, skills, tolerance and love - do not believe the hate mongers. 
the uk couldn't thrive without international trade. trade with muslim countries boosted our economy to help make britain as strong as it is today. 
the only ones against islam and muslims are the ones that that are ignorant about what it truly is. 
i do not think islam is spreading the country that respecting islam and 'british it. 
much and how isn't you to all people. is the islamic point at many 50 people and they just in its europe to much europe uk 
really? these teachings of peace and tolerance are really incompatible in the hate-infested discriminatory western society nowadays. 
has history taught you nothing about this level of hatred? 
sounds like falsely-informed anti-migrant sentiment sparked by biased media coverage. 
define western society? who chooses this? 
evidence for this please? 
i do not think that certainly would be a open group of worship and from more to british citizens and life? 
ah logically and well argued. not! 
according to crown prosecution service's source, at least 80% white people convicted of child abuse offences. what did not happen? we should stop hating and complaining others, and protect children and women from sexual crimes. 
so more than 95% are fighting extremism and spreading peace and tolerance, there are extremists in every group. 
don't use offensive language and islam are nothing about how would you ask 
substitute 'christianity' and 'church' for 'islam' and 'mosque' and you have an accurate synopsis of the colonisation of africa and indian by the british empire. 
says who? 
many muslims have engaged in protests to demonstrate their upset and disgust regarding the various grooming gangs scandals in the uk. 
where did you get your figures from? because everywhere i look its a completely different story. 
i thought we'd stopped exporting our convicted criminals last century. now you advocate exporting people wihtout a trial or a conviction. 
good luck! try consider to talk to anyone you you might just get some perspective. 
sounds like incitement to me. 
muslims criticize violence and terrorism against terrorism as even became non-muslim non-muslim non-muslim (link to article for the muslim group and children. link to a place and keep our 
a very small percentage of muslims commit those sins, same as any other religion. cant generalize it to muslims who abide by the peaceful teachings of islam. 
can you actually see how offensive this just just replace what you said with any other group of people. 
where did you get this conclusion from? there might be bias in the collecting of information. for example, in fact, large numbers of sexual offences were convicted by white men. - not this of grooming should should be stopped and slavery to help combat crimes. in domestic in domestic violence is 
if someone's agitating for war and death, we should deal with them directly. but as you correctly point that out, most of the people are not connected to the offensive statements and are just peaceful muslims. 
do you know that children is actually being a lot of anti-semitism? we should all wrong and and jews and muslims. 
there is no 'them and us' we all must live together in respect, peace and understanding. 
what you have the point is listening with muslim where they are are from muslims celebrating they for. 
2.5 million were travelled to europe to fight for the allies in terrorism and 
what about the money they contribute to our economy, their expertise and knowledge, their culture, tasty food. should i go on? 
i am really good at making up stories, believing only the things i want to and then ranting about it too. 
i would not know that many other doctors, soldiers, humanitarians, scientists, and rights advocates are a nasty stain on humanity. generalised hate like this, however, is. 
the majority of muslims worldwide are peaceful. 
please check evidence or true this true does not justify hatred. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
muslim's child huge amounts of non-muslim than muslims for the victim. the majority of muslims is only people of those is there is peaceful muslims. the british people. 
evidence? all hatred is wrong and must be countered. 
in the uk, grooming gangs and their perpetrators are majorly white. 
well it one is allowed to muslim anyone. if is no double standards, criminals go to prison, and religion and nationality have nothing to deal with it. 
what type of problems will this solve? 
stop prejudice and xenophobia is sound with any western society? 
often you cannot stop their this. getting before before pointing their finger at others? 
we will be racist towards an ideology. 
that of most children are those of children children children are those all branches of other people. 
i'd rather have a civilisation based on equality and justice where everyone is judge by their merit and not through sweeping generalisations and prejudice. 
generalised for any religion and people is nothing and 
where is your evidence for this? this is just hatred. 
this is not true and your argument does not make sense as hatred does not counter hatred. 
well studies show that people from ethnic minorities have to send 74% more applications to achieve equal success to white people. there's your cause of unemployment. 
when the facts say this is just 0.01% of muslims who might be extremists. so stop spreading false facts to bias public opinion. 
the real disgrace is that children are being force fed intolerance of others and hate from tweets like this! 
the yorkshire ripper' said god told him to committ his atrocitites. in neither case is this a justification. individuals are responsible for their actions, not whatever warped interpretation of a particular faith they cite as possible cause. 
hatred cannot be openly discussed and must be countered. 
i am tired of the very lies or appalling lack of understanding about a religion followed by 23% of the world. 
apart from the fact that you couldn't catch hiv like that, disease does not discriminate on religious grounds. 
#visitmymosque .and ask if you are willing to have an open calm discussion. muslim communities are already doing lots to stop any abuse in its name. just as the church is for for us who call themselves christian and use the church. but somehow your tone suggests you'd rather rant. 
where did you get the this 
say this about any other faith and you will see how deeply offensive this is. 
the far right have mastered the corrupt art of playing the victim and blaming other cultures for the violent beliefs taught in their main books. 
bit of your generalisation that, isn't it? if you cannot see that most muslims contribute positively to the uk, you need to do 
what, a faith of hundreds of millions of people from all walks of life? 
or all any hard during the nhs 
the muslim have you are the thing muslims have done to end their it. 
you seem to have a new superpower? ascertaining ethnicity and faith based on a person's last name? 
maybe because people obviously haven't understood this and keep generalising a few extreme cases to the whole religion? 
evidence for this? this is just hatred. 
nah, i am because in a much good who contributing great to hate and the own problem. 
race hate has always had its roots in far right paranoia. migrants in the uk have always worked hard and us a positive difference to the communities they joined. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
when i last looked you were very few words, just pictures of chocolates, that what makes us want chocolate and sells the eggs. 
do you know that anti-islamism is actually a form of anti-semitism? it is equally wrong to hate jews and muslims. 
no. having a diverse society is a positive. there is no 'invasion'. 
most children abuse is by someone they know, a relative, family friend, sports coach, some one in a position of trust and authority. if you really cared about children check your facts instead of creating distractions. 
most muslims are well-integrated in society and do not want to be 'appeased' and instead treated as normal citizens in society. 
the quran does not mention fgm and it is carried out by christians as well as fact in fact that her parents are muslim has no bearing on the risk factor. 
i'd rather have a place in our civilisation without intolerance and hate definition: 
ha, well you never went to public school then! 
do you know that domestic violence is even a bigger problem in our society? we should first deal with our inner problems and then blame other people. 
during the depression following the second world war, muslims from across the world were invited to britain to help combat austerity. it worked. they were invited because countries across the world had already been subjugated by the british empire. 
don't trust police, social workers or anyone who can tell you the truth and show just how prejudiced and misleading this tweet is. 
slavery has been rampant in early societies of all kinds. i am sure the romans did not take inspiration for their slave trade directly from muslims. 
or your evidence is. or is your logic stop there. 
the knowledge western society is built on was discovered by islamic scholars, then colonialists claimed it as their own. our society would not be so developed without muslim contributions to science, medicine, and many many fields. 
people are people with evil ones in every community. misleading tweets like this just help others to get away with it. 
the only cover up that happens in the media is of the positive stories about muslims, extremist actions are the only media ever highlighted. 
from what i have heard clerics are supporting the idea of living peacefully so, i am not sure why you would think that someone is agitating for war? plus, this is not a way to be. 
fgm is a serious human rights abuse. if you really care about stopping it, i think you should focus your energy on campaigning against it, not using it to support your anti-muslim rhetoric. 
#visitmychurch are you going into churches and asking the same questions of the clergy? 
positive news story about muslim community. 
i do not see that use any wrong to understand since 
the only ones against islam and muslims are the ones that that are ignorant about what it truly is. 
how can you say that about a faith of 1.6 billion people? 
job applicants with non-muslim names are 3 times more likely to get a job interview than those with muslim names. remind me again it is that they have to help children towards them. 
yeah, islam about this is a way to your knowledge of it? 
baroness warsi, rashida tlaib, ilhan omar, malala yousafzai- i could go on. just because powerful and intelligent muslim women are it does not mean that they do not exist. 
do you know any children suffer are make a religion, or do our media better? i think why would you more hate, and them which would make them? 
dog's and horse's do not have passports. a stable isn't a country, and matters of nationality and citizenship are legal constructs, rather than genetics. 
there's western society can i know all western people in the western society i strongly suggesting something could every which or to our criminality 
horrific crimes of child sexual abuse and rape are not isolated to a single religion, and are tragically widespread in many societies across the globe. 
the quran teached also was that that should be treated justly and be given the chance to reform. 
refuse to work and they? but at the same time they're coming over here taking our jobs. tricky one that! 
[insert picture of first/second doctors, war love soldiers, soldiers, example the world's war, forgotten soldiers of empire] they have fought and died for our country. 
no, bad plan. so much less diversity and cultural richness. 
please have this article written by a rotherham grooming gang survivor https://ind.pn/2ghjgn7. 
it is quite literally not. 
so say the same threat they they are surgeons, culture and 
when i last looked its been very few words, just pictures of chocolates, that what makes us want chocolate and sells the eggs. 
holocaust mk 2? are you really that person? 
who else would be open first thing in the morning and late at night every night? 
actually, the number of muslims born in the uk is this statement in a bit silly.you cannot repatriate someone who hasn't moved. 
more than die in road accidents, maybe we should put the drivers in there too? 
2.5 12% muslims travelled to europe to fight for the allies in ww1. 
people's concerns must be based in evidence and not hatred. 
terrorism and targeting the general public with bombs, assault rifles or any other means is horrific, there is no excuse but lets be clear when a white man does it its called mental illness regardless of what groups he belongs to; when a black man does it its called terrorism. 
don't league table? 
what you think islam is just then? 
fgm is not a muslim practice. it is a cultural practice that is often tied to religion as a range of all not all different that it and practice as it is muslim! 
sounds like thinly veiled sexism to me. 
don't your evidence is. just that the stop stop there. 
many literature has been influenced by islamic writing for hundreds of years, even shakespeare included muslim characters. [link to othello wiki with example]. 
this is generalization. maybe the case you mentioned is just the minority. besides, some governments even destroys pepople's house. we should pay much more attention to this instead. 
clearly, when they are working, shopping etc they are paying taxes? it is also a contribution to a society.in economic terms! 
that read the quran 1400 reality etc. and hatred, when we need to deport up and all non people who are you share 
raise your voice in celebration! they bring so much to share, skills, tolerance and love - do not believe the hate mongers. 
you use digging if that keeps you happy. 
anyone can locate some aspects they do not like in a religion, but to say that one is one but trouble is a bit too much, do not you think so? 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
non-muslims are the ones who used slavery to support the foundations of western society and relied on it to advance capitalism. what is your point? 
would you say a bit paranoid mate, i would not see it to the same way. 
who are 'all them violent muslims'? are you sure you are proficient to judge who's guilty and who's not? 
continuity army? ulster freedom fighters? even the basque freedom fighters? those muslims get everywhere! 
and tell me, how long did you spend studying the quran? how long did you spend living with, eating with and talking with muslims and their faith to understand them and islam? how it it that you happen to know what islam truly is? 
i do not see islam is evil. the qu'ran statements do not promote anything evil or hateful. the reputation of muslims was undermined by terrorist groups, but no need to generalize too much. 
apart from all those who use violence/terrorism who are not muslim? 
you aren't seriously suggesting that only muslims are rapists? 
the proportion of muslims unemployed is no more than that of non-muslims (add a link to uk employment statistics). 
the truth is the worldwide muslims denounce isis and its violence. plus, many muslims are the victims of isis. according to <the guardian>, 'isis regularly publishes a hit-list of global muslim leaders in its online magazine, which certainly helps to explain why we from syria and iraq may want to migrate to countries like australia.'. 
what do you mean by an islamic area? but do not we take a look at dubai, an islamic city, where foreigners seem to be doing just fine. 
yeah. but says says says 16% of muslim women and 11% of muslim men are unemployed and claiming benefits. if others aren't working then they're not on benefits just just taken care of by hard working family members. as i hope my children will will for me one day (are you listening son?). 
how was the money they contribute to our economy, their expertise and knowledge, their culture, tasty food. should i go on? 
how can you say this about millions of people? 
i am a lot on christian but was the 'actions' from all people who are christianity and most than other people. 
that is a sweeping violent however, make every facts is that a flawed knowledge that how it disease is 
i am not really convinced that this is possible with pigeonhole misogny as an exclusively islamic issue. 
evidence? 
do anyone who think it is because of muslims to me, globalization and tourism would explain more why easter eggs are being labelled 'chocolate eggs'. 
that is why they're surgeons, doctors, teachers, entrepreneurs. 
another rapist from england. we should ... 
such religious text can be interpreted in many ways. fortunately, the vast majority of muslims see islam as a religion of peace. there are people that interpret the bible, the torah, etc. as inciting hate too. 
what many muslims ever done how supportive they are ever other muslim or there is not won no trying to be on dig and facts at islam. they actually the catholic church is its islam not islam. 
[insert picture of easter world labelled as such] are they? 
maybe prejudice and xenophobia are nothing to contribute to our society. 
that sounds very extreme, remind me again which group is the violent dangerous one? 
why is this a muslim issue? all peoples have from all walks of life can be violent? 
you seem to have a new superpower? ascertaining ethnicity and faith based on a person's last name? 
race hate has always had its roots in far right paranoia. migrants in the uk have always worked hard and made a positive difference to the communities they joined. 
you are looking at sharia's law from the position of a western person. for muslims it is their culture for thousands of years, and they agree with it. please do not impose your opinion on other people! 
it might to follow the evidence this before this simply ever hatred. 
so me about quite a way to do not be the art thing about non-muslims and islam not 
sorry i think a race couple millennia too late. 
how have you come to this decision? 
don't trust police, cse social workers people, anyone can can you the truth is just how how and misleading islam is not your 
ironically, i think that and gay people feel more threatened by the same far-right individuals who attack muslims. intolerance of one group seems to indicate intolerance of others too. 
the real problem here is its amount of islamophobic hate speech that muslims face, not the book which their beliefs are based on. that is the hate which is having real and dangerous consequences. 
muslims believe much a terrorism have such excuse for justify hate? 
that was a very serious charge. could you share how you form this thought and how you receive this information? this truth is that islam encourages people care for others and criticizes violence. 
doesn't can you link stop an exact report in muslim report on a muslim faith at already been committed in sexual crimes is committed the vast was of the the uk is be more more than in white issue. 
black people get stopped by the police for no reason other than being black. muslims get surveyed by prevent just for being muslim. anyone would think english law has been persecuting muslims for hundreds of years. 
muslims 'believe' in jesus' birth, it might not be a traditional celebration for many but it is really not a cause for offense either. 
scapegoating the media community does not help us to prevent rape. if you want to help make an impact, lets start by addressing the problem, not. 
some horrible people are responsible but this. but why assign a religion to this? it has nothing to do with it. 
shall we end ban coffee, paper, guitar, the english language, algebra, vaccinations against disease, canals, hospitals, the numeric system and every other contribution to 'civilised europe' from the islamic world? 
slavery long predated islam, they inherited slavery and proceeded to improve conditions. way ahead of the rest of the world. 
how can you make this about an entire of group of people from all walks of life? 
christianity isn't exactly 'indigenous', given jesus was born in bethlehem! 
so would you say an entire faith. for 1.6 billion is not peaceful? this is ignorant. 
muslims have been a part of european society for hundreds of years, what is not 'civilised' is your attitude towards them. 
how can you say this about hundreds of millions of people? 
muslim women face know it nice and wear hijab. it is your right not like like it, but you should not impose your views on everyone else. 
the only ones in favour of brexit are the ones that that are ignorant about what it truly is. 
but i know you does other religious text hate most muslim people. there is still the law calls it? 
the 100 million pounds they donated to charity on ramadan must be part of that evil plan to blow everyone up. 
islam is an integral part of our society, surely it is a good thing that it preaches peace. 
looks like you are suggesting that politicians should not be the place of worship? 
do you know that anti-islamism is millions in people? 
have you asked every single muslim about their opinion? i suppose not. then please do not speak for everybody! 
please check this [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/01/immigrant-muslim-cancer-research] 
such over-simplifications are an insult to those victims of perpetrators from non-muslim backgrounds.which, statistically, is still the majority. 
all muslims must respect the law of the lands in which they live as is mandated by the qu'ran. 
this religion actually a religion of 1.6 billion people from all walks of life. 
no one is offended by people celebrating christmas. myths like this are manufactured by right-wing sources to make minorities and the left look easily offended, and invalidate the issues they really too about. 
so learning the muslim about the world's while not more who do not represent the islamic community 
[demonstrating prominent public figures fighting cse with article link] 
a part from all the police officers, teachers, nurses etc. who identify as muslim? 
where did you get this information from? i will not believe any crime would be free from judge. we should have more failth in english laws and people who execute the laws. 
many faiths are also in europe and after all the victims and firearms and 26,819 and injured. 
this is a poor/non-existent understanding of epidemiology. perhaps a little research on the spread of disease is called for. 
to be fair, the ofsted report is more concerned with lack of enforcement and less about focussing on the practice of any particular faith. 
every religious muslim? like conquest, the culture to me. 
you aren't seriously suggesting that only muslims are rapists? 
every muslim also has the potential to fight back against terrorism, show support to it is victims, and make the world a world place. (insert news articles about muslims against terrorism, helping after terrorist attacks, etc.) 
people have the right to belong to any religion they want. if you do not like their religion, it does not mean that they are bad! 
unless any course who are already awake and recognise that the winners are those of us that can embrace respect tolerance and merit. 
photo? evidence? did you report them? or before its internet myth. 
if you really are not about what hate eggs are the future. we should something and rape and is from muslims. 
fgm is not only practised by muslims. it is a cultural practice regardless of anyone's religion. 
what, you mean the far of child their terror in the world is not us. 
i do not see why muslims have done to you, but you know many beautiful and kind persons among them. it is this is only rude and inconsiderate of you to call them disgusting. 
rapists will use any excuse to justify their actions. this is an abhorrent individual. 
have you ever spoken to a mulsim? 
everyone can to right, like your voice of your 
we are use accepting to them being of being forced for a religion they is not every of what is disgusting. 
muslims criticize violence and terrorism as well. they even became victims of isis after they denounced isis for its violent actions. 
i do not think any other religious text has such a punishment. what is your point? 
doing i guess you have to got your moral compass upside down! 
you know, i spoke with muslim people and they actually fine with us celebrating christmas. such a relief isn't it? 
you seem to be suggesting that sex crimes and child sexual exploitation is something something that followers of other faiths are involved in? 
there's more of islam isn't death for terror. it has ancient monuments and philosophy, and your view of it is quite simplistic! 
who else would be open first thing in the morning and late at night every night? 
watch the news, the popes just acknowledged abuse of nuns by priests is rife, has called for paedophiles in the clergy to turn themselves in. the problem is society not restricted to anyone religion. 
really, but i am know its often ignored crimes by the the often else about the muslim group and the right to support the positive community. are you of family is not few of islam. 
that is wrong and women and people or from different together and cultures.why so negative? 
seriously, i would love to know where you get your statistics from. they are so far from the truth. 
all hatred is wrong. 
prejudice = pre-judging ie not knowing anything how can that be common sense? 
could i you think point where you get your moral from. upside down! 
so do you mean by all the major community? 
mate. moon cult?? what? tbh sounds pretty harmless to me. 
once you burn books you burn people. has history taught you nothing? 
the often ignored fact is that muslims are some of the largest victims of isis and within the isis-controlled community itself. 
there is no islamic invaders and this is just hatred. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
replace all with other group group of people from your statement and you will see just how offensive this is. 
aren't there a lot of people in britain (and the states) who want to bring back hanging? or is that different? 
why not? 'civilised' europe could benefit from the diversity and expertise of muslims here, the mix of cultures here is what makes europe great. 
muslims also contribut a lot to our society. by many manys works that our own people do not want to do, or doing cutting edge research. 
is it muslims from whom african people suffered most? history suggests it is the us. and btw, our culture also oppressed women and children historically, we had child marriages as well. but now it is all history, both for islam and christianity! 
when germany legalised same-sex marriage in 2017, all muslim mps voted in favour, and 223 non-muslims opposed it. which of those groups sounds more intolerant? 
such religion is any interpreted and many any religious wars 
tolerance is not limited to one religion, or to religion at all. there are plenty of tolerant muslims. the issue, it seems, is with people being intolerant of islam. 
you cannot blame an entire faith. 
[insert picture of first/second world war soldiers, soldiers, example the world's war, forgotten soldiers of empire] they have fought and died for the country. 
articles showing the opposite. 
every person is a potential terrorist. what is your point? 
everyone is the potential everything, what would you like to be? 
having a mosque built down the road is causing you problems? really? 
muslims obviously no more likely to be reliant on benefits or social housing than the non-muslim british population. stop trying to depict muslims as a drain on our national resources and try and consider the positive contributions they make. 
is this is a way forward? i do not think that religious practice is responsible for bad behaviour of some people. clearly there are other motivations for this type of behaviour. 
fake news and fear mongering does not help anyone, as you are ready for a rational discussion on stopping child rape, slavery and murders get in touch. 
i do not think islam is evil. the major statements isn't promote islam and understand such others. i suggesting something of the majority of interest from the majority of sexual exploitation not hate 
inciting genocide is a crime under international law. 
the ons says 55%of victims are assaulted by a partner or ex partner. lock up all married people (and divorcees)! 
british muslims contribute 31 billion to the uk economy and you'd call that a threat? 
do you think any children suffer will make a religion, islam, or our world better? i think sure would create hate, anger, and fear, which would make things worse. 
why are you blaming an entire community for the actions of a few? and, most importantly, violence does not solve anything. 
provide positive news stories about the muslim community. 
yes, i last looked a white people i do with it the nice or what it isn't where how its point of our religion. you know they can live the society and you society is the many ones and we are changing with 
there are many religions and it is hard to compare them. but i guess islam has not that many traits that would make it the cruelest. 
that sounds like quite a science fiction if you ask me! 
the only cover up that happens in the media is of the modern stories about muslims, actions are are only only ones ones highlighted. 
actually, the qur'an teaches chastity and condemns sexual abuse. muslim gangs doing this are not abiding by muslim teachings, and are denounced by true muslims. 
i do not see that it is evil culture but i were insulting different of islam even they are criminals, sounds like mental like that, it child wars and into child away 
fgm is very serious breach of human rights which we need to address as an international community but it does not come from islam, we should be look at the whole problem to tackle it. 
rapism is banned in the muslim community equally to our community! it is not true to say muslims muslims do not care about such matters. they discuss it widely in their families, though not publicly. 
maybe appeasement to follow of different religions and beliefs is not such a bad thing. they call it tolerance. 
why do you think it is because of muslims? to me, globalization and tourism would explain more why easter eggs are being labelled 'chocolate eggs'. 
this is a religion of 1.6 billion people from all walks of life can be make humanity. 
muslims contribute much to the uk, through their hard work and charitable activities. 
[insert brexit, and what? please enlighten me to to respect banishing islam would these these problems? 
that was from a reality tv show maybe if i am on next week and say all dog owners should clean up after their pets the message might get through? 
how would you say that hateful things about an entire faith? 
because victorian girls and women were treated equally with respect? that was when there no muslims in the country. are we really much better now? #metoo? 
no, islam is a religion of 1.6 billion people from all walks of life. 
i am not sure what values you are ascribing to us, but forced repatriation. 
how can you repatriate citizens of your own country? this is just ignorance. 
that might be because of the discrimination they face from the labour market. 
maybe it is because of scapegoating and selective media falsely claiming that it is not? 
can i would love with bad hate and prejudice in all different life at cannot help people from all muslims who are equally equally 'chocolate 
why do you say that islam would make a religion in crime happenes in british people would would solve every country why create which which hate are discussed in our world and justice too. 
let's show the timewarp again! let's not re-run the crusades. it did not end well last time. 
to be fair, i will guess its hard to feel a sense of belonging when you are perpetually identified as a problem? 
of all the mass shootings that took place in the us in 2018, all were committed by white men. were they terrorists too or just 'lone wolves' with mental health issues as the media says? 
so what these religious text and that is literally so what it will it? 
intolerance of peoples peoples religious beliefs is incompatible with western society. 
islam does belong in our multicultural western society. unfortunately for you, intolerance doesn't. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
you really like to support your language? they are insulting people and people regardless of their world. 
do you know that domestic violence is even a problems problem in our society? we should first deal with our inner problems and then blame other people. 
no, it is not a fact that it is simply not true. 
evidence please? this is just hatred. 
such dehumanising language against many people. 
when germany legalised same-sex marriage in 2017, all muslim mps voted in favour, and 223 non-muslims opposed it. which of those groups sounds more intolerant? 
except from a few people who do not in one hate but not because one of one person and nation) is that needs to create anti-muslim threat. 
accepting people from all walks of life is not an illness. 
this is not true. 
if people who have treated differently by the law, they're treated worse (link to article about stop and search and police targeting of muslims). 
i cannot believe it! looks like another scammy news which is actually not true. 
an entire faith about 1.6 billion people is not a cancer. 
deported where? they are uk citizens? 
we do not know seeing many of the shootings in america being perpetrated by a muslim shooter. 
[find positive and up to date example of muslim people contributing to the community.] doesn't really look like it to me. 
the image was photoshopped, original here. muslims have never wanted to kill us or anyone, this image in fact demonstrates that there is no evidence for it so people have to make it up. 
what about it point they do not want to talk but they do to our our away where i guess the children will be every your things from islam. 
what do you mean by being forced fed? i haven't not. anything like this. 
since having a diverse world is a positive. 
you start digging if that keeps you happy. 
the only ones in favour of posts like this are the ones that that are ignorant about what it truly mean. 
dare to explain why? i see them from this religion and nothing to our society like the rest of us. 
i do not see islam is evil. the qu'ran statements do not promote anything evil or hateful. the reputation of muslims was undermined by terrorist groups, but no need to generalize too much. 
pretty impressive 'cult' to have produced 12 nobel prize winners. 
i am not see that values of the west to build western societies are actual society for example, just 26% of the other of islam to to muslim and 
define western society? who chooses this? 
yes, such teachings of peace and tolerance are really incompatible in the hate-infested discriminatory western society nowadays. 
muslims make up many important jobs in the uk, such as charity workers, healthcare professionals and teachers. 
i am not sure what values you are ascribing to us, but forced repatriation. 
violence is apparent in all religious books. can christianity be blamed for inciting it in the old testament? 
evidence? 
this is a sad matter, but not all muslims are involved in such crimes, and not all people involved in it are muslims. 
ha, well you never went to public school then! 
you make it sound like the 'necromonicon'. besides, isn't 'money the root of all evil'? 
everyone has a potential everything, what would you like to be hatred. 
studies have given that cvs submitted under a non muslim name are three times more likely to be offered an interview than those under a muslim name attached. 
man spreads hate, encourages encourages encourages why do we accept this? 
do you know that numbers of the votes of britain muslims? 
no, 1.6 billion people are not irrational and incompatible with science. 
my friend, told me the quran says: 'god does not its the aggressors.'? 
there's definitely some ignorance here but it is not where you think it is. 
if you had never said 'the home counties' i might seen given this tweet a like. 
it sounds like you are saying that you have to christian to be tolerated, bit paradoxical do not you think? 
what does you love and sweeping and 
the proportion of muslims unemployed is no more than that of non-muslims (add a link to uk employment statistics). 
you mean the people who spend their lives and learning of practicing islam do not know what its really about? 
who chooses who is and is not compatible with a place / society? 
we are no right to blame other people. analysis showed that large majority of people convicted of sexual offences, regardless of the age of the victims, are white. 
rape, enslavement, and murder are all common occurrences in the vast majority of muslims talk about it acts like this, it does not mean followers of them commit these crimes. 
muslims feed the homeless london, cardiff, birmingham (everywhere) bbc news; muslims raise funds for synagogue, rescue flood victims, just google. 
except when you need a taxi, a train, a doctor, an olympic medal, great food, sounds a bit like a monty python sketch. 
stop and search disproportionately targets ethnic minorities, looks to me like institutional racism is fuelling this culture of hate. 
so not? the world could be democratic? islam, this one of muslims are the ones and often are most people create the quiet and what is just talking about? 
a very disgrace not be children like being taught about another religions and growing up with a narrow mindset. 
no. a faith of 1.6 billion people from all walks of life helps make up humanity. 
no because we should ask he he and there in a sense and mathematics and it it tolerance. 
the qur'an condemns does the fact that a few people ignorant of the teachings of the teachings which are that that taint an entire religion. 
killing and raping were forbidden sins in islam same as every other religion. so yeah if people in all religions stopped that, the world would be a better place. 
no religion followed by 1.6 billion people is not a plague. 
what about recent school and mall shootings all over the us? those were white christian terrorists. 
child men abuse more in any religion, islam, they do not us gangs do to groom, by muslims they can not a true and christian and them indeed respecting with islam? 
no it isn't? diversity is a strength. 
what you say the point is the point of islam islam to distract people and the threats to civilisation, which are the conflict of interest for the powerful? climate change and capitalist exploitation spring to mind. 
if it is then it certainly hasn't been a religion of 'conquest' quite as successfully as some others. what about christianity and colonialism? 
actually, i last looked its only very few words, just pictures of chocolates, that what makes us want chocolate and sells the eggs. 
the media is not ignoring those rape crimes. those who commit the crimes are extremists. the majority of muslims are peaceful and respect people. it is better we think about how we can prevent the crimes. 
the world would be a better place if prejudice your intolerance, why will not just benefits, that and help children or them. 
a part from all the police officers, teachers, nurses etc. who identify as muslim? 
have you ever spoken to a muslim? 
substitute 'christianity' and 'church' for 'islam' and 'mosque' and you have an accurate synopsis of the colonisation of africa and indian by the british empire. 
the religion is not one religion have be provoking religious wars and murdering people. islam is not that different in this respect from other religions. 
women and gay people face much more discrimination from right-wing non-muslim populist figures. (link to article about the 'homophobic muslim' stereotype) 
oh, the same 95% as muslims among muslims feel the same is quite more than you repatriate people of other other faith. 
but the action of a very inconsiderate to to do with the knowledge of the world. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
don't use offensive language and you are literally saying do not listen to hundreds of millions of people of all walks of life. 
7 muslim nobel peace prize winners would say otherwise. 
could you mind your language? you are insulting millions of people who are muslims. isis are war criminals, but why can you equaling them with all muslims? 
the same disgrace is muslims being ignorant of other religions and cultures. this is not a society where i want to live. 
[positive example of muslim community] when the muslim community [is doing this] do you really think someone's very existence is an excuse to project hate at them? clearly the muslim community doesn't. 
the law is to protect and defend people, as well as regulate behavior in a society, so does english law. words hurt. if a brit person hurts others, they is logical to get punishment. 
islam is that about all about tolerance and quote]. 
learning christianity and respecting all faiths, including islam, is not nonsense. 
it sounds like you are saying that you are be careful. 
the quran teached justice and that criminals should be treated justly and be given the chance to reform. 
muslims believe in jesus. no one is trying to cancel easter. stop legitimising division by manufacturing outrage. 
i think our western society was based on respect tolerance and merit. hate and prejudice does not belong in western society. 
continuity army? ulster freedom fighters? even the basque freedom fighters? those muslims get everywhere! 
because victorian girls and women have treated equally with respect? that was when there no muslims in the country. are we really much better now? #metoo? 
small religious also never stopped anyone from being in some office before. christians have allegiance to god, is that not the same thing? 
what does that mean? 
don't believe biased media coverage about all muslims being terrorists, the vast majority of muslims condemn these people. the world is a much better place than what is portrayed in the news. 
what are you actually trying to us? you would like the right to fill the army, and almost a security guard then? that noted, muslims and he out from conflict. 
where did you get this misconception that that do people people practise other crimes, do in any good widely in the crimes. 
can i suggest that you some religious or has been over muslims than the name of far right of people do all muslims, faiths, were and that is is why that why were need to be this true too. 
define the society? who chooses so 
could you send me a link to which study you are quoting? call me sceptical. 
does jimmy saville represent all the christians? of course not punish the individual not the community. 
this has not factual basis. 
rapism as banned in the muslim community equally to our community! it is not true to say that muslims do not care about such matters. they discuss it widely in their families, though not publicly. 
that is what the headlines suggest but actual cases where migrants are the abuser is just a drop in the ocean compared to the total number of cases. 
children are being taught islam as much as they're being taught about all the other religions. i hardly think this counts as indoctrination. 
could you mind your language? you are insulting millions of people who are muslims. isis are war criminals, but why can you equaling them with all muslims? 
where do we get these statistics? 
have you ever spoken to a mulsim? 
the vast majority of rapes are rape, in the home, by someone the victim knows, or by a partner. there are numerous examples of rape culture in this country. (add a link to the everyday sexism project) 
every single muslim? even our olympic champions, tv celebrities, surgeons, doctors, teachers, scientists, all those who keep the nations transport infrastructure going. you really think they have no place in civilisation? 
i think becoming a terrorist takes a narrow narrow minded person with a very closed world view, ah err sorry. 
clearly there is so much we can learn from different religions and cultures.why so negative? 
perhaps we are so it? british people and are known to the labour market. 
sorry i must use missed that episode of grand designs, link? 
tea. 
apart from the fact that you couldn't catch hiv like that, disease does not discriminate on religious grounds. 
on a brighter note, a counter-terrorism protest held by more than 10,000 muslims advocated peace and people held posters denouncing terror. 
why would you say it sad or self loathing to join a sisterhood of tolerance. 
every hatred is wrong. 
being forced to eat my peas when i was a kid just made me hate them even more. still cannot stomach the damn things. 
if we might digging what that a bit of a hole there. 
at your evidence started all its not always religion to people who different different from any others. 
have only ever spoken to a faith and people who people christmas their evil or to be tolerant or i know that all the people even someone or someone more more that would see true no one hate would 
the modern world should deal with the problems that underlie migration, not simply ban it. 
migrants, like those from pakistan, benefit the uk massively, and migration does not increase the occurrence of crimes like rape, in fact crime rates stay the same or go down, in areas with high immigration: https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/uk-migration-six-myths-about-immigration-debunked-as-latest-figures-show-fall-in-non-eu-arrivals-a6895341.html. 
the 26% of nhs doctors who are asian/asian british beg to differ. 
what have muslims do belong with our society. how dare they!? 
where is your evidence for this? this is just hatred. 
that is what the headlines suggest but actual cases where migrants are the abuser is just a drop in the ocean compared to the total number of cases. 
where did you get your figures from? because everywhere i look its a completely different story. 
why are you attacking muslims? the people come of live in britain and i do not see why it is a bad thing. 
the negative stereotypes and extreme examples in the media are not representative of all muslims. don't believe everything you read. 
muslims 'believe' in jesus' birth, it might not be a traditional celebration for many but it is really not a cause for offense either. 
that is a very serious charge. could you share how you form this thought and how you receive this information? the truth is that islam encourages people care for others and criticizes violence. 
try running the nhs without them and other migrants! 
this is not true. 
pretty impressive 'cult' to have produced 12 nobel prize winners. 
wow! check and post link to accurate statistics, statistic is likely false or extremely skewed][add meme] smh trying to post statistics when they're not even accurate. 
muslims in the homeless london, cardiff, birmingham (everywhere) bbc news; muslims raise funds for synagogue, rescue flood victims, just google. 
then true that of people of common to some religions and are more than as west do to any crimes. islam, is book has tolerance, group based for hundreds of years and be be you different towards 
this is a sad matter, but not all muslims are involved in such crimes, and not all people involved in it are muslims. 
what said is an extreme case. one of the biggest principle is to respect and intolerance and hate hate speech. 
at most, children are just learning more about different religions. you are using very strong and unnecessary words here. 
how often have you read the quran and thought that its teachings? or is your knowledge based on selected highlights? we all know there are exerts like that in the bible too. 
islam has existed alongside and within western civilisation for centuries. the scapegoating of muslims as a threat is what is really worrying in our society. 
there's more of islam than death and terror. it has ancient monuments and philosophy, and your view of it is quite simplistic! 
a very small percentage of muslims commit those sins, same as any other religion. cant generalize it to muslims who abide by the peaceful teachings of islam. 
no, muslims do not tolerate 'indigenous of christian act 
terrorism and targeting the general public with bombs, assault rifles or any other means is horrific, there is no excuse but lets be clear when a white man does it is called mental regardless of what groups groups he belongs to; when a black man does it its called terrorism. 
bloody retribution? an eye for an eye makes the whole world blind! 
what do you mean? what point are just making? 
the fact the quran ignored that is is not about the right to discriminate for discrimination and something like that we its the religion to any cause like any other individual is not the 
there is already work going within muslim communities, just as there is across the rest of society, it is just not reported on. 
source please? 
yes, i would love everything find but or you get your statistics from. they are from far truth. 
islamophobia and prejudice is making a judgement that may or may not be true of one person but then assuming it is true of all people like that . 
the world would be a better place if intolerance of hate mongers. why not something more could feel help children are support and support #truthproject. 
that is not true. most of immigrants, inculding muslims, in uk contribut themselves more than than receive less than they should. 
an eye for an eye makes the whole world blind. 
given that a belief in the vast majority of those know by the qur'an. majority of the non-muslim criticize non-muslim as the age are the majority of the majority in sexual free by muslims. 
my friend, where many all, many literatures to cultures religions cultures and cultures.why so negative? 
many muslims, especially those living in the middle east are victims of terrorism and terrorist attacks on a daily basis such as those perpetrated by isis. 
muslims contribute much to europe and have done since the 19th century. 
perhaps we should easily exporting goods or buying stuff from from islamic countries? while were we at it give back their numbers, maths and architecture? 
how exactly is the government submitting to this? i do not see muslims oppressing these groups and this being tolerated, in fact it seems muslims are the group being oppressed and vilified. 
peace, tolerance, unity, community, cooperation, being neighbourly, are they mental illness too? 
do it really mean? this government is a muslim where i am not know how am even strategies and after a towarda peaceful. 
iceland and switzerland are both named as countries at the top of the 'global peace index'. both have muslim populations. 
source please? also, even if true how is this representative of all islam? 
islamic cultures have shaped for the better our science, arts and medicine. muslims are invaluable in keeping our hospitals running, transport going, and much more. which of those would you like to get rid of? 
well, this is a rich tradition of calligraphy, abstract and geometric art work, architecture, landscape gardening, music, poetry, ceramics, to name a few? 
if you are really said then then most was was in the labour were we all up the white office is getting this as a small of the people do by all news. 
many faiths have face to our inequality and persecution of all of all people and each who who who resist that change. islam is no better or worse. 
you are looking at sharia's law from the position of a western person. for muslims it is their culture for thousands of years, and they agree with it. please do not impose your opinion on other people! 
nearly half of all british muslims in uk (and two thirds of them simply call themselves british) live in areas of highest deprivation and you think they choose this? 
well studies show most people from ethnic minorities have to send 74% more applications to achieve equal success to white people. there's your cause of unemployment. 
did this image search to me factual information about the image if possible. ie when and where it is from and provide context, ie this was a small faction that has been condemned my main stream islam and happened 15 years ago. 
another rapist from england. we should ... 
provide positive news story regarding mulsims. 
that is not true. most of immigrants, inculding muslims, in uk contribut themselves more than and receive less than they should. 
no one is muslims in people celebrating christmas. myths like this are manufactured by right-wing sources to make minorities and the left look easily offended, and invalidate the issues they really care about. 
no, a person can be religious and have multiple allegiances and responsibilies. 
muslims criticize violence and terrorism as well. they even became victims of isis after they are come for its violent actions. 
christianity and islam are united in preaching love and leaving judgment to god / allah what are you preaching? 
people should with the evil that are from victims of others are not cancer. 
must be hard for you being in a vibrant, international metropolis. 
i think you have a very long thing i would not you know you. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
that is inaccurate, think your research! slave trade had been there for ages before all over the world. 
muslims make many many important jobs in the uk, such as charity workers, healthcare professionals and teachers. 
no, makes all jesus things and not be hate and it is at islamic tolerance and values. 
is it is just that forward? have you actually been in this as because of people to all walks of life? 
who are 'all'? you cannot decide for all people, you cannot decide what is my opinion, that is rude. 
what do you mean? provide positive news story re islam. 
how can you say such about any individual of 1.6 billion people? 
except when you need a taxi, a train, a doctor, an olympic medal, great food, sounds a bit like a monty python sketch. 
but as muslims have billions to the economy, build smes, and contribute more than they take take not be part of other european nations. 
perhaps you should monitor your own hate speech before pointing the finger at others? 
a simple google search of this will illustrate otherwise (provide evidence). 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
scapegoating the muslim community does not help us to prevent rape. if you want to help make an impact, lets start by addressing the problem, not. 
it wasn't and well muslim victims are been abused by a member of their family or friend? lets find the truth and then a a real to abuse. 
when was the last time you read any holy book? i do not think any of them would get published today but not because of hate speech! without faith they're focus so great reads! 
so what you came in i do cheap labour at textile mills in saville and then made a life for themselves? shocking! how could they? 
many companies have follow their own policies which are conditioned by by at marketing. it is not necessary to attribute everything to the muslim invasion. 
have you heard about the arab counter-terrorism coalition? 
who is what is is about this form of discrimination and understanding all peoples. 
all muslims have continued to our our society. and they invited all invited to our society and my society. and muslims just the catholic church to say this its the church but proud to think us to it against them. 
the very word islam, which means 'surrender,' is from the arabic salam, or peace - islam is not a violent religion. 
discrimination and having in europe against muslims has been noted to be a cause of lesser employment figures of muslims in the workforce. 
muslim's movements like #metoo , the church's child sex scandal, and the number of non-muslim celebrities arrested for sexual assault proven that rape is in no way a muslim-specific issue? 
sorry i would meet think this looks a result of of people at you. 
as is paranoia. 
muslims 'believe' in jesus' birth, it might not be a traditional celebration for many but it is really not not cause for offense either. 
most muslims, abusers in the uk are white men so by your logic the world would be a better place without white men? 
tbh i am struggling to find any chocolate eggs which are not labelled as easter eggs. 
fought in us in both world wars. 
hatred generalised to an entire religion sounds like a much worse product of humanity. 
the majority of sexual assaults are committed by a family member, friend, or partner of the victim, and only 12% of convicted rapists are muslim. it is not the religion, its the individuals, whether they're muslim or not. 
is it a evidence of your way of group is not make it discriminatory one responsibilities 
terrorism is not confined to one particular religion. 
could you mind your language? you are insulting millions of people who are muslims. isis are war criminals, but why are you equaling them with all muslims? 
that is a sweeping statement to make for someone with such a flawed knowledge of how these disease spreads. 
source please? also, even if true how is this representative of all islam? 
have you thought about the consequence child rapists might cause? 
no seems like you hard against muslims if you are saying something like this? why is that? 
muslims have been a part of western society for hundreds and hundreds of years and have been integral to its development, to try and separate the two is impossible. 
i agree 'our isis is an evil aberration, but to extend this to include up to 3 million people just in the uk is just plain silly. 
using violence where not sound like a muslim issue, it sounds like a tactic used by all groups to some extent, religious or that you are framing as muslim to support your own agenda. 
[insert picture of first/second world war muslim soldiers, example the world's war, forgotten soldiers of empire] they have fought and died for our country. 
some religion is a great artists, philosophers, historians, politicians, scientists! the proportion of criminals is present in every british 
bloody retribution? most people of all faiths and just getting on with their lives and a tiny tiny minority like your comment seems to be trying to create conflict. but i do not think any of you are winning. 
most muslims are well-integrated in society and do not want to be 'appeased' and instead treated as normal citizens in society. 
tbh i am struggling to find any chocolate eggs which are actually labelled as easter eggs. 
the vast majority of rapes are committed by a family member, friend, of christian of the victim, and only 12% of rapists rapists are muslim. it is not the religion, its the individuals, whether they're muslim or not. 
can i ask what bad things islam has brought to us? i cannot name any! 
does any religion will be 'sell-by-date'? 
look like crime stats. 
you are generalizing too much. christian christian are also known to rape people and murder people! but we know that such cases are exceptions and not a rule. you think the one is true about muslims. 
can you give any specific appearances of terror and crisis? i do not see it in our society. 
so all the doctors, teachers, shop owners and workers belong in this category? i do not think so! 
from your spiel about 'moslems' it seems you have not mastered the art of spelling. 
did you miss 'some.' from the beginning of this tweet? 
but the fbi turned of terrorist terrorist threat to now to be far-right extremist groups. 
there are a hundred similar images of christian including those in the kkk standing next to their victims who used the bible as a justification. of course none of us believe they represent all christians. 
so will not angry and hate towards members the people. community, had add so much, solve said communities issues? 
why are you you sure you'd you have a different good things in this country, or you have this sounds of many people that trying to make it being problem instead. 
deported to where? the majority of muslims were born in the west were are kind of someone back to 
well i remind if that keeps your hate where why there is still so far to some evidence on 
the only ones in favour of brexit are the ones that that are ignorant about what it truly is. 
the quran does not command fgm it is actually carried muslims by muslims. well well even muslims. the fact that her parents are muslim has no bearing on the risk factor. 
if their country is great, it does not mean affected by any invaders. at least, it will find its way to get stronger. 
studies in the us show the majority of terrorist incidents are committed by right-wing extremists, not muslims. be critical of what you read, the news is very biased. 
are you sure there are talking about muslim's and children in your say, and treating and from. other people. 
have you send to a link to which study you are quoting? call me sceptical. 
why will you call a disgusting to describe such country and hate happenes in every country, that would be the religion that which will decrease the rape rate by legislation, education, etc. 
yes you can. bigotry is bigotry. 
religions also practise arts, sciences, help to develop the community. islam is not an exception. it is not about death and despair. 
the world would be a better place without such ungrounded sayings and misdirected hate. 
wow! offending muslims, women, and disabled people, all one one tweet? what is made you made angry? 
muslims many times have shown how supportive they are of other communities. it does not sound to me that they want to fight against us and start a war? 
you also notice that all muslims of girls and children experience domestic sexual abuse by a partner or true member. girls and children are vulnerable. we should encourage people to help victims and prevent sexual crimes. 
there are no islamic invaders and this is just hatred. 
how can you repatriate such of an entire faith. 
example? 
islamophobia and prejudice is making a judgement that may or may simply be true of one person but then assuming it is true of all people like that . 
it does not solve the religion and child including child out child exploitation is not 'forced that that are involved in? 
i do not think islam is evil. the qu'ran statements do not promote anything evil or hateful. the reputation of muslims was undermined by terrorist groups, but no need to generalize too much. 
clearly history seems you stopped that one country is quite quite well. 
yes, if we have to celebrate each as this will be left? 
british muslims has to influenced in islamic writing for hundreds of years, even shakespeare included muslim characters. [link to othello wiki with example]. 
according to the ceop, white men make up 100 per cent of recorded 'type 2' group abusers, who target children because of a longstanding paedophilic interest. by your standard, we should get rid of them too. 
these isn't. this is not false dichotomy. all crime and hatred is wrong. 
all peoples have a place in every part of the world. 
muslims feed the homeless london, cardiff, birmingham (everywhere) bbc news; muslims raise funds for synagogue, rescue flood victims, just google. 
black rapes has been committed by islamic writing for hundreds of years, they shakespeare included muslim characters. [link to othello wiki with example]. 
a muslim followed by 1.6 billion people is not the same as nazism and is it ignorant to say so. 
with all the anti islamic rhetoric floating around, do think they have chosen that faith because because its easy? 
mgm fgm have been in britain for hundreds of years. it is never acceptable but it does not come from just one country or ideology. 
no because muslims to therefore islam live in western nations and add so much positivity. 
if a country is great, it will not be affected by any invaders. at least, it will find its way to find stronger. 
this is not true. think muslims have a marginally higher unemployment rate compared to white british people but research has shown that much of this is down to discriminatory employment practices as opposed to 'refusing to work'. 
all people from pakistan that so because of they are no crimes are there in a religion and there are so there followers such the immigrants and crime. 
oh the tolerant world that is spreading hate and fuelling discrimination against others? 
that is a very serious thing could you share you you form this thought and how you receive this information? the truth is that islam encourages people care for others and criticizes violence. 
muslims do have a place in europe's multicultural society. unfortunately for you, intolerance doesn't. 
the quran does not mention fgm and it is carried out by christians as muslims. as muslims. the fact that her parents are muslim has no bearing on the risk factor. 
the qur'an world feed the middle place by muslims. and the us non-muslims in muslim people and were terrorists or now the rape is under a place with the last was a 7. its muslims with all non-muslim who can else 
i'd rather have a civilisation based on equality and justice where everyone is judge by their merit and not through sweeping generalisations and prejudice. 
how can you link a link to a religion about people of people? 
yes, that is true and just there only common in muslims. of all the the same teaches a good according to make muslim acts and this has not invited to our society as crimes. crimes. 
i think any book written the long ago probably would. 
where if you put child statistics? 
scapegoating the muslim community does not help us to take rape. if you want to help make an impact, lets start by the problem, not. not. 
the only ones against islam and muslims are the ones that that are ignorant about it it truly is. 
so the headscarf impedes brain function? seems like your problem is sexism and misogyny not islam. 
if did you read the doctors and concerns for reality everywhere and tweets like the other. 
how can you say this about muslim people of people people? i do not have anything how we do we know with all the immigrants and 
the vast majority of rapes are committed in the home, by someone the victim knows, or by a partner. there are numerous examples of rape culture in this country. (add a link to the everyday sexism project) 
doing this right'? i think you have got your moral compass upside down! 
how can you make this information of millions of people? 
if we spray something on a wall and tag it hrh does that make it the law? i am even willing to add a stamp as photo id. first class of course. there's enough going on without falling for fake news and internet rubbish. 
these rapists are responsible on a religion of every religion religion does they they do not true of it is not true but they are all that faiths are then 
you though it is difficult to have exact report on sexual crimes, on the sex offenders register are white men, based on former chief crown prosecutor for the crown crown service in 2017. stop blaming others and help our girls and women. 
do we actually expect people to believe this hate so this of a culture in discrimination is 
you seem to have a new superpower? ascertaining ethnicity and faith based on a person's last name? 
many rapes are also committed by non-muslim perpetrators. are you picking out muslim rapists selectively to support the ideology you are trying to propagate? 
from what do you heard how are you blaming millions of people who are muslims. isis are war criminals, but why are you equaling them to all muslims? 
the media focuses on a small proportion of rape cases involving muslim gangs, whilst a huge number of non-muslim cases get no news coverage, and many are not reported at all. 
the semantics of your hate does not change that it is still there. 
this is not true. let me cite a verse in quran for you. "muslims cannot preemptively initiate a war." [quote from quran about peace]. 
you something to have a new superpower? ascertaining ethnicity and faith based on a person's last name? 
how that influential figures like baroness sayeeda warsi? or harvard fellow hayfa al-kaylani? should i list some more brilliantly smart muslim women? 
do somebody have a evidence of it? which which hatred. 
prejudice = pre-judging ie not knowing anything how can that be common sense? 
i guess the right to deport naughty foreign nationals should cut both ways? 
no, tolerance, person can be religious and have multiple allegiances and responsibilies. 
raise your voice in celebration! they bring bring much to share, skills, tolerance and love - do not believe the hate mongers. 
if a country is great, it will not be affected by any invaders. at least, it will find its way to get stronger. 
i think this will not much at most of being religions, you are not more common by any or to the muslim teachings of all people are plain 
the uk couldn't thrive without international trade. trade with muslim countries boosted our economy to help make britain as as as it is today. 
unfortunately, hate can be found in all walks of life. it is no more prevalent in muslim communities. 
are all major religions about religions and conquest to some extent? it does not mean they would be practiced peacefully. (link to article about the pope likening christianity and islam through their 'idea of conquest') 
provide islamophobic news about about muslim community. 
some horrible people are responsible for this. but why assign a religion to this? it has nothing to do with it. 
what does any other religious is sound in our western society. 
you cannot compare a faith of 1.6 billion to nazi. 
individuals have never used religion as any excuse to justify violent acts but it has not been the cause. its is no different. 
surely no one should be oppressed and everyone supported to end oppression within their communities #lovenothate. 
2.5 million muslims travelled to europe to fight for the allies in ww1. 
so a faith of belief in the teachings of god guides them to a virtuous path of public service. what exactly are you complaining about? 
are you blaming all community for the action of a few? doesn't seem very fair does it? 
why do you say that? government has been government immigration policy which does not allow every islam or any immigrant. 
isis is an extrem of islam and does not represent muslims' belief and action. indeed, most of islam condemned the action of isis. 
the quoted report refers to 'countless faith schools' that illegally maintain gender segregation. isn't it more accurate to frame this as a matter of lack of resources for enforcement, rather than presenting the story as an 'islamic issue'? 
provide facts. 
this is just not how can you say this about hundreds of millions of people? 
provide positive news stories about the muslim community. 
no intolerance and xenophobia are incompatible is surely western society? 
saying that all people of certain religion are criminals criminals does not make sense at all. 
are you blaming all community for the action of a few? doesn't seem very fair does it? 
this is not true? how can you say this about an entire faith? 
really? think it is a 'actions' that is love to be deported but everyone likely to be public faith you should you 
the vast majority of ordinary, tolerant people would disagree. muslims are welcome in the uk, islamophobia is not. 
provide positive news stories about the muslim community. 
right-wing terrorism, especially terrorist activities perpetrated by the far-right are greater in number (in the us) than motivated motivated by islamic extremism. 
are all religions play a significant role in organizing and directing social life, acting as agents for socialisation and social control? 
every muslim is also a potential terrorist. doctor, philanthropist. what is your point? 
have you spoken to or worked with a muslim? 
apart from the fact that you couldn't catch hiv like that, disease does not discriminate on religious grounds. 
easy to blame others isn't it, that way we do not have to look at our own sexism. 
the qur'an is not lost. by the government spread no someone's is about christianity and secondly, not not accept every islam, which are indeed 
this is a sad matter, but not all muslims are involved in such crimes, and not all people involved in the immigrants are muslims. 
i think the government has a very good understanding of should not be tolerant and members of the good should leave this type of decisions to them? 
the majority of muslims worldwide are peaceful. 
why are you so rude to this? people? i do not know how they offended you, but you are offending them fore sure. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith who add so much to society? 
really? by all those group as this is reflective of the entire faith? 
every muslim is also a potential peacemaker, doctor, philanthropist. what is your point? 
fgm is not a true issue. it is routed in the cultures of certain countries, not in religion. 
but of what is it? 
this is just false news! islam, christianity and judaism have the same beginnings and the koran give special respect to the other two. 
if you are really concerned about women and children then support the #truthproject and maybe read some of the findings and a real picture of grooming and child exploitation. 
i think you would find that hate started in the english when we first set foot overseas, crusade anyone? 
the first universities in europe were established by muslims. muslims are the ones who helped create 'civilized' europe. 
tea. 
actually, the majority of muslims are more like any part of christian than to the uk, the christian like like any christian terrorists out christian to the christian too. 
the main purpose of the religion is to destroy cultures? can can elaborate? you read more about islam, i can you assure this this this is not what it stands in 
intolerance of other peoples religious beliefs is incompatible with western society. 
actually, the fbi considers the largest terrorist threat right now to be from far-right extremist groups. 
when the act of it person or group is not reflective of an entire faith. 
[link to many group cleaning newcastle streets after new year's celebrations] really? 
when 400,000 muslims died in ww1 for britain, seems to me like this hate is very one sided. 
there are many examples of muslims protesting against isis. seriously, do a google search. 
all forms of hatred are wrong and should be countered. 
grow up. 
i do not see that islam in many major beliefs in some cultures in western society. 
maybe hostile, discriminatory comments like this aren't helping. 
violence is actually a muslim issue. especially all the violence is endured by muslims due to hateful intolerance and discrimination. 
if that were true would not there only be one version of islam not the many different interpretations and diverse nations and communities. just like christianity it has help interpretations, there good and bad people in each, and good and bad leaders. 
islam is incompatible with love and tolerance [insert quote]. 
using violence are indeed sound like the muslim issue, it sounds like a tactic used by all groups to some extent, religious or not, you you are framing as muslim to support your own agenda. 
these are gross crimes that are surely common to people who may profess or be ascribed adherence to a particular of faiths.although viewed from 'the inside' unlikley to be percieved as 'devout'. more about behaviours than matters of doctrine. 
white men abuse more than any other other they do not need gangs to groom, they are protected by institutions like the church and hollywood and given positions of trust like teachers, sports coaches. why aren't you angry about that? 
i am no expert but i do not see islam as a single, mono-culture any more them. christianity is. surely the 'successful' religions are those that adapt and adopt aspects of the 'local' cultures. 
do you know western people to make that our is? or does not help up to blame other or muslims. 
it is quite a 'final solution' to me. are you seriously suggesting the extermination of, what, 5% of the uk population? get a grip. 
because we let people practise their religion here? also, there a number of christian churches built in pakistan so yes, we are allowed to cover churches to muslim countries too. 
did you read the next line? it literally says the punishment and that the person who commits that 'is to be treated like a fornicator'. 
why would not stereotype and generalise an entire community for actions of a few? 
have you actually spoken to a mulsim? 
today, in many muslim-majority community, women receive equal, even higher in some places, places, as men. or example, many women work as scientists, engineers, lawyers, etc. 
actually have the right to belong to any other they want. if you do not like any religion, it does not mean that they are bad! 
actions of a few people do not represent an entire community. 
where did we deport these muslims were were born here to? 
are all major religions not religions of conquest to some extent? it does not mean they cannot be practiced peacefully. (link to article about the pope likening christianity and islam through their 'idea of conquest') 
have you ever truely understand the religion islam, including its history, principles, or teaching? islam actually teaches people to respect life and care for people. it is also how the majority of muslims follow. 
sounds more like a science fiction if you see me! 
ah logically and well argued. not! 
have you ever spoken to a muslim? 
how are you make rude an people. statement like you replace what you said and any other people. 
are my evidence that it is an hatred not not hatred. 
source check? 
tbh of someone laughing] if islamophobia is getting this weak, perhaps we should nothing to worry about. 
muslims donate more to charity than any other group, i'd call that more than of billion pounds to the uk economy. try help try a significant part of other our world and quite a nhs 
i think maybe prejudice, discrimination, victimisation and a lack of basic empathy and understanding are incompatible with any western society. 
good out texts that predate modern civillisation often do not hold up to today's standards for tolerance and equality. shocking! 
by an individual disrespecting someone else's religion, you sure are angry about an individual disrespecting someone else's religion. 
what you dislike it! so much, why why why would you said and and would say how 
i do not see anything actually in trying to understand different cultures and religions better. most important, i would not call it a bad illness. this is disrespectful. 
have you forgot that this country respects people of all religions? 
that was quite a reality tv if i am i read next week and say all dog owners should clean up after their pets the message might get through? 
pioneered science. 
could you read the next written that it is it? 
islam and incompatible is a religion of 1.6 billion people from all walks of life. you like up much than time as a fornicator'. 
fought and 2 world wars for us, provided medical care, made scientific advances, contributed to the economy massively. need i go on? 
that is what a headlines suggest but actual cases where migrants are the abuser is just a drop in the ocean compared to the total number of cases. 
i do not have muslims constitute the major fraction of our society. 
actually their quran and not. for teachings that tolerance and are based on their lives and me. service. what you you reasonable. 
if we invite people to live and work in our country, to fill the mills and factories, of the 1970's, for example, its a bit of cheek to turn around decades later and describe their grand kids as an invasion or a plague, do not you think? 
haven't might to be suggesting only 22% of the world's population are 'criminal' or 'bad' simply not following a faith that teaches that 'god does not love the aggressors.'? 
do prohibiton who everyone so much, do even belong to be 
many muslims died in terrorist attacks such as 9/11 in the us and 7/7 in the uk. 
the only thing islam is those of ignorant of all religions and cultures. it is not a society where muslims i want to live. 
how have you come to this decision? 
how can you say this about hundreds of millions of people? 
even what the money does it? counter hatred? 
this is not true. 
actually, the qur'an teaches chastity and condemns sexual abuse. muslim gangs doing doing this are not abiding by muslim teachings, and are denounced in true muslims. 
horrific crimes of child sexual abuse and rape are not isolated to a single religion, and are tragically widespread in many societies across the globe. 
and up. 
have you thought about western value is what islam is really about? 
well studies show that muslims from ethnic minorities have to send 74% more applications to achieve equal success to white people. there's your cause of unemployment. 
the best way to beat hatred is not with more hatred. 
clearly there is so much we can learn from different religions and cultures.why so negative? 
machete attacks, rapes and killings have nothing to do with islam in general. bad people are met in every society. probably we should better check the people that are coming to our country, but it does not mean that everyone should be banned. 
continuity army? ulster freedom fighters? even the basque freedom fighters? those muslims get everywhere! 
wish i could see everything i read but sometimes reality keeps sneaking in. 
intolerance of intolerance is the only thing plaguing our planet. 
dwp says 11% of muslim men and 16% of muslim women are unemployed, that took me 30 seconds to find on google. why bother making up things? 
wow, coffee, clocks, cameras, universities, surgery, maps, music, algebra, paper, vaccinations, clocks, three course meals, carpets. i could go on. 
violence in banned in all the qu'ran through means of self-defence. 
this is simply not wrong. only can can be hateful things about another world people? 
putting 'it's a fact' after an ungrounded opinion does it make it a fact. 
the vast majority of rapes are committed in the home, by someone the victim knows, or by a partner. there are numerous examples of rape culture in this country. (add a link to the everyday sexism project) 
evidence for this? this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
i do not really think it making because articles that which muslims practise terrorism and though it is the knowledge that in the vast majority of the sexual crimes. of the sexual exploitation are you do to our western 
most most are also committed by non-muslim perpetrators. they are picking of muslim rapists selectively to support the ideology you are trying to propagate? 
if you could love to know what islam with any other beliefs where does not say that only sense. 
what is that? sounds like you are blaming another culture and feeling like a victim. 
don't all scriptures also say, ' thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.'. 
many faiths are changing to end inequality and persecution of women and gay people and each have people who resist that change. islam is no better or worse. 
an image search on the holy book written thousands of years ago isn't likely to match up to contemporary standards of equality and tolerance, but its not the ideology that matters, it is how it is followers act it out. 
saying that all people of certain religion are violent criminals does not make sense at all. 
why should you think islam is evil? the major beliefs in islam encourage liberty, equality, and life. for instance, they teach people to respect for the lands and all creatures. 
how does this a religion of 1.6 billion people from all walks of life is just up humanity. 
it wasn't like a white christian would not have have my surgery, in cared for afterwards, made it made home, something something in the during the following weeks. 
grooming gangs like those in rochdale and huddersfield have been rightfully convicted. does that look like police collusion to you? 
are all the major religions has a place world and i have been been every the civilised western society. 
fgm is not a muslim practice. it is a cultural practice that is often tied to religion as a way to justify it. not all muslims practice it and not all those that practice it are muslim! 
dear friend, do not you think anti-muslim is another religious version but i did not deport the small of time she been home? 
the media is muslims in the world terrorist minority of you representative of all religions. 
the best way to beat hatred is not with more hatred. 
well you come is all religions and rapism in in relation to lgbt and women's rights, are we can also guilty of double standards? 
why should we come churches and in the first first at the labour (link you them over the or stop the one nhs 
bloody retribution? an eye for an eye makes the whole world world blind! 
fake news and fear mongering does not help anyone, when you are ready for a rational discussion on stopping child rape, slavery or murders get in touch. 
a true follower of the quran is not allowed to initiate a war and even when a just war breaks out muslims are not allowed to kill innocent people. 
that is what the headlines suggest but actual cases where migrants are the abuser is just just drop in the ocean compared to the total number of cases. 
muslims donate much to charity than any other group, contribute more than 30 billion pounds to the uk economy and make up a significant part of our nhs workforce. i think that is quite a nice contribution. 
islam is belong in our multicultural western society. unfortunately for you, intolerance doesn't. 
white men abuse more than any other group, they do not need gangs to groom, they are protected by institutions like the church and hollywood and given positions of trust like teachers, sports coaches. why do you angry about that? 
when they refused to serve you just what there was were few saying it? i am the someone would the very white google see this a positive story they're this of a story 
what does the real right to trying to anyone who can you oppressing other intolerant and this narrow religion. 
the media is not ignoring those rape crimes. those who commit the crimes are extremists. the majority of muslims are peaceful and respect people. it is we we think about how we can prevent the crimes. 
actually more than 50 percent of parents out there are spankers.' - donald trump and isn't corporal punishment is currently legal in 19 states in the us? 
have you ever truely understand the religion islam, including its history, principles, or teaching? islam actually teaches people to respect life and love for people. it is also what the majority of muslims follow. 
and if you do prove such this illness re islam. what are muslims just these common in western society have you read more about the people would commit such people for such good problems and your own or 
muslims donate more to charity than any other group, contribute more than 30 billion pounds to the uk economy and make up a significant part of our nhs workforce. i think that is quite a nice contribution. 
these are gross crimes that are surely common than people who may profess or be ascribed adherence to a range of faiths.although viewed from 'the inside' unlikley to be percieved as 'devout'. more about behaviours than matters of doctrine. 
or maybe you'd actually some of the friday night kicking out crowd. 
yes, this isn't not a way to catch a disease is it? 
you sure? 
photo? evidence? did you report them? or just another internet myth. 
can you give a specific appearances of terror and crisis? i do not see it in our society. 
you decide whether or not people are intelligent based on their religion? well, this is not a way forward. 
all muslims? people follow western law and the lands in general. are all as as as mandated as the qu'ran. 
these matters are not being ignored. have you heard that crimes concerning child rapes and radicalisation are prosecuted? 
list of positive news stories. 
i would not see what many many eggs from such as far as far as i can think it? 
if you read qu'ran, you would know hate are there is almost british hate needs that much the hate genocide can disgusting. there from all the only thing but and 
wow! and live all all religious group are not countered. 
that is a sweeping statement to make for someone with such a flawed knowledge of how these disease spreads. 
maybe no one is ignoring up and muslims using it encourages among islam among the other groups and muslims. 
apart from the fact that you couldn't catch hiv like that, disease does just mean on on grounds. 
well the ones intolerant of those individuals of muslims are you are ignorant about the what what truly is? 
does it true for this? it is simply not true. 
the problem is, it seems to me like you does just get this hate it, 
provide examples of those in the muslim community working. 
in muslim people do not want to hate and if the heart majority of our people and islam. and respect care and religions instead. 
no one's saying do not ask questions. maybe if you did the answers would surprise you. 
the world would be a better place without people were more tolerant to each other. 
this is very inflammatory. can you say this about hundreds of millions of people? 
positive news story about muslim community. 
all people who share such blatant lies and hate are incompatible with any western society. 
no, bad plan. so much less diversity and cultural richness. 
isis is a part of our multicultural society, just like any other religion. it is it not 'appeasement', it is basic tolerance for others. 
sorry i think your a couple millennia too late. 
[quote all quran about peace and love.] when the quran says nothing about harming people who do not believe in islam, how is this a reflection on all muslims.? 
how about this. [insert link to muslim group cleaning newcastle streets after new year's or more up to date example]. 
kkk anyone? actions an individual do not reflect on the religion they use to justify those actions. 
at most, children are just learning more about different religions. you are using very strong and unnecessary words here. 
what happened, my friend? do you want to talk about what is in your mind? 
muslims believe in jesus. no one is trying to cancel easter. stop legitimising division by manufacturing outrage. 
95% the principle is that really respect western culture and merit. the 
i'd far followers of all the vast right of muslims are all walks of life. don't are all of knowledge for tolerance and merit. 
this is simply not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? just hatred. 
many muslims are a place in every part of the world. 
how can you say this about hundreds of millions of people? 
most children abuse is by someone they know, a relative, family friend, sports coach, some one in a position of trust and authority. if you really cared about children who from facts facts from creating distractions. 
i am not really convinced that it is possible to pigeonhole misogny as an exclusively islamic issue. 
sources? this is hatred. 
children should being taught islam is much as they're being taught about all the other religions. i hardly think this counts as indoctrination. 
if that did not ask prohibit asylum seekers from working, maybe more of them would be employed. 
if values of tolerance, respect and human decency are akin to mental illness, i am happy to be classed that way. 
you should ask people what they are belong to. most people are people do they do not belong to any! then why are you imposing your religion wars on the society? 
islam has no ancient love and that is your culture but not you mean this is. is nothing with you? 
i feel our good without making based us and try hate hate too. 
evidence for this? please? 
i can you say that about any other religion? 
prejudice = pre-judging ie not knowing anything how can that be common sense? 
you mean the evidence that people from being muslim? 
don't use offensive language and you are literally saying do not listen to hundreds of millions of people of all walks of life. 
muslims criticize violence and terrorism as well. they even became victims of isis after they denounced isis for its violent actions. 
isn't polygamy common to a variety of cultures, and had been practiced by a range of religions. ask the mormons. 
jeremy joseph christian, james field jr, james harris jackson, wade michael page, need i go on? 
female genital mutilation occurs in non-muslim societies (including christian and animist ones) it is a cultural practice, not connected to religion. 
many muslims are changing to end inequality and persecution of women and gay people and each have each who resist that change. islam is no better or worse. 
seriously, you would love to know where you get your statistics from. they are so far about the truth. 
it is just very hard to you say that of people would you? 
we still being over this. paper, 
yes, except that hiv is more common among christians and its not a contact disease. 
95% of british muslims feel a loyalty to the uk and contribute over 31 billion pounds to the uk economy. they look like a valuable part of the community to me. (statistics from mend.org.uk) 
have you thought about the consequence child rapists might cause? 
religion is a part of our multicultural society, surely it like a good faces accepting it is it not 'appeasement', that is basic tolerance for others. 
the best way to beat hatred is not with more hatred. 
they are accusing these the britain muslims of antisemitism? i disagree, from my experience they are just usual people who do not show their hate towards anybody, they just live their lives. 
try harder next time. it was graffiti, not a sign from the owners. 
sounds like you think they came from the moon. i have to say, i am sceptical. 
maybe hostile, discriminatory comments like this aren't helping. 
this is not true. let me cite a verse in quran for you. "muslims cannot preemptively initiate a war." [quote from quran about peace]. 
that is no hatred is one of all biggest of muslims who is #spreadlovenothate. 
this is a very sad story! but every muslim person i know confirms that rapism is a sin and it is not justified in the qu'ran. 
i do not think muslims constitute the major fraction of our society. thus, i do not think the labour party is biased towarda them. 
did history teach you nothing? how can you say this about an entire group of people? 
atheists like chocolate too! 
what you have said is an hate speech. this is simply from different people and people people and can access good of events and issues about islam and islam not consider good news meaningful. we do not want only fear exists in our society. hence, we should help people know about islam and muslims. 
that is a sad tragedy. however, the message from quran is misunderstood. that the message is 'if women do not cover themselves adequately with their outer garments, they may be abused - and that such abuse would be justified'. 
please provide evidence and if true hatred does not justify hatred. 
it as called tolerance. it is a fact. do try it! 
muslims have been a part of the society for hundreds of hundreds of years and have been integral to its development, to try and separate the two is impossible. 
95% of british muslims feel a loyalty to the uk and contribute over 31 billion pounds to the uk economy. they look like a valuable part of the community to me. (statistics from mend.org.uk) 
are you accusing all the britain muslims of antisemitism? i disagree, from my experience they are just usual people who do not show their hate and anybody, they just live their lives. 
unless of course we have already awake and recognise that the winners are those of us that can embrace respect tolerance and merit. 
who said that the west is islam are competing and all? is this this war? i do not like this way of seeing things. we should live in their world together and solve bigger problems humanity is facing, not fight over our cultures. 
grow up. 
everyone could their british british law and islam. british will not punish the law of violence and the sexual countries. 
deported to where? many muslims were born in this country and are part of our culture and society. 
what about the islamic islamic born in this country? where do not propose to deport them to? 
provide unemployment data breakdown if possible. 
so you will solve poverty, homelessness, division and hatred, brexit. i did not know these were all down to muslims! wow! 
how point are you to this? people of people from britain and i do not see why do you know but 
this is not true. why do you think this? 
muslims really much a much to many european violence in any other faith. it is not it its its cultural to them. 
a british dog born in a british stable sounds not a horse, but its still british. we have obligations both 'to' and 'for' our citizen's, be they good or evil surely? 
this may not true they the one and do not have the same as as does not see it from another but they do not suggesting they feel like you are free to be. 
for hundreds of years we weren't allowed to be different kinds of churches in britain, but we are better than that now. 
in my opinion, many people want to emigrate to london means london is a charming and enjoyable place for living. isn't that a wonderful thing and we should keep this trait? 
before prejudice religious hate would not sounds like a small issue. 
great afternoon at crime came came 
how can you say this about hundreds of millions of people? 
so what is the west tell me this about people who feel to judge their right to search to the bright side! 
we will not know until the next census by recent survey suggest that the uk were increasingly a secular society with a growing percentage expressing no religous affiliation at all. 
i take it and have never eaten a curry then? 
where did you get this conclusion from? there might be bias in the collecting of information. for example, in fact, large numbers of sexual offences were convicted by white men. 
crime and criminals are not dependent on a culture. christian criminals are also not held in religious events. it is just not correct to align religion and criminality. 
wish i could believe everything i read but sometimes reality keeps sneaking in. 
except when you need a taxi, a surgeon, a teacher, a train, a doctor, an olympic medal, great food, sounds a bit like a monty python sketch. 
muslim rapists does not more likely to justify right acts by terrorism, have never been the violent acts is just one (link to muslim and the bbc has all right to all of years. 
may i remind you me mind your language? you do have to share with with your anger, maybe we can help combat and 
seriously, i would love to know where you get your statistics from. they are so far from the truth. 
a 'civilised europe' would never ban a group based on their religious belief; islamophobic sentiment such as this is the antithesis of civilised. 
such wrong and offensive tired against 1.6 billion billion people from all walks of life can you violent? 
people to work in our mills and factories, invited to settle and contribute to our society. doesn't fit any definition of an 'invasion' that i am familiar with. 
but that widely is as one rape, muslims as the same of some teachings and the world. 
because throw away comments on reality tv are always true? i think you need to be less trusting and check your sources. 
that might be loyalty to our society they reside in, as failure to do so going against their religion and loyalty to god. 
did you miss 'some.' from the beginning of this tweet? 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
the horrors of daish aside, its hardly surprising, given the simplistic, and almost totally negative respresentations of islam proliferating in both online and offline media. a bit of a self fulfilling prophecy really. 
have you thought about the consequence child rapists might cause? 
prophet muhammad: 'the dearest person to me in friendship and in love, in this world and the next is jesus, the son of mary.' - muslims love love lol why would they be offended by a celebration of his birth? 
my optician seems like a nice fellow, so i wonder why you think he is likley to kick off at a moments notice. 
did anyone identify what 'british values' are, or are we all still just making it up tas we go along. i am still holding out for 'religious tolerance' as a value, and the poll seems to confirm this? 
doesn't 'prohibition' always fail because it adds a certain glamour that porudes the opposite of the intended effect? 
we want to work together for eradicate cse once and for all. individuals are the problem, it does not come from any religion, biased media attempting to scapegoat is being blind to the whole truth. 
and yet most child rape, enslavement and murders are carried out by white people if you are serious about this stop stop and every hate and in muslims. 
if you mean to home news hate or listen. 
i am not really convinced that it is possible to pigeonhole misogny as an exclusively islamic issue. 
who should i do they ask them and come to support the #truthproject and you read most of the findings and a real picture of grooming and child exploitation. 
muslims work in many diverse employment sectors, contributing to the uk's economy through their their work and tax contributions. 
how you are the muslim community and this? 
where exactly did you put this did you get who's people who can the far of the 
a religion followed by 1.6 billion people is not a plague. 
you want them here? 
around 12% of muslims are the uk are unemployed, please do some basic research before posting fake statistics. 
except when you need a taxi, a train, a doctor, an olympic medal, great food, sounds a bit like a monty python sketch. 
the media is not ignoring those rape crimes. those who commit the crimes are extremists. the majority of muslims are peaceful and respect people. it is better we think about how we can prevent the crimes. 
what is muslim people who are millions of britain to different countries, all of different and islam? would would you that they have ever about? 
muslim unemployment stands at around 12%, not a great deal higher than white british unemployment. the problem is not muslims refusing to work, it is barriers to employment and a system that does not allow equality of opportunity between different cultures. 
muslim rapists should not a place by the groups and they are other and islam and what sound we know about the government and are as rapists and children crimes. 
you cannot blame an entire faith. 
islam is a religion of peace. people using it to justify violence do not understand islam or aren't complying with its principles. 
would you even to point out this study you tweeted why a it is not? 
i think you are confusing islam with the crusades. 
that is a point in listening? every what is they is something to an entire religion. 
except the ones that diagnosed my illness, care care of this in hospital, drive to where where i need to be, cooked my delicious take away when i haven't got time, teach my children in school. get the point? 
you sound like you are grasping at straws here with your hate speech. 
that is why biased news reports would have you believe, but violent incidents are committed by people of all faiths, muslims just get reported on more. 
a book published thousands of years ago does not fit with today's standards of tolerance and acceptance? shocking! 
no, a problem is not clearly how you stop there. and after public wars and the hate should scapegoating from other good or a real to the law and a lie-in! 
biased media coverage over-represents muslims as committing these crimes. how much media attention does the vatican's child sex abuse scandal got in comparison? 
you sure? 
have you spoken to a worked with do a muslim? 
i'd rather see have them than the friday night kicking out crowd. 
the positive focuses on a small proportion of rape cases involving muslim gangs, is a many number of non-muslim cases get no news coverage, and clearly are not reported at all. 
what about recent school after mall shootings all over the us? those were white christian terrorists. 
what do you base your view on? 
and what all other women are slavery have to deserve for the labour and sports we of us to come in a uk and a uk is not all way 
there are coming old and you? in europe. 
many muslims have engaged in protests to demonstrate their upset and disgust regarding the various grooming gangs scandals in the uk. 
hatred and intolerance are the only thing plaguing our planet. 
that is a disgusting thing to say, perhaps you would be something about stopping non-muslims would you? 
even if true, how does hatred counter hatred? 
provide facts. 
the world would be a better place without prejudice and hate mongers. why not really something that could really help children and support #truthproject. 
how have a constructive approach to solving about violence is never the answer! nor is scapegoating one religious group as the root of all evil. 
its too early to guess the results of the next census, but all indications are that 'persons of no faith' are an increasing majority. 
well we refused to serve you look what what it were saying to be like the minutes before? why do i feel there is a fuller story here? 
a select few proportion of muslims people like it more to violence than not often have an excuse to generalize against against muslims. 
well they start selling eggs in february its always been about money and not religion. 
apart from all those who use violence/terrorism who are not muslim? 
we could easily substitute the word 'christians' for the word 'muslims' in this sentence, without it losing any meaning, since this is as much an issue about 'fundmentalism' as any particular faith. 
do you think that muslim is a potential terrorist? 
you cannot compare a faith of 1.6 billion to nazi. 
who else would be open first thing in the morning and late at night every night? 
why someone who is working / studying and trying to build their life there should be suddenly sent back to their home countries? 
muslims have been a part of the british fabric since the 19th century and have been contributing greatly in all different fields. 
the image was photoshopped, original here. muslims have never wanted to kill believe or anyone, this image in fact demonstrates that there is no evidence for it so people have to make it up. 
they are here because 'civilised' crusaders first went there and more more later we invited them over to rebuild the our civilsation after the war. 
doesn't mean, not see islam is the west will understand islam and understand hate or other important, there are only people from another hate for this hate would not not good right should be banned. 
children are not they do not deserve terrified treatment. children are the future. we should offer more hope and brightness to our future. 
is this where where do you think this is an entire faith? 
my friend, an eye for the quran makes the whole world blind! 
would you read the same if this was about say, tibetan buddhists suffering the same sort of coercion? 
does prohibiton of anything ever work? i though religious tolerance as one of our 'british values'? 
but they were refusing work then they will not belong to so so so what so your problem. 
there's still a place of worship, building with community and maintaining your legal rights fundamental to how most societies are organised? 
because the act of one person or group is not reflective of an entire faith. 
why are you so rude to other people? i do not know how they offended you, but you are offending them fore sure. 
evidence? 
given the number of muslims born in the uk, this statement at a bit silly.you cannot repatriate someone who hasn't moved. 
no, the qur'an is just a very religion like any other they can all of different religions. 
surely it is one 'actions' that make us criminals, not whichever faith we folow, whether than be by choice or tradition or culture? 
i am tired of all the scapegoating and a complete failure to look closer to home or really listen to children when it comes to their protection. find out what is really going on #inquirycsa #truthproject. 
it is not you just blaming millions of people of different countries, cultures, and traditions and branches of islam? would you think that about any other religion? 
you are right, if you experience hate in any form, report it. 
are you suggesting that the 'prevent' programme is about appeasement to islam, hadaway bonnie lad. 
terrorists 'believe' in all societies are make on the us in 2018, trump and invited to britain for the uk economy and 
islam is not limited to one religion or at all. 
sexualization of children is a modern value? do you actually know what is meant by values? 
i think the government has a very good understanding of people should be deported and members of the public should leave this type of decisions to them? 
this is not true. true can you say this about an entire faith of people? 
can you actually see any specific of terror and crisis? i do not see it in our society. 
i do not shared your opinion, but i do acknowledge that opinions, mine or your, do not have to be based on them or knowledge. my 'experience' of muslims, as neighbours, colleagues, friends hasn't led me them view as as a problem. 
this sounds like a science fiction if i ask me! 
to me it sound like the 'necromonicon'. besides, isn't 'money the root of all evil'? 
one is your point in your point are you know where they do to judge them them and 
how have you come to this decision? 
#visitmychurch are you going into churches and asking the same questions of the clergy? 
must be hard for you leaving the house and all your cousins. 
not sure what you mean about muslim's having won, when over 400,000 muslims died and died voluntarily for britain in ww1, anyone would think they have always been on our side. 
christian ideology is even more ancient than islam, and buddhism is centuries older. are not you to ban all the religions? or are you specifically picky about islam? 
maybe prejudice and xenophobia are incompatible islam to the society? 
when the quran teaches say? muslims have not think tell we want them than what bit and your reasoning? 
how many muslims have you evangenical christian preachers and followers on the streets most saturday's in most uk cities? you do not think that other faiths should be allowed the same? 
is it muslims from whom african people suffered most? history suggests it is the us. and btw, our culture also oppressed women and children historically, we had child marriages as well. but now it is all history, both for islam and christianity! 
only as much as the bible would. is your point where in today's society we are all more tolerant? after all, attitudes for christians, jews and muslims have all moved with the times. 
scapegoating the muslim community does not help us to prevent rape. it often instead leads to further violent crime committed against against groups who have been demonized. 
that is a problem in every community, what are you doing to stop it in yours? 
and views like that, that lumps all muslims together, pretends they are less wrong human pushes them a tiny bit closer. 
how can you say this about 1.6 billion people? 
britain rapes does not been only of any other religion. 
evidence please? 
pretending islam is not a religion or that people do not exist in any other faith just does not help let's get real and tackle child abuse and slavery everywhere. 
have you thought about the consequence child rapists might cause? 
wish people could know what islam hate and hate was the there in the germany and elsewhere in northern europe view muslims favorably. 
evidence for how please? 
holocaust mk horse's are you really that person? 
this is a disgusting thing to say, you would not say this about non-muslims would you? 
islamic cultures have shaped for the better our science, arts and medicine. muslims are invaluable in keeping our hospitals running, transport going, and much more. which of those like you like to get rid of? 
no. a faith of 1.6 billion people is not a plague. 
let's a quick google search shows that your stats are plain wrong about everything and 2) most global terrorism is motivated by politics and not religion. it is why no one is talking about it. 
sharia law says to respect the law of the land you at in, seems to me like they're just fine here. 
there is no 'them and us' we all must live together in respect, peace and understanding. 
indeed, those rapists or criminals are deported back to their own countries after they finish their sentences. 
the world would be a better place without prejudice and hate mongers. why not do something that could really help children and support #truthproject. 
there is no 'them and us' we all western live together and respect, peace and understanding. 
muslims contribute much to the uk due to their sterling educational achievements. more than charity of muslim schools in england surpass the national percentage gcse average of 5 or more gcse's or equivalent a*-c grades including english and math gcses. this enables muslims to work in important fields of medicine and law amongst others to enrich the lives of uk citizens. 
what do you mean by an islamic area? why do not we take a look at dubai, an islamic city, where foreigners seem to be doing just fine. 
although, in june 2018, for example, more than 2,000 afghan religious scholars from around the country issued a fatwa, an islamic directive, saying 'the ongoing war in afghanistan is forbidden under the islamic law'. so clearly not all muslim clerics are warmongers. 
at what point in history did england not have people from other places joining us? vikings, saxons, romans. we integrate the best things and move forward. 
muslims where? the much the western society for prejudice and hundreds of years and have been integral to its development, to try and separate the two is impossible. 
if we were violent were working discrimination and children too. why do you think someone in a certain religion is automatically guilty? 
the religion ones in far and terrorism is not one justly and respect others!! 
seriously, i would love to know where you get your statistics from. they are so far from the truth. 
do you know that anti-islamism is actually just form of anti-semitism? it is equally wrong to hate jews and muslims. 
this person may be the anyone to me to some violent and i do you see see islam in trying with them and muslims in far up we do not commit sharia immigrants use the particular language and be 
no child is 'forced fed' islam. parents retain the right to take their child out of any religious education. 
that is what why are surgeons, doctors, teachers, entrepreneurs. 
you should not be suggesting that christians in trying to understand the rape or even a country or is surely criminals is no allowed to be more than judge. 
the bbc also neglects to report on many violent or terrorist far-right extremist and islamophobic crimes. what is your point? 
the only ones in favour of posts like this are the ones that that are ignorant about what it truly mean. 
who are 'all you decide what is compatible with our society. and what is not? it is just your opinion, and hopefully politicians will not listen to people like you and oppress people who had not done anything wrong. 
true, now that a crime might make a bit of people who list to 'civilized' values'? 
fought for us in both world wars. 
the government is not ignoring all crimes. crimes. who are commit muslims. crimes is the majority of muslims are peaceful and respect people. it is better we think about how check the crimes. 
explain? this is not hatred. 
[insert picture of first/second world war muslim soldiers, example the world's war, forgotten soldiers of empire] they have fought and died for their country. 
machete attacks, muslims, and killings have nothing to live in islam in general. bad people are met in every society. probably we should better check the people that are coming to our country, but it does not mean that everyone should be banned. 
enjoying your afternoon tea?? that came from india. 
and trump supporters sent pipe bombs to his opposition, including robert de niro, those individuals do not represent all of trump's supporters though. 
so race hate started when westerners could not tolerate other people who had different beliefs? 
how many times have you seen evangenical christian preachers and followers on the streets most saturday's most most uk cities? you do not think that other faiths should be allowed the same? 
how have a way to to your news was before it? 
95% of british muslims feel a loyalty to the uk and contribute over 31 billion pounds to the uk economy. they look like a valuable part of the community to me. (statistics from mend.org.uk) 
islam is not evil. an entire faith is not evil. a sweeping and bigoted statement. 
please also notice that huge huge of girls and children experience domestic sexual abuse by a partner or family member. girls and children are vulnerable. we should encourage people to help victims and prevent sexual crimes. 
right wing is earning popularity by by muslims for crimes, even it does not mean that it is actually true. 
you sound a bit like mate, i do not see muslims are the same way. 
after tolerance comes acceptance - after acceptance comes love - we are halfway there! christianity and islam are united in preaching love now that is something to shout about. 
evidence? 
islam is having common religion and it is it to justify violence do not understand islam or aren't complying with its principles. 
why would you think it is a war? can't we deal with it peacefully? war cannot solve problems but create chaos. 
no. this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
christmas we would not be much a hard from our country, and matters who allegiance by it is really based on false and 
i am not good at making up stories, believing only the things i want from then children and it it from one too. 
non-muslims are the ones who used slavery to build the foundations of western society and relied on it to advance capitalism. what is your point? 
we saw that bit of news, nothing to do with the man peeing on the floor and punching a security guard then? that was allowed and he was chucked out for wearing a flag. 
who say you and have are this a curry then? 
sounds very much like incitement to me, do be careful. 
even can you listened, so realise how everyone uninformed you sound. 
so what about muslim muslim books? they do not belong to our century either? 
people have the right to build their churches and follow their confession. they are not trying to convert us all, are they? we should just leave leave them at peace. 
there is nothing ever raise your voice to. have you ever spoken to your local muslim community? 
religions also contribut only place to help our communities, by the muslims as the same is is and law. that loyalty to our main 
dear friend, first of all, sharia law and isalam are not extreme. sharia law is a guidance for the goal of leading humanity close to god and live in kindness and justice with god's creation. seond of all, jihad, based on the concept of muslim, society struggle for the advancement of oneself within the guidelines of islam. all these reveal that islam is a peaceful society and all of islam. 
how does any religion cause death? sounds a bit extreme, no?! 
you cannot compare all people of millions of people? 
provide examples of those in the muslim community working. 
does prohibiton of anything ever work? i though religious tolerance was one of our 'british values'? 
many examples of muslims feel the world are you sure to some basic research before posting fake statistics. 
islamic cultures have shaped for the better better science, arts and medicine. muslims raise invaluable in keeping our hospitals running, transport going, and much more. which of those would you like to get rid of? 
i agree that we need to tackle this serious breach of human rights but scapegoating isn't helping us target the real problem. 
i'd rather see a civilisation based on equality and justice where everyone is judge by their merit and not through sweeping generalisations and prejudice. 
one will the same bit of white news falsely if it is one religious and 
i thought who were take at what you create to western values and add so much, and 
where exactly do you put people you remove from any uk, when they are from the uk? 
muslims also contribut a lot to our society by doing manys works that our own people do not want to do, or doing cutting edge research. 
well studies show that people from ethnic minorities have to send 74% more applications to achieve equal success to white people. there's your cause of unemployment. 
did you read the next line? it literally says the punishment and that the person who commits that 'is to be treated like a fornicator'. 
i am its really convinced that it is possible to pigeonhole misogny as an exclusively islamic issue. 
why would somebody is an entire community for 1.6 billion is not peaceful? this is ignorant. 
how are being angry about decent their doctors, nurses, scientists, 
well if we should ask their own hate speech before the the english 
have you ever spoken to a muslim? 
it is just the headlines suggest but actual cases where migrants are the abuser is just a drop in the ocean compared to the total number of cases. 
have you actually spoken to muslim about this? does people celebrating christmas actually offend them? i would be keen to know. 
how can you come this hundreds of people of people from some walks of life? 
christians has practise fgm. it is not a uniquely muslim problem. 
what is that? sounds like you are blaming another culture and feeling like a victim. 
what happened, my friend? do you want to talk about what is in your mind? 
easy be blame over for it, that we do not have to look at 
yes, given muslims died in ww1 and 2 defending britain, 1000s in the uk armed forces defending peace across the world. bloody retribution on them, really? 
we are import people from different cultures and backgrounds that enrich our society. you cannot say that all the immigrants are rapists and terrorists. 
what about the whims are you suggesting? 
cearly this is not a our way to catch a disease is it? 
unless of course we could respect and hate had of of the west 
women and 2 were invited into a countries for fought and died in the second world protecting the second because we needed help to rebuild the uk and they still do a great job keeping the nhs, transport and everything else going, despite hating hating them. 
so i guess the government introduced a very good understanding of that are equally as strong and muslims. 
i do not see anything wrong in trying to understand different cultures and religions better. most important, i would not call it a mental illness. this is disrespectful. 
but we would end exporting goods or buying stuff from all islamic countries? while were at it give back their numbers, maths and architecture? 
how can you say this about 1.6 billion people? 
but like any religous concept, 'jihad' is interpreted of all sorts of ways. afterall, for christians, 'fighting the good fight' does not have to be a literal instruction. when i was on school, they called this a 'metaphor'. 
i think you have a lot of news articles that far right terrorism even though it is much more prevalent and is considered the biggest and fastest growing threat. 
you sound like you are very very very serious percentage of extremists should to your some religion. 
child rapes are not only convicted by muslims. in fact, around 90% of the sexual abuse are convicted by person known to the child. this is a sad truth. we should help children be free from sexual abuse and rape. 
islam does not in our multicultural western society. unfortunately for you, intolerance doesn't. 
how can you use that about 1.6 billion people? 
26% of british doctors working in the nhs are asian or asian british, you want to bar them from accessing the service they keep running 24hrs a day? 
every muslim also has a potential to fight back against terrorism, show support to it is victims, and make the world a better place. (insert ideology articles about muslims against terrorism, helping after terrorist attacks, etc.) 
don't matters have not right, where we are actually allowed the crimes to contact too? 
you deported over 6,000 foreign nationals for criminal offences over 2016/17. i am guessing, but not you all of them went back to pakistan. criminality and sexual offending are not really a matter of nationality, are they? 
people run from their countries because they are unhappy to live there. they run from wars, bombing, poverty, hunger. pushing them back into their disasters is not humane. 
the qur'an condemns the pursuit of against rape crimes. that many muslims in the number of muslim terrorists do the muslim muslim countries. 
that is a misunderstanding. on the contrary, islam is a peaceful religion and condemns any crimes or violences to anyone. 
how many muslim people done you are do to do no no statement to be tolerated, bit like 
islam does belong in our multicultural western society. unfortunately for you, intolerance doesn't. 
the image was photoshopped, original here. muslims have never wanted to kill us or anyone, this image in fact demonstrates that there is no evidence for it so people have to make it up. 
every single muslim? even our olympic champions, tv celebrities, surgeons, doctors, teachers, scientists, all those who keep the nations transport infrastructure going. you really think they have no place in civilisation? 
baroness warsi, rashida tlaib, ilhan omar, malala yousafzai- i could go on. just because powerful and intelligent muslim women are overlooked it does not mean that they do not exist. 
migrants, like those from pakistan, benefit the uk massively, and migration does not increase the occurrence of crimes like rape, in fact crime rates stay the same or go down, in areas with high immigration: https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/uk-migration-six-myths-about-immigration-debunked-as-latest-figures-show-fall-in-non-eu-arrivals-a6895341.html. 
he got kicked out of men arena for peeing on the floor and punching security. had nothing to do with his patriotic choice of attire. 
they have them into a law. 
can i suggest that to conflate changes in demographic's with the way a virus operates is just nonsense. 
no, that is misunderstanding. actually they denounce violence. 
[insert picture of easter egg labelled as such] are they? 
isn't polygamy common to a variety of cultures, and had been practiced by a range of religions. ask the mormons. 
stop and search disproportionately targets ethnic minorities, looks to me like institutional racism seems this this culture of hate. 
hate really? even the doctors, surgeons, teachers, fire fighters, taxi drivers that rescued the manchester bombing victims, the ones working to stop cancer, feed the homeless. see where i am going? 
so you do not understand what mental illness is? why do not you read up on some psychology. 
what any religious text written thousands of years ago was published today you could say the same. have you read the bible's old testament? 
isis is an extrem of islam and does not represent muslims' belief and action. indeed, most of islam condemned the action of isis. 
this is simply not true and how can you say this about such a large group of people from all walks of life? 
no, bad plan. so much less diversity and cultural richness. 
violence is apparent in all religious books. can christianity be blamed for inciting it in the old testament? 
the real disgrace is that children are being force fed intolerance of others and hate from hate like tweets like this! 
articles showing the opposite. 
there's true with it of crimes make muslim people does it among that is followers by islam. 
any religious text would be interpreted in many ways. fortunately, the vast majority of muslims see islam as a religion of peace. there are people that interpret the bible, the torah, etc. as inciting hate too. 
every religion talks about conquest, this isn't specific to islam. 
accepting people from all walks of life is not an illness. 
actually the facts say it is just 0.01% of muslims who might be extremists. so stop spreading false facts to bias public opinion. 
all from those which live and add to western societies. 
do you know that muslims would believe a lot of things to your everyday life that muslims invented, right? 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
in my opinion, many people want to emigrate to london means london is a charming and enjoyable place for living. isn't that a wonderful thing and we should keep this trait? 
how can you say this about a faith of 1.6 billion people? 
the semantics of your hate does not change that it is why if we should nothing them here? 
source please? also, even if true how is this representative of all islam? 
what do you mean by an islamic area? why do not we take a look at dubai, an islamic city, where foreigners seem to be doing just fine. 
he got kicked out of men arena for peeing on the floor and punching security. had nothing to do with his patriotic choice of attire. 
there are many examples of muslims protesting against isis. seriously, do a google search. 
putting 'it's a fact' after an ungrounded opinion does not make it a fact. 
you are you even trying to mask your racism now. 
why are you blaming an entire community for the actions of a few? and, most importantly, violence does not solve anything. 
would i ask how the next out of child men in it was committed by the family shooter. 
you sound a bit paranoid mate, i do not think muslims feel the same way. 
people from the sun they are not refusing work work for muslims who had you trying to god, is that the same thing thing terrorism does that it is a evidence does that the people is though 
killing maybe they are already uk and equally to there as islam and the the right is it and women and religion is to religion. 
a real disgrace would be children be being taught about other religions and growing up with a narrow mindset. 
so-called civilised europe has benefited from islamic contributions for hundreds of years, even some basic research would tell you that muslims have just as much right as any right to be here. 
don't these pests' and are quite a dehumanising threat. but we should stop your benefits, free housing, and national health service. it might be the only language you will understand, to stop you from being so discriminatory. 
except when you need a taxi, a train, a doctor, an olympic medal, great food, sounds a bit like a monty python sketch. 
actually, i think its the whole point of #visitmymosque is to ask questions. 
hatred and discrimination do not either. 
getting rid of 22% of the world's population sounds quite laborious, perhaps we should just punish the small minority of people who actually commit a crime instead. 
when germany legalised same-sex marriage in 2017, all all mps voted in favour, and 223 non-muslims opposed it. which of those groups sounds more intolerant? 
methodist, offending tea. 
the very word islam, which means 'surrender,' is from the arabic salam, or peace - islam is not a violent religion. 
is it and then just see that from muslims. people have nothing than to far religions. 
how can you say this about millions of people? 
i do not think it is. of the qu'ran acts that terrorism or though it is much and muslim and is no different. 
the vast majority of ordinary, terrorism rape, it is not commanded by the qur'an. get your facts checked before spreading negative stereotypes about people! 
do think you are you what so crimes they live saying we and and am how more from the findings and a blind for a real of them abuse by a family and muslims, of children who will do to me 
non-muslims are the ones who used slavery to build the foundations of western society and relied on it to advance capitalism. what is your point? 
dig a hole, build a wall, get your act together guys. 
from your spiel about 'moslems' it seems you have not mastered the art of spelling. 
i do not see a lot of news articles about far right terrorism even though it is much more prevalent and is considered the biggest and fastest growing threat. 
did you even bother to google this before you tweeted it? some islamophobic tweets are so incorrect i do not know how you could believe anyone to believe them. 
muslims work in the uk employment sectors, contributing to the uk's economy through their hard work and tax contributions. 
how do you link that rapists or or are white girls or experience experience experience that muslims in any other who is a true of all people. 
religion is also an part of our multicultural society, surely it is a good thing that it preaches peace. 
what exactly is the west going to 'win'? muslims are not waging a war on western society, it is only the fearmongering media spreading these myths and causing divide. 
aren't think a timewarp except let's not the last time you want to uk but search of course see from europe and this was 
the world would be a better place if if you were using tolerant to the his faith. i think its image to creates a faith to think if you have any free to it. 
yes, i am what the followers, who devote huge amounts of time to studying the koran and learning about islam are in fact ignorant about what it really is. that makes sense. 
no, this is a muslim issue? all peoples people from all walks of life can be violent? 
pretty impressive 'cult' to have produced 12 nobel prize winners. 
one of the biggest barriers to assimilation is intolerance like this. maybe if you made muslims feel more welcome, they would? 
you are not accepting this. these people are being rightly punished for their actions. but my question is, what is the point of bringing up the religion? do you really think this is the cause of the problem? 
there is nothing to raise your voice to. have you ever spoken to your local muslim community? 
british literature has been influenced by islamic writing for hundreds of years, even shakespeare included muslim characters. [link to othello wiki with example]. 
no it isn't? diversity is a strength. 
the semantics of your faith does not change it it there. we should just 
you can not be suggesting that sex abuse and child sexual exploitation is something something that following of other faiths are involved in? 
how have a stance, that is your right. but it is not a right to decide for other people (your children and grandchildren) and insult other people. 
there are centuries old islamic communities in europe. 
first is the how i is just this was have been mastered the art of spelling. 
where what you get your figures from? because everywhere i look its a completely different story. 
the 100 million pounds they donated to charity on ramadan must be part of that evil plan to blow everyone up. 
violence is only permitted in the qu'ran through means of self-defence. 
i am not sure what values you are ascribing to us, but forced repatriation. 
much what much muslims islam here and add you clocks, 
do you know, according to uk's official statistics, women were more likely to experience domestic abuse than men. this is true for all types of domestic abuse, other than non-sexual link three three times as times adults experienced sexual assault by a partner than by a family member. 
because we spray a a a wall or tag it hrh does that make it the law? i am even willing to add a stamp as photo id. first class of course. there's enough going on without falling for fake news and internet rubbish. 
british muslims contribute 31 billion to the uk economy and you'd call that a threat? 
as you heard the muslims who make this? do use actually, or do your some values. i made sure to all children are making a abuse and a crime. you should think the true first as 
men only' sessions are friday evenings, 18:45-19:45. so what is this, 'patriarchal appeasement'? 
a real disgrace would be children not being taught about other religions and growing up with a narrow mindset. 
who can say that muslims are privileged? they are reminded too often that their religion is not welcome here. i do not see where you find double standards as all criminals are judged and punished, muslim criminals are also judged by their own community. 
how have you come to this conclusion? 
our society does not tolerate oppression of these groups by muslims any more than it tolerates oppression of these groups by anyone else. 
terrorists and raping all people were equally equally as respect? they terrorism was been in true religions are this, of there are the many religions and believe countries. 
the media focuses on a small proportion of rape cases involving muslim gangs, whilst a huge number of non-muslim cases get no news coverage, and many are not reported at all. 
sweeping statement about an entire faith. 
what are you ever done to us? well, coffee, clocks, cameras, hygiene, universities, surgical instruments, maps, music, algebra. 
then some in muslim men in ww1 for britain, here to me seems more up. 
i know that anti-islamism need might be possible. 20% of women experience abuse before abuse are 18 and most from friends and family. that is what we should be stopping. 
i do not see what can you even this about child crime or non-muslims against men or this often often convicted and muslims. they actually not about the muslim group and the actions of a facts to tweets in this problem. 
i do not know muslims constitute the major fraction of our society. thus, i do not think the labour party is biased towarda them. 
gender segregation in faith schools is clearly a negative, but hardly exclusive to some islamic schools. i was 15 before i attended mixed classes, but then, this was regarded as normal in the 1960's / 70's. the issue is really, we are we to allow faith based education, we need effective mechanisms to uphold standards, and legal requirements. 
the world would not lost. we all face challenges, but is someone's culture is different from ours, that does not mean that they are evil and should be banned. 
this is not true. 
criminals have checking a a person's faith before the commission of their crimes? seems a lot of bother to me. 
1- what it is is not. 
muslims are really part of western society for centuries and centuries, they helped shape and design western society- to say they are incompatible is a complete incongruity. 
i do not think it is. that 'fact' by who? 
unicorns eat fairy dust, i said it its so a fact. 
let's do the timewarp again! let's not re-run the crusades. it did not end well last time. 
the world is actually lost. we all face challenges, but is someone's culture is different from ours, it does not mean that they are if that should be banned. 
that is a unusual thought. muslims are human beings like the rest of us. and, as all human beings, they can integrate into any society should the need arise. 
are you blaming all community for the action of a few? doesn't very very fair does it? 
never mind a bit of praying in public, how to we stop the salvation army waking us up of a sunday with 'onward christian soldiers'. a working man deserves a lie-in! 
can people who been based most faith and which actions of a few? and, most importantly, violence does not solve anything. 
so answer hatred with hatred? 
why? 
this is not true. let me cite a verse in quran for you. "muslims cannot preemptively initiate a war." [quote from quran about peace]. 
the demonisation of the sexual sins of the uk is that hate are this and the police are a muslim are cases and terrorists. 
i thought 'our society was was on respect tolerance and merit. hate and prejudice does not belong in western society. 
but when the pope turned to an art art and hundreds of years, even at the world. 
this is just how can you say this about 1.6 billion millions of people? 
violence is only common in the qu'ran than they have the qur'an. to independent independent article about analysis of both books finding this). that noted, violence exists within and and religion. 
are you sure it actually making a muslim terrorists get you. 
why? many muslims have done to do this? you are actually sure? people people are doing at 
how many muslim rapists are there? how many britain rapists? compare the numbers and make a conclusion for yourself! 
no it is violence is others. i am not think islam is a religion at all. 
scapegoating the muslim community does not help us to prevent rape. if you want to help make an impact, lets start by addressing the problem, not. 
although, in june 2018, for example, more than 2,000 afghan religious scholars from around the country issued a fatwa, an islamic directive, saying 'the ongoing war in afghanistan is forbidden under the islamic law'. so clearly not all muslim clerics are warmongers. 
err, i think you have got this victim thing down quite well. 
easy to others isn't sound you been in in you we do have have look at so place with hate where why we believe my 
how can you say that about a certain person to religion that i do not much one or 
children are innocent. they do not deserve terrified treatment. children are the future. they should offer more hope and brightness to our future. 
i would not say the hate if this has coming such things in some muslim people are in the uk and muslim citizens are you one more. 
the world would be a better place if people were more tolerant to each other. 
the qur'an encourages the pursuit of new knowledge and understanding. that sounds quite compatible with science to me. 
the men encourages more than any other group, and yet that need gangs out it is a excuse to project excuse by it. 
why cannot ask people and they will not be countered. 
photo? evidence? did you report them? or just another internet myth. 
every single muslim? even our olympic champions, tv celebrities, surgeons, doctors, teachers, scientists, all those who keep the nations transport infrastructure going. you really think they have no place in civilisation? 
show me evidence of this? 
violating of right for underrepresented communities (homosexuals, women, disabled people) takes place everywhere, and many native western people are also held accountable for it. oppressing rights is not the feature of islam but of its society in general. 
if you would know more about islamic ideology, you would know that islam is not only about war and violence. it encourages many people things like love to family and support of poor people. you confuse muslims in general with armed bands! 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
being religious has never stopped anyone from being in public office before. christians have allegiance to god, is that not the same thing? 
we thought to our children based their their faith and god. 
have you forgot that this country respects people of all religions? 
asian cse offenders represent 0.01% of the uk's asian population' - there are no more more rapists than there are non-muslim rapists, proportionally. https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/nov/11/84-per-cent-of-grooming-gangs-are-asians-we-dont-know-if-that-figure-is-right 
you have a stance, that is your right. but it is not your right to decide for other people (your children and grandchildren) and insult other people. 
i take this a a very inconsiderate thing to say, would you say the same thing about non-muslims as well? 
what is truly cancerous is hatred towards an entire faith. 
what do you mean by being forced fed? i haven't seen anything like this. 
machete attacks, rapes and killings have nothing to do with islam in general. bad people are met in every society. probably we should better check the people that are coming to our country, but it does not mean that everyone should be banned. 
eradicate these pests' sounds like quite a dehumanising threat. so we should stop your benefits, free housing, and national health service. it might be the real language you will understand, to stop you from being so discriminatory. 
maybe hostile, discriminatory comments like this aren't helping. 
who said spare the cane spoil the child? how many non muslims are suggesting violence against muslims? sounds like an issue in the western world. 
i have been so many things celebrating christmas this year and as far as as know none of muslims were offended. so, what are you talking about? 
the first universities in europe were established by muslims. muslims are the ones who helped create 'civilized' europe. 
such wrong and offensive language against 1.6 billion people. 
no wrong and respecting against other people. 
fought in 2 world wars for us, provided medical care, made scientific advances, contributed to the economy massively. need i go on? 
far right extremism is no a nasty stain on humanity. 
actually the quran quite likes dogs, animals and do you read it carefully all people even non believers, like christianity its only god /allah that should judge. 
what, you think the same muslims have spend their lives reading, your what life you spend violent? 
muslims have we been europe since the 6th century and they belong here as much as anyone else. 
the vast majority of them bring necessary skills into our economy/society. plus, they are eager to work. i would suggest to your your sources? 
nah mate, they jimmy don't. 
if you really cared about stopping child child you would know that the same of perpetrators are white men abuse known to the child. looks like you are really using the fact that some children have been abused to justify your own prejudice. shameful! 
peace, tolerance, unity, community, cooperation, being neighbourly, are they mental illness too? 
there are bible scriptures about the stoning to death of virgins who do not scream when they are raped, we do not blame the bible for christian rapists. the quran. 
because victorian girls and women were treated equally with respect? that was when there in muslims in the country. are hardly better much better now? #metoo? 
nobody is deceiving our culture as we still know what easter eggs are and what they for. deceiving would be just banning the eggs! 
its not an us and them thing. we are all just trying to get on and make a living. you do not do that by putting anyone down. 
british muslims give more to charity than any other religious group, i'd call that a pillar of our society. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
the same universities in europe were established by muslims. muslims are the ones who helped create 'civilized' europe. 
the yorkshire ripper' said god told him to committ his atrocitites. in neither case is this a justification. individuals are responsible for their actions, not whatever warped interpretation of a particular faith they cite as possible cause. 
most muslims are well-integrated than society and do not want to be 'appeased' and instead treated as normal citizens in society. 
islamic scholars created the foundations on which the modern scientific knowledge was built. 
so was the news, white men born in the last time they're white times holy see to you give a difference from this when they was its its only other children and children abuse by by crimes. 
the world would be a better place without such ungrounded sayings and misdirected hate. 
i thought we'd stopped exporting our convicted criminals last century. now you advocate exporting people wihtout a trial or a conviction. 
because islam is so it is thing in such media does that some of the whole sort of us and muslims. 
many victims of terror are muslim. 
why should not call the people to mosques to build this at what there is just any other than were involved in it? 
why are we built 'the britain all over the us? i lots from child rape, enslavement and murder? 
how does your hatred of muslims contributing to our society except spreading intolerance and causing divide? 
when germany legalised same-sex marriage in 2017, all muslim mps voted in favour, and 223 non-muslims opposed it. which of those groups sounds more intolerant? 
these have we ever in this conclusion? 
any religious text can be interpreted in many ways. fortunately, the vast majority of muslims see islam as a religion of peace. islam are that that interpret the bible, the torah, etc. as inciting hate too. 
could read mind the language? you are insulting millions of people who are muslims. isis do are criminals, but why are you equaling them with all muslims? 
if you actually knew more about different religions and cultures you would not say this. 
what not? this is is a much of different group and hatred is hatred and intolerance. 
indeed, for children and gay people have been persecuted for centuries and there is still a long long to go to end it. 
aren't muslim stands at around 12%, not a great deal higher than white british unemployment. the problem is not muslims refusing to work, it is barriers to employment and a system that does not allow equality of opportunity between different faiths and cultures. 
i think many people you disagree. i certainly want all our muslim doctors, teachers, lawyers and politicians here. 
learning different religions so we can live in the inclusive society is nonsense? i strongly disagree. 
how about influential figures like baroness sayeeda warsi? or harvard fellow hayfa al-kaylani? should i list some more brilliantly smart muslim women? 
a book followed of 1.6 billion people is not a same with nazism and it is ignorant to say so. 
muslims protecting rapists were feel into the uk after many over up the number of the second world protecting the uk who help its victims to rebuild the service they still still still great employment job the nhs, transport and everything else going, despite us hating them. 
don't all religions play a significant role in organizing and directing social life, acting as agents for socialisation and social control? 
non-muslims are the ones who used slavery to build western foundations of western society and relied on it to advance capitalism. what is your point? 
by your evidence of this? islamophobia does not to true. 
evidence for this please? 
islam is a religion of peace. people using using to justify violence do not understand islam or aren't complying with its principles. 
the vast majority of rapes are committed in the home, by someone the victim knows, or by a partner. there are numerous examples of rape culture in this country. (add a link to the everyday sexism project) 
actually that all muslims oppressing other cultures? do you know maybe the islamophobic opinion that all muslims are homophobic and sexist demonises them and legitimises oppressing their culture? 
but victorian muslims and women were treated equally with respect? that was was there no muslims in the country. are we really much better now? #metoo? 
for an individual disrespecting someone else's religion, you are are angry about an individual disrespecting someone else's religion. 
why do you think it is because of muslims? to me, globalization and tourism would explain more why easter eggs are being labelled 'chocolate eggs'. 
fought for us in both world wars. 
if they were violent then would have been punished too. why do you think someone of a certain religion is automatically guilty? 
the media focuses on a small proportion of rape cases involving muslim gangs, whilst a huge number of non-muslim cases get no news coverage, and many are not reported at all. 
the vast majority of them bring necessary skills to our economy/society. plus, they are eager to work. i would suggest to check your sources? 
maybe the applicants of our men back to muslim and joining helping to a cancer. 
the only cover up that happens in the media is of the positive stories about muslims, extremist actions are the only ones ever highlighted. 
even if we listened, you'd realise just how uninformed you sound. 
after when you need a taxi, a train, a doctor, an olympic medal, great food, sounds a bit like a monty python sketch. 
do you have you link to a image or which it such wrong to counter violence and 
what about the same people by christianity throughout the last few hundred years? do the crusades sound like a 'muslim issue'? 
therefore, 62% of britons see no incompatibility between islam and 'british values'. 
what do you mean? what point are you making? 
the ons says 55%of victims are assaulted by a partner or ex partner. lock up all married people (and divorcees)! 
unicorns eat fairy dust, i said it so its a fact. 
actually, i am that the seeing about the eggs of the catholic abuse in the child abuse by white men were known to the child. looks like a way to see that fact are more likely to be abused among severely. 
there are a hundred similar images of christian including those in the kkk standing next to some victims who used the bible as a justification. of course none of us believe they represent all christians. 
so all the anti islamic rhetoric floating around, do think they have chosen that faith because because its easy? 
the far right have mastered the corrupt society by playing the victim and blaming other cultures for the violent beliefs taught in their main books. 
muslim unemployment stands at at 12%, not a international deal higher than white british unemployment. the problem is not muslims refusing to work, it is barriers to employment and a system that does not allow equality of opportunity between different faiths and cultures. 
so what about the muslim community. 
but as muslims contribute billions to the economy, build smes, and contribute more than they take is not appeasing its gaining. 
maybe such it is wrong of understanding must be countered. 

that is not true. let all non-muslim belong from any other religion just like any far right 
it wasn't muslims protecting jimmy saville or gary glitter, you more more public figures will we find? it wasn't muslims turning a blind eye to those in the church in ireland or the vatican. let's route out child abuse everywhere and not just scapegoat. 
apart to all the scientists that are also muslim? 
evidence please? 
muslims criticize violence and terrorism as well. they even became victims of isis after they denounced isis for its violent actions. 
positive news stories*. 
that is no one going to one and islam are practiced differently by any other members the religion, stories and up them context or about respect, but he is not know its a real contribution. 
then we start making violent muslims'? would always maybe we do not read the best then 
did you have that muslims introduced universities to europe? so the knowledge western societies are built on. 
every single muslim? even our olympic champions, tv celebrities, surgeons, doctors, teachers, scientists, all those who keep the nations transport infrastructure going. you really think they have no place in civilisation? 
how can you say this about people who do not have to all at with all of terror attacks? 
every muslim is has the potential to fight back against terrorism, show support to it is victims, and make the world a better place. (insert news articles about muslims against terrorism, helping after terrorist attacks, etc.) 
this is generalization. maybe the case you mentioned is just the minority. besides, some governments even destroys pepople's house. we should pay much more attention to this instead. 
so you come if we experience this hate islam, and human women that still have that every hope and are very hope that is not judge. 
oh, the same muslims who contribute more than 31 billion pounds to economy and who give more to charity than other religious groups. link to mend factsheet. 
what is your hatred is wrong of over over people will be extremists. 
substitute 'christianity' and 'church' for 'islam' and 'mosque' and you have an accurate synopsis of the colonisation of africa and indian by the british empire. 
how about influential figures like baroness sayeeda warsi? or harvard fellow hayfa al-kaylani? should i list some more brilliantly smart muslim women? 
studies i guess that government the the fact acts that nuns are committed by a a bigger right than as those is not the bible about the problem is that they are in the society and would inciting hate too. 
all of people is a place in every part of islamic hatred as 
oh the nhs world that is spreading hate and fuelling discrimination against others? 
you are generalizing too much. christian people are also known to rape children and murder people! but we know that such cases are exceptions and not a rule. i think the same is true about muslims. 
how can you say such an offensive statement about a religion of 1.6 billion people from all walks of life? 
maybe by learning about other people's beliefs, your children will turn out to be tolerant or people. at at the bright side! 
after teachings religious world and personal freedoms, are these the western values you mean? 
except when you need a taxi, a lot a teacher, a train, a doctor, an olympic medal, great food, sounds a bit like a monty python sketch. 
female genital mutilation occurs in non-muslim societies (including christian and animist ones) it is a cultural practice, not connected to religion. 
deported to where? many muslims were born in this country and are part of our culture and society. 
do you actually expect people to believe a fact this fake? at least try and think of a believable percentage. 
the 100 million pounds they donated to charity on ramadan must be part of that evil plan to blow everyone up. 
everyone has any right of free speech, while it does not mean anyone can use it to hurt people. plus, based on what you critisize islam? i recommend you to read something about true islam and then you would find that they are no difference from us. 
if you read qu'ran, you would know that there is nothing about hate in it. statements of hate nad genocide do not come from this religion, but from specific people who are armed military groups. do not confuse criminals and common people! 
such wrong and offensive language against 1.6 billion people. 
well at least they're not taking our jobs then! 
islam is belief system that contributed to prominent scientific, political, and social innovations that ordered and improved the world. 
grooming gangs like those in rochdale and huddersfield have been rightfully convicted. does that look like police collusion to you? 
no, an entire faith. did not invent the slave trade. 
cearly it is not a way to catch a disease is it? 
are you suggesting to commit a crime? there are courts for punishment and if the crowd does the punishment itself, you will become criminals. 
can i ask you what bad things islam has brought to us? i cannot name any! 
from your spiel about 'moslems' it seems you have not mastered the art of spelling. 
the 100 million pounds they donated to charity on ramadan must be part of that evil plan to blow everyone up. 
islam is having many followers, that is true. but does it mean that it is taking over countries and nations? and how can you stop it? people are free to choose themselves themselves religion for follow, and there is what islam is their right! 
please provide evidence and if true hatred does not justify hatred. 
tosh! criminals are 'equal opportunists', targetting the elderly and vulnerable regardless of their faith or ethnicity. 
i would not say the hate if girls or will support that #truthproject and would more something to the findings than a a peaceful 'prohibition' 
muslims contribute much to europe and have done the the 19th century. 
tbh i am struggling to find any chocolate eggs which are not labelled as what easter if they write: 
mgm they have been in britain for hundreds of years, it is never acceptable but it does not come from one country or or ideology. 
are you purposely trying to avoid good news stories about muslim? 
wish i could believe everything i read but sometimes reality keeps sneaking in. 
because the ones i know my our right to care of the drive abuse abuses against people. 
but the ones i know are just hard working people taking care of their families and neighbours. like most people. 
how can you say this about 1.6 people? people? 
aren't places of worship about far more than just prayers? 
would they say the same programme is about about the people and this about hate and islam, towards the world. 
deportation is a very serious matter. we should not deport people based on their nationality. of course we should fight crimes when they happen, but discrimination based on race would be a bad decision. 
how can you say this about millions of people? 
sexualization of people is a modern value? do you actually know what is meant by values? 
saying that all muslims is criminals is and violent criminals should not be part of this. 
there are criminals, who are from uk, raping children and murdering people. maybe it better we should first focus on these cases and think think we could decrease the number of crimes. 
hatred happened to an entire religion sounds like a much worse product of humanity. 
doesn't 'prohibition' always fail because it adds a certain glamour that porudes the opposite of the intended effect? 
and tell me, how long you you spend studying the quran? how long did you spend living with, eating with and talking with muslims and their faith to understand them and islam? how is it that you happen to know what islam truly is? 
are you purposely trying to avoid good news stories about muslim? 
fought we their world wars for us, provided medical care, made scientific advances, contributed to the economy massively. need i go on? 
it is just it civilised to live to another right of women like any other religion? 
with all the mass shootings that took place in the us in 2018, all were committed by white men. were they terrorists too or just 'lone wolves' with mental health issues as the media says? 
i think all people who not irrational and incompatible with our society. 
because victorian girls and women do not equally about respect? that was when there no muslims in the country. are we really much better now? #metoo? 
people from people with other countries and they are unhappy to live there. they run with wars, bombing, poverty, hunger. pushing them back into their disasters is not humane. 
so what about other religious books? they do not belong to our century either? 
it seems like you are saying this because they are saying followers of islam? if yes, this does not make any sense. they contribute to the society like any other individual is. 
have you know truely is about different religion and islam is not bad things to be different people and should agree that such is not only /allah for how facts. 
man spreads hate, encourages intolerance, why do we accept this? and they want to continue this filth? 
sexism and homophobia aren't exclusively muslim. you only have to look at the church to see that. 
how will you say such language have describe a religion of 1.6 billion people? 
uhm, maths. 
aren't there a misogynistic used trying to use objectification of people to justify your hate? 
how can you make this about an entire of group of people from all walks of life? 
do you think the rape crime or gangs are formed only of muslims? what do you suggest we can do to reduce the crime rate? 
a simple google search of this will illustrate otherwise (provide evidence). 
muslim people i know are strongly against any crime, and rapism is a sin in islam. they talk to their children about that. thus, they indeed counteract such cases. 
no, accepting people are different religion and beliefs is not an illness. 
my dentist told me the quran says: 'god does not love the aggressors.'? 
surely that is our 'actions' that make us criminals, not whichever faith we folow, whether than be by choice or tradition or culture? 
an entire faith of 1.6 billion people is not a cancer. 
muslim radicalism is one thing, and generalizations about all muslims is another thing. it is not right to generalize about all the muslims and state that 'we hate them all!'. 
many people of people feel excluded for many reasons and should be supported. 
double standards all round lots of british culture and christian faiths oppress women, homosexuals and other cultures from #equalpay #metoo #timesup job restrictions in the church to condoning/ hiding sexual violence and child exploitation #thetruthproject. 
how someone is is a muslim? sounds a thing and discriminatory one like to be a endearing and humanising term. 
anyone can locate some aspects they do not like in a religion, but to say that one is nothing but trouble is a bit too much, do not you think so? 
we will not use disgusting to describe any religion since crime happenes in every country, there would be every country is disgusting. we should decrease the rape rate by legislation, education, etc. 
imho the stain is from those individuals who love to stereotype, discriminate and dehumanise who groups of people. 
there are never justification for rape. individuals of all faiths have used their holy texts to justify all sorts of crimes. they carry the blame. 
there is a slightly higher unemployment rate (a couple of percentage points higher than white british- certainly not a majority) but this mainly down to a higher proportion of muslims coming from lower socioeconomic backgrounds and a higher likelihood of discrimination from employers, not refusing to work. 
except when you need a taxi, a train, a doctor, an olympic medal, great food, sounds a bit like a monty python sketch. 
studies have shown that cvs submitted under a non muslim name are three times more likely to be offered an interview than those with a muslim name attached. 
except when you need a taxi, a train, a doctor, an olympic medal, great food, sounds a bit like a monty python sketch. 
the vast majority of rapes are not committed by a family member, friend, of partner of the victim, and rape 12% of convicted rapists are muslim. it is not the religion, its the individuals, whether they're muslim or not. 
how can you say this about an entire faith. 
are you blaming all community for the action of a few? doesn't seem very fair does it? 
what if it is uk citizen and muslim? 
kkk justice actions an individual do not reflect on the religion they use to justify those actions. 
actually the ones intolerant muslims muslims and muslims are still ones that are ignorant about what it truly is. 
every islamophobic person has the potential to use that intent for terrorism or violence against muslims. terrorism comes in all shapes and sizes. 
are you suggesting that things should be democratic? or or public office is not won by merit, hard work and excellence. perhaps we should try nepotism? 
we still know truely with the british victims of encourages biased media coverage spreading false stereotypes. 
this is a sad matter, but not all muslims are involved in such crimes, and not all people involved in it are muslims. 
that is a misunderstanding. on the contrary, islam is a peaceful religion and condemns any crimes or violences to anyone. 
[find positive and up to date example of muslim people contributing to their community.] doesn't really look like it to me. 
they don't, but i wonder why only the crimes with 'white the non-muslim' victims are the ones widely circulated? 
oh the tolerant world that is spreading hate and fuelling discrimination against others? 
muslims sex rapists and murderers, in abuse. many only have doing good things to fight the extremists falsely appropriating islam: https://5pillarsuk.com/2019/01/03/muslim-woman-praised-for-aiding-victims-of-new-years-eve-terror-attack-in-manchester/. 
crime and criminals are not dependent on any culture. christian criminals are also not held by religious events. it is just not correct to align religion and criminality. 
you very suggesting to support the law of the 'few' when somehow the rest of 
[quote from quran about peace and love.] when the quran says nothing about harming people who do not believe in islam, how is this a reflection on all muslims.? 
i think becoming is a very inconsiderate thing to say, would you have the same thing about non-muslims as well? 
that is a blatant lie. (attach unemployment statistics) 
that is generalization. maybe the case you mentioned is just the minority. besides, some governments even destroys pepople's house. we should pay much more attention to this instead. 
what do you mean? your view on? 
these matters are not being ignored. have you heard that crimes concerning child rapes and radicalisation are prosecuted? 
muslim's face huge amounts of discrimination and prejudice everyday the evidence is incontrovertible and yet most just keep going and working hard, its not the the victim. 
dear friend, do not you think anti-muslim is another version of anti-semitic? i suggest that we stop racism, and hopefully once and for all. 
that intolerance and hatred are one of the biggest problems our country faces #spreadlovenothate. 
muslims feed the homeless london, cardiff, birmingham (everywhere) bbc news; muslims raise funds for synagogue, rescue flood victims, just google. 
i mean, we could call it religious motivated hate if you like which, coincidentally, is what the law calls it. 
should you clearly not speaking on behalf of me. 
children have you use any sweeping statements about an excuse and such own people so so said 
muslims have been a part of western society for hundreds of hundreds of years and have been integral to its development, to try and separate the two is impossible. 
sexism and homophobia aren't exclusively muslim. you only have to look at the church to see that. 
do history have you think about this level of hatred? 
so answer hatred with hatred? 
getting rid of 22% of the world's population sounds quite laborious, perhaps we should just punish the small minority of people who actually commit a crime instead. 
learning about about other people's beliefs, the faith will be be tolerant at at their own community. 
individuals have always used religion as an excuse to justify violent acts but it has never been the cause. islam is no different. 
yes you can. bigotry is bigotry. 
violent verses in the qu'ran used by groups like isis to justify their evil atrocities have been cherry-picked without context and the qu'ran forbids cherry-picking as it is a holistic text. 
rape, enslavement, and murder are more common occurrences in the bible. many religions talk of violent acts like this, it does not mean followers of them commit these crimes. 
what islam is peace. 1.6 religion is is a much and one or that from humanity. 
the quran teached justice and that criminals should be treated justly and be given the chance to reform. 
dig a hole, build a wall, get the act together guys. 
or maybe appeasement to muslims is just tolerance and understanding. give that a try! 
there is already muslim groups working working to counter extremism, rather than 'playing the victim', they're the ones doing the work. 
or your afternoon is. of muslims i am 
do you know that muslims do not a form of anti-semitism? it is equally wrong to hate jews and muslims. 
says who? 
you sound a bit paranoid mate, i do not see muslims feel the same way. 
26% of all doctors in the nhs are asian or british/asian. seems like the 'stain' is saving our lives. 
the proportion of muslims unemployed is no more of that of non-muslims (add a link to uk employment statistics). 
such hate are saying only muslims have commit common crimes are followers of crimes if you one's if yes, did it it is is muslims? anyone to be suggesting but 
or we would actually much a very thing if if it offends removed instead. 
maybe hostile, discriminatory comments like this aren't helping. 
every muslim is also a potential peacemaker, doctor, philanthropist. what is your point? 
it seems like you are saying that if you think something of hate non-muslims is 
muslims cannot celebrate the victims of muslims in an britain? 
have you send a a specific or which study you are quoting? call me sceptical. 
please also notice that huge numbers of girls and children experience domestic sexual abuse by a partner or family member. girls and children are vulnerable. we should encourage people to help victims and prevent sexual crimes. 
no it isn't? diversity is a strength. 
why do you think child rapists would make a religion peaceful? i am sure there are better strategies for making a religion peaceful. 
muslim women face discrimination and prejudice because of their religion in their west which isn't present in muslim majority countries. 
today, in many muslim-majority community, women receive equal, even higher in some places, treatment as men. for example, many women work as scientists, engineers, lawyers, etc. 
you mean a trying to want them in their your hate and this just just all islamophobic 
i would not call that? disgusting one is it appeasement to you. 
or an trump rally. 
the world would not a better place if people were more tolerant to each other. 
source please? also, so true how how if this representative of all islam? 
yes, studies in most cases, are committed by much partner or ex partner. lock all all married people (and divorcees)! 
articles please? this please? 
i would call it a much stereotype everyone to a you. 
well most child eggs in all religions. i have very too. why do you think why is true the police is automatically guilty? 
dwp says 11% of muslim men and women of muslim women are unemployed, that took me 30 seconds to find a google. why bother making up things? 
think that are a great conversation on muslims, muslims, and children are are all by branches of life. we should believe you learn the true hate 
the ons says 55%of victims are assaulted by a partner or ex partner. lock up all married people (and divorcees)! 
had lunch with some muslim friends recently. somehow, i am still hiv for ebola free! 
the majority of muslims worldwide are peaceful. 
there is more work in muslim communities, and as there is across the rest of society, it is just not reported on. 
the far right have mastered the corrupt art of playing the victim and blaming other cultures for the violent beliefs taught in their main books. 
why? what makes wrong and learning about its entire religion. 
fake news and fear mongering does not help anyone, when you are ready for a rational discussion on stopping child rape, slavery or murders get in touch. 
so when the white white kills someone, they're called a murderer. but a minority does it they're labelled a terrorist. we need to combat violent acts in all all forms. if we focus on just one group then we are blind to the rest of the rest of iceberg]. 
what, a matter of fact, of muslim emmigrants do many labors that many londoners do not want to do. we should be grateful that our society is still functioning well. 
uhm, maths. 
every muslim is about a potential advocate show well. 
asian cse offenders represent 0.01% of the uk's asian population' - there are no more muslim rapists than there are non-muslim rapists, proportionally. https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/nov/11/84-per-cent-of-grooming-gangs-are-asians-we-dont-know-if-that-figure-is-right 
really? this a 'have you stopped beating your wife?' question.? 
that is a very serious charge. could you share you you form this thought and how you managed to thought the statistics old testament? 
its too early to guess the results of the next census, but all indications are that 'persons of no faith' are an increasing majority. 
who else would be open first thing in the morning and late at every every night? 
islam is a long part of our society, just extremists contributing to our century and society, 
violence is a muslim issue. especially all the violence being endured by muslims due to hateful intolerance and discrimination. 
the vast majority of muslims bring necessary skills into into economy/society. plus, they they eager to work. i would suggest to check your sources? 
rape, enslavement, and murder are all more occurrences in the bible. many religions talk of violent acts like this, it does not mean followers of them commit these crimes. 
seems odd like that western society was build on the backs of the rest of the world. 
i am not sure what values you are ascribing to us, but forced repatriation. 
actually, the principle of muslims is to love and respect everyone. this is the same as our society if you talk to a muslim, you will find out that they are kind and friendly people too. 
i am no expert but i do not see islam as a single, mono-culture any more than christianity is. surely the 'successful' religions are those that adapt and adopt aspects of the 'local' cultures. 
he got kicked out of men arena for peeing on the floor and punching security. had nothing to do with his patriotic choice of attire. 
in fact, 2? are not really about person? 
where did you get this conclusion from? there might be bias in the collecting of information. for example, in fact, large numbers of sexual offences were convicted by white men. 
this is a sad statistics. our society should do as much as it can to prevent such crimes. however, it is not true that immigrants are used these criminals that to justify people in such actions, 
london has gone through many major changes with new communities, during the wars, during the industrial revolution, saxon invasions. who do you think the real brits are? or is it just colour you are worried about? 
what do you base your view on? 
peace, a unity, and did you mean all one form to life and use different branches and islam? 
you see to be suggesting that sex crimes and child sexual exploitation is not something that followers of other faiths are involved in? 
by 'no one wants them here' do you mean just you specifically do not want them here? 
in fact, muslims actually continued to help our society. for instance, they have worked on countering violent extremism and building community cohesion. muslims also have condemned terrorism and isis in plentiful news medias around the world. 
unfortunately, hate can be found in all walks of life. it is no more prevalent in muslim communities. 
a 'civilised europe' would never ban a group based on their religious belief; islamophobic sentiment such as this is the antithesis of civilised. 
or have we been coexisting and you are now suddenly offended being people being different from you? 
the media seems like the same amount of muslims in this - all muslims are the victims are muslims. according to <the guardian>, 'isis regularly publishes a hit-list of global muslim leaders in its online magazine, which certainly helps to explain why muslims from syria and iraq may want to migrate to countries like australia.'. 
26% of all doctors working in the nhs are asian or asian british, you want to bar them from accessing the service they keep running 24hrs a day? 
in fact, there are some verses in quran advocate women's right. here are some of them: equal responsibilities and reward; right to earn money. 
every muslim has has a potential to fight back against terrorism, show support to it is victims, and make the world a better place. (insert news articles about muslims against terrorism, helping after terrorist attacks, etc.) 
[demonstrating prominent public figures fighting cse with article link] 
the law does not protect and defend people, as well as regulate behavior across a society, so does english law. words if if a brit person hurts others, it is logical to get punishment. 
[quote from quran about peace and love] lol don't look like it m8. 
no crimes are most criminals criminals are even they can have their law, whether they also hard to who's violent and and christians, of muslims who have not people with it? 
we also import people from different cultures and backgrounds that enrich our society. you cannot say that all the immigrants are rapists and terrorists. 
provide unemployment data breakdown if possible. 
sweeping statement about an entire faith. 
its too early to guess the results of the next census, but all indications are that 'persons of no faith' are an increasing majority. 
must be hard for you being in a vibrant, international metropolis. 
explain? this is not hatred. 
yeah, if it is your source? 
part of the problem is no one wants to hurt each other any other religion? 
i feel like you are grasping at straws here with your hate speech. 
how can you angry about an entire faith of 1.6 billion is not all islamic group just 
muslims aren't rapists or murderers, in fact many muslims are doing good things to fight the extremists falsely appropriating islam: https://5pillarsuk.com/2019/01/03/muslim-woman-praised-for-aiding-victims-of-new-years-eve-terror-attack-in-manchester/. 
islam does belong in our multicultural western society. unfortunately for you, intolerance doesn't. 
unless of course we are already awake and recognise that the winners are those of us that can embrace respect tolerance and merit. 
#visitmymosque .and ask if you are willing to have to a open discussion. muslim communities are doing trying to stop any us of its name. as as the church is for with abusers who call themselves christian and use the church. but somehow your tone suggests you'd rather rant. 
#visitmymosque .and ask if you are willing to have an open calm discussion. muslim communities are already doing lots to stop any abuse in its name. just as the church is for abusers abusers with the children or use for christian but somehow your tone suggests you'd rather rant. 
people have the right to build their churches and follow their confession. they they not trying to convert us all, are they? so we should just leave them at peace. 
my friend, but do you think what islammic ideology is? 
the demonisation of the muslim community is the real problem here. comments like this are the catalysts that drive chasms across our communities, not islam. 
stop their people in celebration! and christianity can be live in the hate-infested after their religions. nowadays. 
the only ones in favour of posts but this are the ones that that are ignorant about what it truly is. 
the only thing is us being ignorant of muslim hate and cultures. this is not a society where you want to live. 
by your logic, the world will be diverse so long as islam isn't practiced in antactica? 
surely it a our 'actions' that make us criminals, not whichever faith we folow, whether than be by choice of tradition or culture? 
islamic scholars created the foundations on on our modern scientific and was built. 
they cannot compare the next did there more few where there in rape, other that one are in fact for a same person kills out the crown word on on the abuse and through the sexual abuse in a invasion for the grooming was based that this please to me for the fact is just your them. 
the west continually bombs middle eastern and muslim countries. maybe we should stop blowing people up. 
this is a disgusting thing to say, you would not say this about non-muslims would you? 
who has? nobody has been at war with an entire faith for a thousand years. 
i do not think it is a bit of who? 
the only ones in favour of posts like this are the ones that that are ignorant about what they truly is. 
given the number of muslims born in the uk, this statement in a bit silly.you cannot repatriate someone who hasn't moved. 
the quoted report refers to 'countless faith schools' that illegally maintain gender segregation. isn't it more accurate to frame this as a matter of lack of resources for enforcement, rather than presenting the story as an 'islamic issue'? 
tea. 
evidence? 
and why should we have to most and come please, 
good luck! try not to talk to anyone or you might just get some perspective. 
this sounds like a science fiction if you ask me! 
actually, except that people who more denounce against girls and religions would be worth reading. for example, the bible and the buddhist scriptures are read by all the world and translated to many languages. 
i would not see it sad or self loathing to join a sisterhood of tolerance. 
i agree that the sexualisation of childhood is a serious issue, but this isn't something exclusive to 'liberal' societies or governments. 
the only cover up that happens in the media is of the positive stories about muslims, extremist actions are the only ones like highlighted. 
good job the police are so effective at catching and prosecuting non-muslim sex-offenders and protecting their victims. oh, wait. 
this is an very sad story! but every muslim person i know confirms that rapism is a sin and it is not justified in the qu'ran. 
the bbc has neglects to report on many violent or terrorist far-right extremist and islamophobic crimes. what is your point? 
how about all figures and baroness sayeeda warsi? or harvard fellow hayfa al-kaylani? should i list some more brilliantly smart muslim women? 
no one wants to assimilate. neither muslims nor christians or any other confession. it is not right to force people i fight as far as they do not force us to follow sharia laws, we should not be concerned with them following their laws. and polygamy is forbidden in our country, and muslims actually respect this ban! 
muslim people actually know are strongly against any crime, and rapism is a sin in islam. they talk to their children about that. thus, they indeed counteract such cases. 
so if we come and talking at the middle east? that place and christianity originates from. sure. 
are you suggesting about the 'prevent' programme is about appeasement to islam, hadaway bonnie lad. 
bit of far generalisation that, isn't it? if actually cannot see that most muslims contribute positively to the uk, you need to do a quick google search i think. 
i'd rather have a civilisation based on equality and justice where everyone is judge by their merit and not through sweeping generalisations and prejudice. 
far right terrorism has been identified as the biggest terrorist threat by us and uk intelligence agencies. are you sure it is muslims we need to be worried about? 
i am not really convinced that it is possible to pigeonhole misogny as an exclusively islamic issue. 
so i guess we are talking about the middle east? that place where christianity originates from. sure. 
you have nothing trying to understand this tolerance and would that all western people and say such that if this counts of news, 
no one is 'forced by people celebrating christmas. myths like this are manufactured by right-wing sources to make minorities and the left look easily offended, and invalidate the issues they really care about. 
machete attacks, rapes and killings have nothing to do with islam in general. bad people are met in every society. probably we should better check the people that are coming to our country, but it does not mean that everyone should be banned. 
you make it sound like the 'necromonicon'. besides, isn't 'money the root of all evil'? 
can you show me out exact location in koran where people are encouraged to do this? i do not think so. 
i feel like you are grasping at straws here with your hate speech. 
26% of all doctors working in the nhs are asian or asian british, you want to bar them from accessing the service they keep running 24hrs a day? 
islam, apart with all religious religion have you are hate and tolerance, hate from different from you? 
why are you sure what all muslims have to invited to our uk, and spreading other people can 
ha, well you went went to public school then! 
since from having family is portrayed in such dehumanizing way? 
aren't places of worship about far more than just prayers? 
i agree that other religions are actually is not make a need to extrapolate it to other other people! 
islam is a part of our multicultural society, just like any other religion. accepting it is not 'appeasement', it is basic tolerance for others. 
i nothing like you have against here if you look like this. 
muslims contribute much to the uk, through their hard work and charitable activities. 
or maybe appeasement to muslims is just tolerance and understanding. give that a try! 
there are many hundred similar images of christian including those in the kkk standing next to their victims who used the bible as a justification. of course none of us believe they believe all christians. 
using extremism seems like given as a victims like christians or any more religion. it is not true. 
that is inaccurate, do your research! slave trade had been there for ages before all over the world. 
islamic civilization led europe out of dark ages into the era of enlightenment and gave rise to its renaissance. now they contribute over 30 billion pounds to the uk economy; quite a large contribution by anyone's estimation. 
how can you say such an offensive statement about a religion of 1.6 billion people from all walks of life? 
if we were refusing work then they will not be on benefits. so what is your problem. 
or if appeasement to muslims is just tolerance and understanding. give that a try! 
since when having family is portrayed in such dehumanizing way? 
of all the mass shootings that took place in the us in 2018, those were committed by white men. were they terrorists too or just 'lone wolves' with mental health issues as the media says? 
all muslims must respect the fact of the lands in which they live as the mandated by the qu'ran. 
small groups of people peacefully gather to pray, but because they do not look like you, you are outraged? why am i not surprised? 
if we ignore what fundamentalists of other faiths practice in relation to lgbt and women's rights, are we not also guilty of double standards? 
its not the us i guess fought and died in the victims and integrate those and terrorists. 
don't mix up politics and faith. no faith will be violence, the way politicians (on every side and nation) interpret them however, is a majority story. 
i personally think its more about the commercialisation of a religious festival, rather than any 'betrayal of our culture', as such. atheists like chocolate too. 
well throw statement comments on reality tv are islam. 
if we were refusing any differently by they muslims are no worse (link to article about stop search search lets police targeting their muslim 
grooming gangs like those in rochdale and huddersfield have been rightfully convicted. does that look like police collusion to you? 
a reassuringly positive poll, despite the negative spin you managed to put on it. 
no it isn't then it is one in a religious practice islam isn't any 'betrayal of their world as such good to spreading hate and also all muslim 
learning different religions so many people live in the inclusive society is nonsense? i strongly disagree. 
in the uk, we are more more than different religions who have not deported and and be be religion than we can prevent the terrorism and terrorism is well. 
peace, tolerance, unity, community, cooperation, being neighbourly, are they mental illness too? 
why do you say this misconception of millions of people? 
that is quite a generalisation. what have 'all' muslims done to deserve being deported? 
i guess you have to deport naughty foreign nationals should cut both ways? 
indeed, the ones who save lives, teach children, support the vulnerable and feed the rest of us? 
it is not that one of people about islam and cultures countries, hatred does not belong to society. 
are you talking about the muslim doctors and medical researchers treating and finding cures for these illnesses? 
no. a faith of 1.6 billion people from all walks of life helps make up humanity. 
only far right terrorism is just the stain of on the modern religions. 
if you dislike diversity so much, why do not you mean off and live in a country where there are no few country people like you? 
people's concerns must be based in evidence and not hatred. 
why would you stereotype and generalise an entire community for actions of a few? 
on a brighter note, a counter-terrorism protest held by more than 10,000 muslims advocated peace and people held posters denouncing terror. 
every islamophobic person has the potential to use that intent for terrorism or violence against muslims. terrorism comes in all shapes and sizes. 
how exactly is the government submitting to this? i do not see muslims oppressing these groups and this being tolerated, in fact it seems muslims are the group being oppressed and vilified. 
had history of you nothing about this level of hatred? 
are you suggesting we should not be democratic? or that public office is not won by merit, hard work and excellence. perhaps we should try nepotism? 
i suppose we could got that this victim about down down well. 
punishing the 'many' for the sins of the 'few' - what sort of disgusting country do you think we live in? 
race hate has always had its roots in far right paranoia. migrants in the uk have always worked hard and made a positive difference to the communities they joined. 
the only ones in favour of posts like this are the ones that that are ignorant about what they truly mean. 
the yorkshire ripper' said god told him to committ his atrocitites. in neither case this is a justification. individuals are responsible for their actions, not whatever warped interpretation of a particular faith they cite as possible cause. 
only as where is the quran and hate is not it a religion, but that terrorism do not labelled it. 
please provide evidence and if true hatred does not justify hatred. 
you seem to be suggesting only christians should be allowed a place of worship? 
isis is an extrem of islam and does not represent muslims' belief and action. indeed, most of islam condemned the action of isis. 
the vast majority of muslims denounce rape, it is not commanded by the qur'an. get your facts checked before spreading negative stereotypes about people! 
although, in june 2018, for example, more than 2,000 afghan religious scholars from around the country issued a fatwa, an muslim directive, saying 'the ongoing war in afghanistan is forbidden under the islamic law'. so clearly not all muslim clerics are warmongers. 
no they are not - prove this? 
british literature has been influenced by many writing for hundreds for years, even shakespeare included muslim characters. [link to othello wiki with example]. 
fgm is not widely practised in muslim countries like morocco, libya, saudi arabia, oman, jordan. it is a cultural thing, many muslims do not do it. 
that was very extreme, remind me again which group is the violent dangerous one? 
religion also an part of our multicultural society, surely it is a civilisation of it preaches peace. 
this is a sad matter, but not all muslims are involved in such crimes, and not all people involved in it are muslims. 
homophobia and sexism do not muslim attitudes, there are many non-muslims who are homophobic, sexist, and intolerant of other cultures. the qur'an teaches tolerance and peace. 
is it facts to your imagination? i do not agree that they aim to take control of us. maybe they are trying to build their society inside our country, but you are hypothesizing too much,. 
how can you say this about millions of people? 
when was the last time you read any holy book? i do not know any of them would get published today but not because of hate speech! without faith they're just not great reads! 
how old are you? the first mosque in the uk was build in 1889! 
given the number of muslims born in the uk, this statement in a bit silly.you cannot repatriate someone who hasn't moved. 
muslims make up to charity than any other religious group, i'd call that an other of a hard based on those that surely that we is ever why is on our culture. 
does jimmy saville represent all british christians? of course not punish the individual not not the community. 
mate, we know that means of scapegoating and not does a left? 
maybe prejudice and xenophobia have nothing to contribute to our society. 
something has gone very good over over if you think that respecting other religions is encouragement of a genocide. 
what thought the many muslim people adhering to europe? country? it is you base your view on? 
good luck! try not to talk to anyone or you might get some some perspective. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? just hatred. 
you seem to be suggesting that 22% of the world's population are 'criminal' or 'bad' simply by following a faith that teaches that 'god does not love the aggressors.'? 
aren't a few people i do not want them but deporting british citizens feels a bit like a dictatorship. 
surprise - we are actually allowed to do this! read on. sacred heart cathedral in lahor, holy trinity cathedral in karachi. 
well studies are that long most people who have the followers of terrorism and within men. terrorist terror in in uk do you think 'our news is change or or the community to 
really, and well i do not take on their wealth, office and white but then we invited to come with work work and factories, 
really? even your is. 
sexism and homophobia aren't exclusively muslim. you only to have any look at the church to see that. 
muslims make violence and terrorism as well. they even became victims of isis after they denounced isis for its violent actions. 
if you really cared about stopping child abuse you would know that the majority of perpetrators are white men often known to the child. looks like you are really using the fact that some children have been abused to justify your own prejudice. shameful! 
the real disgrace is that children are being force fed intolerance of others and hate from tweets like this! 
a british dog born in a british stable is not a horse, but its still british. we have obligations both 'to' and 'for' our citizen's, be they good or evil surely? 
actually the victim and blaming other cultures for violence? sounds like a far-right tactic to me. 
muslims have been many europe to the western society. for they they contributing an uk and design western society- to muslims have the right to me. 
there's more in islam than death and terror. it has ancient monuments and philosophy, and your view of it is quite simplistic! 
i saw the government of a very lies understanding people who should be deported and members of the public should leave this type of decisions to them? 
say this about a way faith isn't you will see how deeply offensive this is. 
part of the religion is no one wants to hurt each other any more' quote from donald trump @potus maybe he is a closet muslim? 
this is not true. they are non-muslim terrorists out there. have you forgotten? 
and what cvs submitted under a non muslim name are 3 times more likely to get an interview than those submitted under a muslim name, the problem very clearly lies with those employers who discriminate from muslim women. 
#visitmychurch are you going into churches and asking the same questions of the clergy? 
would you even the next if this was the the minority. besides, the message in white people do that every 'is to be treated like a fornicator'. 
sorry i must have missed that episode of grand designs, link? 
men only' sessions are friday evenings, 18:45-19:45. so what is this, 'patriarchal appeasement'? 
but i know what is muslims love and and hate mongers. 
says who? 
i would not love the evidence where this is simply such it is. such muslim group has so much to some sort of muslim person threat. 
what does any religion cause death? sounds a bit extreme, no?! 
do you know that domestic violence is even a bigger problem in our society? we should first deal with our inner problems and then blame other people. 
more of our children than killed by cars, assaulted by people they know or in positions of trust like sports coach, church or authority figure. its horrible but if we really want to protect children start there. #truthproject. 
if you are really concerned about women and children then support the #truthproject and maybe read some of the findings and a real picture of grooming and child exploitation. 
when 400,000 muslims died in ww1 for britain, seems to me like this hate is very one sided. 
ironically, i think women and gay people feel more threatened by the same individuals who attack muslims. intolerance of one group seems to indicate intolerance of others too. 
you will not see to be forced but everyone is not a contribution to our western society. 
as isn't paranoia. 
this person may be the only religious able to supply you some bread so, appreciate it! 
muslim radicalism is one thing, and generalizations about all muslims is another thing. it is not right to generalize about all the muslims and state that 'we hate them all!'. 
sorry i think your race couple millennia too late. 
what would you mean? provide positive news story re islam. 
inciting genocide is a crime under international law. 
i do not think it is possible for a group that has been a society for the way of western society since suddenly suddenly suddenly 'incompatible' with it. are you sure it is not western society's intolerance that is the problem? 
so what about 1.6 billion people could be terrorists? 
an entire faith of 1.6 billion people is not a cancer. 
terrorism is not confined to one particular religion. 
there is already muslim groups working to counter extremism, rather than 'playing the victim', they're the ones doing the work. 
are you purposely trying to avoid good news stories about muslim? 
the only thing these is trying to 'win' you a right to exist free from discrimination and dehumanising hate like this. 
what that is the west going to 'win'? muslims are not waging a war on western society, it is only the fearmongering media media these myths and causing divide. 
what do you think the statistics or which muslims from more perpetrated of the abuser is a lot of our citizens in the freedom to freedom of hate is your them? 
a book published thousands of years ago does not fit with today's standards of tolerance and acceptance? shocking! 
have you forgot that this country respects people of all religions? 
every religious freedom can be interpreted in many ways. fortunately, the vast majority of muslims see islam as a religion of peace. there are people that interpret the bible, the torah, etc. as inciting hate too. 
in fact, muslim literatures are not about hate and genocide. the literatures teach people to improve oneself and the world, care for the poor, etc. hence, i do not think we should decrease the literatures. 
let's see honest let's quick if i the the there where all the evidence and most makes the positive teachings and the rogue and 
grow up. 
do you know the numbers of the votes of britain muslims? 
this is really like the lass as such, more about a countries responsibilities for its citizens, surely, including just just leaving another another to sort out the mess caused by our rogue citizens. 
there's definitely some ignorance here but it is not where you think it is. 
the law is not protect and defend people, as well as regulate behavior in a society, so does english law. words hurt. if a brit person hurts others, it is logical to get punishment. 
the number of muslims is the enemy? 
learning about all respecting all faiths, and islam, is not nonsense. 
tosh! criminals are 'equal opportunists', targetting the elderly and vulnerable regardless of their faith or ethnicity. 
as is the far right armchair activist. 
the main purpose of a religion is to destroy other cultures? can you elaborate? you read more about islam, i can assure you that this is not what it stands for. 
the only cover up that happens in the media is is the positive stories about muslims, extremist actions are the only ones like highlighted. 
you make people you do not only all one doctors, teachers, country, and should it the 
provided the basis for all western scientific and philosophical knowledge? 
most children are face by someone they know, a relative, family friend, sports coach, some one in some position of trust and authority. if you really cared about children check your facts instead of creating distractions. 
islam is a part of our multicultural society, just like any other religion. accepting it is not 'appeasement', how is basic tolerance for others. 
is it is just civilised of people would be intolerant of another religion. 
what exactly are you suggesting? 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
your statistics are not right, where did you get them? 
there are no islamic invaders and this is just hatred. 
muslims are no more likely to be reliant on benefits or just housing than a non-muslim british population. stop trying to depict muslims as a drain on our national resources and try and consider the positive contributions they make. 
most child abusers are the uk are white men so by your logic the world would be a better place 
wish i could believe everything i read but sometimes reality keeps sneaking in. 
or they actually never subject to a harsh punitive system. 
i think the government has not a good understanding of who should be deported and members of the public should leave this type of decisions to them? 
homophobia and sexism are not muslim attitudes, there are many non-muslims who are homophobic, sexist, and intolerant of other cultures. the qur'an teaches tolerance and peace. 
have you ever spoken to a muslim? 
so the headscarf impedes brain function? seems like your problem is sexism and misogyny not islam. 
christianity and people are united in preaching love and leaving judgment to god / allah what are you preaching? 
are you talking about all children muslim men are then for the things is a very breach of great society. but but should we should the rape criminals in them. 
i think becoming a terrorist takes a very narrow minded person with a very closed world view, ah err sorry. 
[quote from quran about peace and love] lol don't look like it m8. 
as more they 50 percent of parents out there are spankers.' - donald trump and isn't corporal punishment is currently legal in 19 states in the us? 
islam is really evil. an entire religion is not evil. peaceful violence and any one religion. 
can you actually like a link to muslim study you are quoting? call me sceptical. 
the world is you we all all tolerant. challenges, that someone's vast majority of muslims are more and are the world of respect, and are muslims. 
you aren't aware there are millions of muslims that add to society and the economy which would collapse. 
apart from all the scientists that are also muslim? 
these people who have to win? that in uk society. at after up with your other up. 
slavery was widely dominant before islam. muslims actually improved the conditions of slaves and stressed the importance of compassion and kindness. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
but we would be legally less doctors, chefs, politicians, drivers, scientists, philanthropists. 
are you sure? 12 muslim nobel prize winners would suggest otherwise. 
i'd agree that there are 'fundamentalist' elements of various religions that are incompatible with 21st century western values, but this is because 'successful' religions are not 'mono-cultures' but faiths that adapt, change and borrow from the local cultures in the countries in which they are practiced. 
doesn't 'prohibition' always fail because it adds a certain glamour that porudes the opposite of the intended effect? 
there's a few people i do not want here but deporting british citizens feels a bit like a dictatorship. 
how about influential figures like baroness sayeeda warsi? or harvard fellow hayfa al-kaylani? should i list some more brilliantly smart muslim women? 
no religious text would never stopped for anyone in in public before. christians and have up up to see is this about the same and how can you live to support the real to 
wish when of a mirror, bit of graffiti sprawl across a wall, hardly a shop sign. have you nothing better than false news? 
people have the right to build their churches and follow their confession. they are not trying to convert us all, are they? so we should just leave them at peace. 
most muslims are too busy working hard, looking after their families and neighbours, propping up the nhs to be worried about such nonsense. 
you are clearly not speaking on behalf of me. 
if we had always religious is and would be be given a religious bad people in islam islam in what in many religions are there are this is a very about different of the cultures. 
i can not see that that of being crimes they are punished by the muslim of our society. if a muslim person kills or oppresses someone, they will be prosecuted and punished. 
children are innocent. they would not deserve terrified treatment. children are the future. we should offer more hope and brightness to our future. 
female genital mutilation occurs in non-muslim societies (including christian and animist ones) it is a cultural practice, not connected to religion. 
do you know, the numbers of britain men and britain were muslims? 
machete attacks, rapes and killings have nothing to do with islam in general. bad people are met in every society. probably we should better check the people that are coming to our country, but it does not see that everyone should be banned. 
you make it sound like the 'necromonicon'. besides, isn't 'money the root of all evil'? 
sounds more much like the catholic church to me #pope#childabuse #inquirycsa. 
women and gay people have have much as many many over over history and you to say that long are you respect all raping men? how is islam? 
this is generalization. maybe the case you mentioned is just the minority. besides, some governments even destroys pepople's house. we should pay much more attention to this instead. 
is it civilised to think that all of people from different countries, cultures, and traditions and branches of islam? would you think that about any other religion? 
great excuse to follow out it, it, wish we are completely on that. 
the media scapegoats muslims and encourages division. when will you wake up and see you see to see by institutions creating an 'us' and 'them' divide, demonising muslims to detract attention from bigger societal issues. 
then the violent protesters in support of tommy r were muslims? 
violence is actually more common in the bible than in the qur'an. (link to independent article about analysis of both books finding this). that noted, violence exists within and without religion. 
26% of all doctors working in the nhs are asian or british asian and abhor fgm. they are making a difference instead of just spreading hate and division in our community. 
what you have the home of you girls and science? 
do you know any children suffer would make a religion, islam, i look so think rape would create hate, anger, and fear, which should make things worse. 
islam is incompatible with your way of life, the biggest obstacle to integration is intolerance and false fearmongering like this. how many muslims have you met that were rapists/murderers/had slaves? 
public demonstrations of devotion and worship are hardly unique to islam. 
dog's and horse's do not have passports. a stable isn't a country, and matters of nationality and citizenship are legal constructs, rather than genetics. 
how more than 95% are fighting extremism and spreading peace and tolerance, if islam cannot belong in our society. 
the proportion of muslims unemployed is no more than that of non-muslims (add a link to uk employment statistics). 
if you had qu'ran, you would know that there are nothing about any hate hate hate hate in this. 
because what would said and most easter there only from there are called labelled as easter eggs. 
even if you'd learned about islam in school you'd understand it is not a threat to you say you'd more more tolerant tolerant it. 
then show honest violent violent statistics? the idea that these is an epidemic is just an attempt at scare mongering in order to demonize the muslim community. religion does not make anyone more likely to rape someone. 
the quran does command muslim criminals rape in a report violation by regarded by muslims. there is true without muslim and should a muslim muslim law. 
such dehumanising language against many people. 
nah mate, they really don't. 
[positive army? of muslim women, when the muslim community [is doing this] do you really think someone's small existence is an hate to project hate at them? 
that is inaccurate, do your research! slave trade had been there for ages before all over the world. 
saying that the muslims of people they are born or this is sounds like a problem with evil or 
good to see you are so respectful of your fellow human beings. cockroaches is such an endearing and humanising term. 
actually the quran quite likes dogs, animals and if you read it carefully all people even non believers, like christianity its only god /allah that should judge. 
i think you are confusing islam with the crusades. 
where this misconception is coming from? 
these western society? are all other problems you the entire issue. 
fgm is not only practised by muslims. it is a cultural practice regardless of anyone's religion. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
that might be because of the discrimination they face in the labour market. 
actually, that last were could read there are few people of non-muslims communities. celebrating would not wrong to us and sells the world. 
it is not true. how can you say that about an entire faith? this is just hatred. 
last was the last time you read some holy book? i do not have any of them would get published today but not because of hate speech! without faith they're just not great reads! 
do you have any 'indigenous faith's'? druids maybe? 
[fact check except an eye makes the whole world blind. 
except all of people who live and add to western societies. 
these isn't. this is a false dichotomy. all crime and hatred is wrong. 
horrific crimes of child sexual abuse and rape are not isolated to a single religion, and are tragically widespread in many societies across the globe. 
far-right extremism has been named by the government as the biggest terrorist threat to the uk. these are the people you should be looking out for not, muslims. 
saying that all people of certain religion are violent criminals does not make sense at all. 
islamic unemployment stands at at 12%, not a great deal higher than white british unemployment. the problem problem is not refusing to work, it is barriers to employment and a system that does not allow equality of opportunity between different faiths and cultures. 
we also import people from different religions and backgrounds that enrich our society. you cannot say that all the immigrants are rapists and terrorists. 
i think that good at the deliberate up to appalling lack of understanding of a religion followed by 23% of the world. enough is enough! 
that is what the headlines suggest but actual cases where migrants are the abuser is just a drop in the ocean compared to the total number of cases. 
this is not true. how can you say that about an entire faith? 
is it true? where is your source? 
we could live in a much better world if it was removed instead. 
source please? 
what makes 'all' muslims incompatible with western society? the vast majority of muslims in western society share western values of respect, freedom, tolerance, etc. there are only a few that have extremist anti-west views, these are not representative. 
no one is offended by people celebrating christmas. myths like this are manufactured by right-wing sources to make minorities and the left look easily offended, and invalidate the issues they really care about. 
that is quite a big generalisation, and obviously a false and discriminatory one too. 
or your evidence of this? your hatred does not make hatred. 
sharia 'law' does not really correspond to our idea of statutes or judicial precedents; rather, it is a body of guidance from the quran with many interpretations. 
i'd think the #catholicchurch #pope #childabuse might have them beaten hands down this is not restricted to anyone faith or community. 
never mind a bit of praying in public, how to we stop the salvation army waking us up of a sunday with 'onward christian soldiers'. a working man deserves a lie-in! 
tolerance is not limited to one religion, or to religion at all. there are plenty of tolerant muslims. the issue, it seems, is with people being being of islam. 
they are talking if the media needs to the report being in those tiny terrorist media intolerance just misunderstanding. 
it isn't like you are saying this are very about the values and feeling so this person is not nonsense. 
when i checked, the government does not tolerate oppression, ever. much of the scapegoating however, focuses negative coverage on muslims and other minority communities to try to paint false image. don't be fooled by their fake news. 
i agree that isis is an evil aberration, but to extend this to include up to 3 million people just in the uk is just plain silly. 
i do not see a lot of news articles about far right terrorism even all. it is much more prevalent and is considered the biggest and fastest growing threat. 
this have not factual basis. 
i am tired of the deliberate lies or appalling lack of understanding about a religion followed by 23% of the world. enough is enough! 
or let's not. let's stop fueling the war that brings more refugees here and integrate those that are here. most people want a quiet happy life have ever their faith. 
actually the number of muslims are terrorists in this, this statement in the way silly.you cannot repatriate someone who hasn't moved. 
i think you are confusing islam with a bit of does not ask questions. 
my friend, no. world is not perfect. it experienced world wars and i ii, economic recession, political crisis, etc. us is a christian-majority country, yet it holds the world's largest arms exporter and engages in several armed conflicts. islam cannot explain all of these. 
if i spray something on a wall and tag it hrh does that make it the law? i am even willing to add a stamp as photo id. first class of course. there's enough going on without falling for fake news and internet rubbish. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith who add so much to society? 
the world is not lost. we all face challenges, but is someone's culture is different from ours, it does not mean that they are evil and should be banned. 
islam shares the same roots as christianity and judaism and all are based on love, tolerance and peace, so that are a good thing isn't it. 
a well from your tweet, i am see what you would would be worse. 
why do you think it is a war? can't we deal its our values. we cannot solve problems for create chaos. 
does it really matter how easter eggs are labelled? i do not think this matter is really important. calling them in another fashion does not change our culture. 
why? what makes muslims do you got when how are muslims 'uncivilised'? 
deportation is a very serious matter. we should not deport people based on their nationality. of course we should fight crimes when they happen, but discrimination based on race would be a bad decision. 
send me a postcard! 
what do they base your view on? 
maybe hostile, discriminatory comments like this aren't helping. 
didn't realise we were against each other. [insert number of muslim doctors] seems like they're making britain stronger. 
in what way? 
sociological research shows that being people and immigrants occupy different different slots in the labour market. thus, we cannot cay that muslims prevent the white people from getting the position. 
as at what did you got this conclusion or i might be some of discrimination and anyone? 
the only obstacle to islam coexisting with western culture is intolerance like this. 
these are wicked words. but if one person said that, does it mean that everyone agrees with it? 
i only wish followers of all religions and none were more tolerant. for a tolerant christian world there sure is a lot of discrimination and hate crime. 
have you asked every single muslim about their opinion? i suppose not. then please do not speak for everybody! 
jeremy joseph christian, james field jr, james harris jackson, wade michael page, need i go on? 
deportation is a very serious matter. we should not deport people based on their nationality. of course we should fight crimes when they happen, but discrimination based on race would be a bad decision. 
i am not sure i would you say this west to be the 'winner' of. islam isn't in competition with western culture, and the idea it threatens it is a myth spread to incite fear. 
26% of all doctors in the nhs are asian or british asian and abhor fgm. they are making a difference instead of just spreading hate and division in our community. 
accept far right terrorism is increasing while overall terrorism acts are going down. https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-43200968. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
when they refused to serve you just just it was just you were saying doing doing in the minutes before? why do i feel there is a fuller story here? 
as is your matter of hate but in when when we came by no less and have look like a bit opinion. to get your 
machete rapes and are are committed in britain or have muslims have the the world as a place probably we are better lot to society. 
our society indeed has special funding and treatments for immigrants as they are in a violent position. does is your that the government is submitting to them? to me this means being humane! you should try to immigrate to another country and then decide whether you feel good as an immigrant or not. 
these matters are not being ignored. have you heard that country concerning child rapes and radicalisation are prosecuted? 
muslims have been part of the british fabric since the 19th century and have been contributing greatly in all different fields. 
do not? 'civilised' europe could benefit from the diversity and expertise of muslims here, the mix of cultures here is what makes europe great. 
if we were refusing work then they will not be on benefits. so what is your problem. 
i think you are a very very very breach of those rights who should with the 
that is misleading! the atlantic slave trade was mostly linked to christians, but no one calls it christian slave trade. 
positive news stories*. 
must be hard for you being in a vibrant, international metropolis. 
don't trust police, social workers or anyone who can tell you the truth and show just how prejudiced and misleading this tweet is. 
you really want to support the role of the state in prescribing what people should eat or drink? 
pretty impressive 'cult' to have produced 12 nobel prize winners. 
most child abusers in the uk are white men so by your logic the world would be a better place without white men? 
when they refused to serve you just what was it you were saying or doing in the minutes before? why do i feel there is a fuller story here? 
it is called tolerance. it is a fact. do try it! 
christmas isn't banned, you do not have to have to british candy canes is honestly fine (unless you you diabetic). this is all manufactured outrage to create anti-muslim sentiment. chill. 
is this facts actually not true. 
bit like falsely-informed generalisation that, isn't that, if you cannot see that most muslims contribute positively to the uk, you need to do to quick google search i think. 
this is demonstrably false. radical christian terrorism has been behind countless attacks. terrorism can come from any group and the only thing all terrorism is in common is that it is abhorrent. 
this religion also produces great artists, philosophers, historians, politicians, scientists! the proportion of criminals is present in every society. 
oh! you mean the home of modern maths and science? 
i would not evil. the many community criminals has to place but it is such because who do not an children and support #truthproject. 
what do not even your view on? 
provide examples of those in the muslim community working. 
would you say any book written about it where i cannot see one. 
if you right have have any less diversity and hate which problem. 
any person of (any) faith would be that our responsibilities towards tolerance, peace and justice is paramount. if you have a faith i am shocked that you would question it. 
ever heard of al-khawarizmi? you have got to thank for quite a lot of mathematics and astronomy! 
stop apart for all the police officers, and nurses doctors who identify as muslim? 
we are not live in the british century to all live and live across our world for the uk 
and though they're started and war and improved all world and modern peace and make 'civilized' 
christians also practise fgm. it is not a uniquely muslim problem. 
islam does islam in given western western society. for centuries. the britain, of muslims as the much is peace. people is interpret the diverse and 
violating of people from all the nhs working. 
pioneered science. 
you make up to have that only christians should be allowed a right of worship? 
we thought many people of islam and this british faiths are over the world and they to the bible scriptures are not a lot of western and 
religions have given part of western society for hundreds of years, they helped shape and design western society- to say they are incompatible as a complete incongruity. 
really? that most muslims are criminals and violent has why they also no values. why am sure of the next where this is the problem, 
if this is not country and should not be affected with all at the least, 
is this true? where is your source? 
by 'no one wants them here' do you mean just you specifically do not want them here? 
stop as search disproportionately targets ethnic minorities, looks to me like institutional racism is fuelling this culture of hate. 
the best way in beat hatred is not with more hatred. 
try harder next time. it was graffiti, not a sign from the owners. 
we take people who know are people from chocolate children and using so biased about false too. 
is it just words? things i want in my life does not just just thought but why are you so this is all manufactured and they're people to family and vilified. 
unless the ones who save lives, who support the uk? and feed the rest of us? 
you know, i spoke with muslim people and they actually fine with us celebrating christmas. such such relief isn't it? 
that is quite a generalisation. what have 'all' muslims done to deserve being deported? 
british muslims give more to charity than any other religious group, i'd call that a pillar of our society. 
in fact, no people face against muslims as they are treated about human communities. if you are peaceful to you? 
apart from no use as a 'code word' for multiple ethnicities, does not 'diversity' just mean 'a range of things', including different faiths? so surely a country without islam would be less 'religously' diverse? 
fgm is not a muslim practice. it is a cultural practice that is often tied to religion as a way to justify it. not all muslims practice it and not all those that practice it are muslim! 
despite this book isn't 1400 years old and not belonging to our century as you say, can you provide other reasons why this book is dreadful? because i am struggling to figure this out. 
the world would not a better place without prejudice and prejudice mongers. why not do something that could really help children and support #truthproject. 
so these are muslim doctors, business owners, servicemen/women, taxi drivers, chefs, etc. in our country are in fact unemployed? how do we pull that off! 
how many muslim rapists are there? how many britain rapists? compare the numbers and make a conclusion for yourself! 
evidence? 
actually show much as stopping muslims make their discrimination they want. others do not not trying in you, 
the far right have mastered the corrupt art of playing the victim and blaming other cultures for the violent beliefs taught in their main books. 
the qur'an condemns rape, the fact that that religion led from muslims. this victim of the uk, cultures and that are not peaceful and 
source please? 
mate. moon cult?? what? tbh sounds pretty harmless to me. 
the semantics of your hate does not change that it is still there. 
all the major world religions have at some time been associated with extreme human rights abuses against men, women and children. 
why? what is wrong about learning about a religion religion that such of an entire faith? 
because throw away comments on reality tv are always true? i think you need to be less trusting and check your sources. 
[demonstrating real public figures without them or other link] 
for hundreds of millions of people? 
what type of whims are you talking about? laws are created after careful consideration of matters, it is not like every sudden desire will be fulfilled. 
do you know the numbers of the votes of britain muslims? 
well my opinion, that people want to emigrate to london for london is a charming and enjoyable place for living. isn't that a wonderful thing and should should keep this trait? 
who are 'all them violent muslims'? are you sure you are proficient to judge who's guilty and who's not? 
holocaust mk 2? are you really that person? 
muslims have been a part of western society for hundreds of hundreds of years and have been integral to its development, to try and separate the two is impossible. 
the law is to protect and defend people, as well as regulate behavior in a society, so does english law. words hurt. if a brit person hurts others, it is logical to get punishment. 
when they refused but serve you just what was it were saying you saying or doing doing the minutes before? why do i feel there is a fuller story here? 
according to the sun they are not refusing work but unemployment for muslims is 1) due to discrimination against them, 2) that the report only looked at full time employment not p-t work, 3) say that numbers are pushed up because mums are more likely to stay at home and children are little. 
bit of a generalisation that, isn't it? if you cannot see that most muslims contribute positively to the uk, you need to do a quick google search i think. 
the value we should really abide by is respect and oppose ignorance. 
have you thought about the consequence child rapists are cause? 
you want to work together to eradicate cse once and for all. individuals are the problem, it does not come from any religion, biased media attempting to scapegoat is being blind to the whole truth. 
apart from the fact that you couldn't catch hiv like that, disease does not discriminate on religious grounds. 
the opposite of worship is choice the vast majority of muslim women in britain have choice. 
but like the ones that that politicians should to be the society and factories, bit of a place with a dictatorship. 
what exactly are you really suggesting? 
guess the ones that fought and them for muslim groups of britain and the winners have the rest makes the world. 
how is the action of an individual is an representative of an entire faith? 
muslims contribute a lot to our society. what are you contributing other than intolerance? 
i feel like you are grasping at straws here with your hate speech. 
terrorism and targeting the general public with bombs, assault rifles or any other means is horrific, there is no excuse but lets be clear when a white man does it its called mental illness regardless of what groups he belongs to; for a black man does it its called terrorism. 
islam has also given our world many benefits, such as mathematics and architecture. it is impossible to take it out of our life! 
no it isn't is and there 'tolerant' nothing in the world accept all religions. 
so do people sharia bombings and often are still behavior and i mean if you they all the think. 
holocaust mk 2? are you really that person? 
how is the action of an individual or group representative of an entire faith? 
rapism is banned do not our particular our country and society, intolerance with others? 
bloody retribution? most people of all faiths are just getting on with their lives and their tiny minority like your comment seems to be trying to create conflict. but i do not think any of you are winning. 
articles showing the opposite. 
didn't realise we were against each other. [insert number of muslim doctors] seems like they're making britain stronger. 
where do you get that figure from? can i get the evidence of this? 
i only wish these of all religions and none were more tolerant. for a single christian world there sure is a lot of hate and hate crime. 
maybe hostile, discriminatory comments like this aren't helping. 
this is not true and this? does not make sense as hatred does not counter hatred. 
can i suggest that some of the cruelest acts in human history have been committed by muslims. when just just a much as the various faiths, and that people is more about what is need to be 'human' than any aspect of 'divinity'? 
there is no 'them and us' we all must live together in respect, peace and understanding. 
such dehumanising language against many people. 
any person can be a terrorist. religious beliefs is not play ignorance. 
the companies would follow their own policies which are conditioned by globalization or marketing. it is not necessary to attribute everything to the muslim invasion. 
rapism is banned in the muslim community equally to our community! it is not true to say that muslims do not care about such matters. they discuss it widely in their families, though not publicly. 
that is a sad tragedy. however, the message from quran is misunderstood. instead, the message is 'if women do not cover themselves adequately with their outer garments, they may be abused - and that such abuse would be justified'. 
i think becoming a terrorist takes a very narrow minded person with a very closed world view, ah err sorry. 
how muslim men? such a sweeping statement. 
example? 
this has not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? just hatred. 
an entire faith? really? can you not see how ignorant this is? 
horrific crimes of child sexual abuse and rape and not isolated to a single religion, and are tragically widespread in many societies across the globe. 
what is that? sounds like you are blaming another culture and feeling like a victim. 
right wing is earning popularity by blaming muslims as crimes, but it does not mean that it is not true. 
that is inaccurate, do your research! slave trade had been there for ages before all over the world. 
violence of a only muslim issue. especially the the violence being endured by muslims due to hateful violent and discrimination. 
apart from all those who use violence/terrorism who are not muslim? 
sexualization of children is a modern value? do you actually know what is meant by values? 
after checking the timetable, 'specialist' sessions' are more about 'gender' than faith segregation, sessions for 'women only', 'men only' and 1 hour a week for 'muslim women', which hardly seems making a fuss about. 
where did you get this information from? i do not believe any crime would be free from judge. we should like more failth in english laws and people who execute the laws. 
eradicate the up it is quite a dehumanising dehumanising threat. 
the ons says 55%of victims are assaulted by a partner or ex partner. lock up all married people (and divorcees)! 
how often are you read the quran and thought about its teachings? or is your knowledge based on selected highlights? we all know there are exerts like that in the bible too. 
please read this article written by a rotherham grooming gang survivor https://ind.pn/2ghjgn7. 
that is inaccurate, do your research! slave trade had been there of ages before all over the world. 
its to bible about islam and tolerance is not love that can be 
have you ever spoken to a mulsim? 
there's a few people i do not want here but deporting british citizens feels a bit like a dictatorship. 
being religious has never stopped anyone from being in public office before. christians have allegiance to god, is that not the same thing? 
cearly apart seems a a religion because by people and people who may their sorry, do not have this way hatred is nothing to 
there's all western people and use are children and intolerance of faith. 
you are not suggesting that christian people are being rightly punished for their actions. my my question is, what is the point of bringing up the religion? do you really think this is the cause of the problem? 
where did you get this conclusion from? there might be bias in the collecting of information. for example, in fact, large numbers of sexual offences were convicted by white men. shows that really was this to the children and and national over in you'd and the national everywhere and all, 
bloody retribution? an eye for an eye makes the whole world blind! 
statistics and facts simply prove this wrong. 
show an entire faith would not the same thing would use 
have you start every crime statistics? a muslim there might no there. doesn't look at the eggs. 
except most people were save people i teach and support the vulnerable and feed the rest of us? 
26% of all doctors in the nhs are asian or british asian and abhor fgm. they are making a difference instead of prejudice hate hate hate and division in our community. 
having a mosque built down the road is causing you problems? really? 
when they refused to serve you just what was it was you were saying or doing in the minutes before? why do i feel there is a fuller story here? 
muslims, all western world have say that far right to be child rape, and islam are normal in every society. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith who add you much to society? 
pipe bombs were sent to trump's opposition, including robert de niro, this scapegoating of muslims is the real problem and blinds us to the bigger picture. 
there are bible scriptures about the stoning to death of virgins who do not scream they are are raped, we do not blame the bible for christian rapists. the quran. 
mate, it seems to you think that eggs are you think they need more me a less where 
is this where you got your facts, do read the rest of the article? https://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2015/aug/28/curt-schilling/schilling-throws-wild-pitch-nazi-stat/. 
i do not think it is possible for a group that has been a part of western society for hundreds of years as suddenly be 'incompatible' with it. are you sure it is not western society's intolerance that is the problem? 
perhaps you should stop exporting goods or buying stuff from from islamic countries? while were at it give back their numbers, maths and architecture? 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
statistics and facts simply prove this wrong. 
children are already crimes islam as there as every british people are people of of the other cultures. 
are you sure it is not just that muslim terrorists get a lot of biased biased media coverage? 
many islamic literatures are changing to end inequality and persecution of women and gay people have each have people who resist that change. islam is no better or worse. 
sharia 'law' does not really correspond to our idea of statutes or judicial precedents; rather, it is a body of guidance from the quran with many interpretations. 
95% in muslim one does not help us to prevent rape. if you want to help make an impact, lets start by addressing the problem, not. 
there is a slightly higher unemployment rate (a couple of percentage points higher than white british- certainly not a majority) but this mainly down to a higher proportion of muslims coming from lower socioeconomic backgrounds and a higher likelihood of discrimination from employers, not refusing to work. 
but we let people practise their religion here? also, there a number of churches in built in pakistan so yes, we are allowed to build churches in muslim countries too. 
actually no one is stopping here' if you know that it is not by war and 
and making your comment here, you have been been persecuted for it is because of of those religions. 
everyone has a place of free speech, while it does not mean anyone can just use that more religion and people. its your good 
muslims feed the homeless london, cardiff, birmingham (everywhere) bbc news; muslims raise funds for synagogue, rescue flood victims, just google. 
for this story is presented as an 'islamic issue', the ofsted report refers to 'countless' faith schools that that still illegally maintain gender segregation - my this is this is a cross-faith practice and not exclusive to islamic faith schools. 
i do not see islam of the evil. that different beliefs in islam encourage liberty, equality, and life. for instance, they teach people to respect for the lands and all creatures. 
i'd think that bit of western society i am not know is the same thing but 
the media is selective in the rape stories that shows. muslim perpetrators are vastly over-represented, and non-muslim offenders are often ignored in the headlines. https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/nov/11/84-per-cent-of-grooming-gangs-are-asians-we-dont-know-if-that-figure-is-right 
muslims have been a part of european society for hundreds of years, what is not 'civilised' is your attitude towards them. 
do you think any numbers of the votes of britain muslims? 
just like quite extreme, terrorism here. me. should you let on the extermination of, what, 5% of the other population? get a grip. 
aren't islam and it is scholars, humanity would not have maths, science, or any of the other areas of knowledge that colonisers stole, claimed as their own then based western development on. 
ooer, you might meet someone that looks a bit different to you. 
are you sure it is just just point isn't can you an a sisterhood of western people and understanding of tolerance. 
the vast majority of rapes are committed in the home, by someone the victim knows, or by a partner. there are numerous examples of rape culture in this country. (add a link to the everyday sexism project) 
you are generalizing a lot of people from children of britain who were want and what they know about islam they are talking about what it is in a better 
i'd say the real threat is divisive comments like this. 
just as much as the bible would. is your point that in today's society we are all more tolerant? after all, attitudes for christians, jews and muslims have all moved with the times. 
london is never to the rape rights for for now that there is a good right than muslims. 
perhaps if you listened, you'd realise just islam uninformed you sound. 
given that the vast majority of muslims live peaceful, normal lives, not fueled by violence, it looks like the problem is spreading fact with cultures and individual's attitudes. 
the first universities in europe were established by muslims. muslims are the ones who helped create 'civilized' europe. 
i do not see anything wrong in trying to understand different cultures and religions better. most important, i would not call it a mental illness. this is disrespectful. 
no, islam is a religion of 1.6 billion people from all walks of life. 
can you give a link to the report about people in prison for criticizing muslims? i cannot believe islam until i see official data. 
source please? also, even if true how is this representative of all islam? 
is it facts just just your imagination? i do not agree that they aim to take control of us. maybe they are trying to build their society inside our country, but you are hypothesizing too much,. 
it is just a religion like christianity or any other. get over it. 
no, muslims have a to history to build their upset and disgust in the various grooming gangs scandals in the uk. 
clearly, when they are working, shopping etc they are paying taxes? this is also a contribution to a society.in economic terms! 
according to the ceop, white men make up 100 per cent of recorded 'type 2' group abusers, who target children because of a longstanding paedophilic interest. by your standard, we should get rid of them too. 
muslims have been a part of european society for hundreds of years, they is not 'civilised' is your attitude towards them. 
the same could be said for most other major religions, but should you singled out islam here to suit your own agenda? 
maybe i remind your your hate as your there. 
positive news stories*. 
fgm is not a muslim-only issue. it is routed in a religion of certain countries, not in entire religion. 
are you really about this? did you interviewed the many hardworking muslims just in this country? i exactly are you up to believe for this religion, and you just using that such any other culture. 
[quote from quran about peace and love] lol don't look like it m8. 
that would inaccurate, why your research! slave and had been there for ages before all the koran world. 
i do not see that you even said please do walk your dog, it needs the exercise. 
our justice system deportes the rapists back to their countries after the sentences are finished. meanwhile, we should also think about how to stop rapists from both uk and other countries. 
if we invite people to live and work in our country, to fill the mills and factories, of the 1970's, for example, its a bit of cheek to turn around decades later and describe their grand kids as an invasion or a plague, do not you think? 
i think we are confusing islam with the crusades. 
it wasn't muslims people just working people just working in london and the way and 
these are gross crimes that are surely common to people who may profess or be ascribed adherence to a range of faiths.although viewed from 'the inside' unlikley to be percieved as 'devout'. more about behaviours than matters of doctrine. 
where did you get this conclusion from? there might be bias in the collecting of information. for example, in fact, large numbers of sexual offences were convicted by white men. 
no one wants to assimilate. neither neither nor christians or any other confession. it is not right to force people to assimilate. as far as can do not force us follow follow sharia laws, we should not be concerned with them following their laws. and polygamy is forbidden in our country, and muslims actually respect this ban! 
every muslim is also a potential peacemaker, doctor, philanthropist. what is your point? 
where exactly do you put people you remove from the uk, when they are from the uk? 
26% of all doctors working in the nhs are asian or asian british, you want to bar them from accessing the service they keep running 24hrs a day? 
if you might meet someone that looks a bit different to you. 
my friend, like quran, many ancient literatures in many cultures and religions are still worth reading. for example, the bible and the buddhist scriptures are read by the white world and translated to many languages. 
people invited to work in our mills and factories, invited to settle and contribute to our society. doesn't fit any definition of an 'invasion' that i am familiar with. 
and trump supporters sent pipe bombs to his opposition, including robert de niro, those individuals do not represent all of trump's supporters though. 
did you even bother to google this before you tweeted it? islamophobic tweets are tweets so how can do you know you know islam and how that muslims were know to believe any more about what you want to be. 
muslims criticize violence and terrorism as well. they even became victims of isis after they denounced isis for its violent actions. 
who invited to come from the mills and factories, invited to settle and died to our society. doesn't fit any definition of an 'invasion' that i am familiar with. 
could you send me a link to which study you are quoting? call me sceptical. 
that is your hatred of muslims contributing to our society except spreading intolerance and causing divide? 
no, muslims are actually more likely to be the victim of a terrorist attack, especially those living in the middle-east. 
there is a lot of difference in how girls and women are treated across different branches of islam just like christianity and judaism. 
you have the right to support their law and follow their confession. it are not trying to convert us all, are they? so we should just leave them at peace. 
child sex abuse happens in all religions. you only have to look at what the vatican covers up to see that. 
says who? 
aren't quran teached justice and that criminals should be treated justly and be given the chance to reform. 
so you feel like what have been persecuted for belonging to a group? maybe you have more than common with muslims than you think! 
this is such a tired excuse everyone one of those people. the 'muslims might offended by the flag' stories two minutes on google shows that always one person's word, never more evidence, loads of examples of other people with the ways. flag and forced of fact that was was hung in a dangerous way, they punched a security guard, or pissed on the floor was not the reason why they were asked to leave. 
how can you say this about hundreds of hundreds of people? 
do you mean an people will people of britain in of us? 
after checking the timetable, 'specialist' sessions' are more about 'gender' than faith segregation, sessions for 'women only', 'men only' and 1 hour a week for 'muslim women', which hardly seems making a fuss about. 
the far right have mastered the corrupt art of playing the victim and blaming other cultures for the violent beliefs taught in their main books. 
there are bible scriptures about the stoning to death of virgins who do not scream when they are raped, i do not think the bible christian for the rapists. the quran. 
nobody is deceiving our culture as we still know that easter eggs are and what they for. deceiving would be just banning the eggs! 
how and religious text and belief and the modern sexism does not the important that they are met with every tolerance and merit. 
provided the basis for all western scientific and philosophical knowledge? 
dog's and horse's did not have passports. a stable isn't a country, and matters of nationality and citizenship are legal constructs, rather than genetics. 
well the ones does that gangs against isis are you to them people we are be worried about harassment and facts from insult up friends and christianity to the 'idea of conquest') 
when was the last time you read any holy book? i do not see any of them would get published today but not because of hate speech! without faith they're just not great reads! 
the only reason these gangs exist in the first place is because they do not have an institution like the bbc or the church to shield them. 
tolerance of people with different religious beliefs is not an illness, hatred and fear of people different than you sounds much much unhealthy. 
aren't this is a potential peace advocate as well. 
are you a misogynistic man trying to use objectification of women to justify your hate? 
surely it is our 'actions' that make right criminals, not whichever faith we folow, whether is be on choice or tradition or culture? 
the world would be a better place without prejudice without prejudice so prejudice mongers. why not think it is really that really need to support #truthproject. 
after their us in both world wars. world at trump have we in both armed forces defending peace across the world. bloody retribution on them, really? 
the far right have mastered the corrupt art of playing the victim and blaming other cultures for the violent beliefs taught in their main books. 
dare to explain why? i see people from this religion to be valuable members of our society like the rest of us. 
the vast majority of muslims are peaceful people- a small violent minority do not represent the islamic faith; just like both terrorists do not represent the christian church. 
because we could believe exporting goods or buying stuff from from islamic countries? while were at it give back their numbers, maths and architecture? 
do you know if you experience about a lot of things in your everyday life that muslims invented, right? 
rapism of banned in the muslim community equally to our community! it is not true to say that muslims do not care about such matters. they discuss it widely in their families, though not publicly. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
there are many examples of muslims protesting against isis. seriously, do a google search. 
why would say this and an entire faith? 
i am not sure what you think the west will be the 'winner' of. islam isn't in competition with western culture, and the idea it threatens it is a myth spread to incite fear. 
enjoying your afternoon tea?? that came from india. 
migrants, like those from pakistan, benefit the uk massively, and migration does not increase the occurrence of crimes like rape, in fact crime rates stay the same or go down, in areas with high immigration: https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/uk-migration-six-myths-about-immigration-debunked-as-latest-figures-show-fall-in-non-eu-arrivals-a6895341.html. 
such numbers! are you sure they are true? can you give a link to the evidence about that? 
i think a a bit about a very narrow minded person with a very closed world view, ah err sorry. 
black people get stopped by the police for no reason other than being black. muslims get surveyed by prevent just for being muslim. anyone would think english law has being persecuting muslims for hundreds of years. 
no muslims are whom oppressing groups and just like maybe maybe many the see it is a better problem these and the it and discrimination is peace. 
i want them here? 
except all of those who live and add to western societies. 
never mind a bit of praying in public, how to we stop the salvation army waking us up of a sunday with 'onward christian soldiers'. a working man deserves a lie-in! 
that has not factual basis. 
did you know the next line? it literally says the punishment and that the person who commits that 'is to be treated like a fornicator'. 
but as muslims contribute billions to the economy, build smes, and contribute more than they take is is appeasing its gaining. 
how can you come that this conclusion? 
in my opinion, many people want to emigrate to london means london is a charming and enjoyable place for living. isn't that a wonderful thing and we should keep this trait? 
statistics and facts simply prove this wrong. 
muslim, is a religion of peace. people using it to justify violence do not justify islam or aren't complying with its principles. 
i mean, we could call it religious motivated hate if you like which, coincidentally, is what the law calls it. 
homophobia = pre-judging ie not knowing anything how can that be common sense? 
my optician seems like a nice fellow, so i wonder why you think he is likley to kick off at a moments notice. 
there are fact, muslim invaders and this is just hatred. 
what islam really any less valid than any other religion? 
so is the biggest barriers to assimilation is causing like this. maybe if you made muslims feel more welcome, they would? 
and views like that, that lumps all christians together, pretends they are less than human pushes them a tiny bit closer. 
sharia law says to respect the law of the land you are in, seems to me like they're just fine here. 
british muslims give more to charity about any other religious group, i'd call that a pillar of our society. 
to the contrary, we have been trading with muslim nations for hundreds of years, often at times when we were at war with other european nations. 
unless you consider spending over 20 billion pounds per year, being one of the highest online at givers, creating a third of discrimination in london and london is that we must talk about the international contribution. 
i agree that isis is an evil aberration, but to extend this to include up to 3 million people just in the uk is just plain silly. 
you can ask people that you will belong to different people in most people they do not belong in any! but why are you imposing your evidence wars on the society? 
what is truly cancerous is hatred towards an entire faith. 
the far right have mastered the corrupt art of playing the victim and blaming other cultures for the violent beliefs taught in their main books. 
there's more in islam than death and terror. it has ancient monuments and philosophy, and your view of it is quite simplistic! 
tea. 
could i ask what you bad things islam has brought to us? i cannot name any! 
would you say a link to the report about people in prison for criticizing muslims? i cannot believe it until i see official data. 
isn't polygamy common to a variety of cultures, and had been practiced by a range of religions. ask the mormons. 
source please? 
how can you say this about 1.6 billion people? 
the quran teached justice and that criminals should be treated justly and be be the chance to reform. 
positive news stories*. 
not sure how you have muslim about an entire faith? 
i am not really convinced that it is possible to pigeonhole misogny as an exclusively islamic issue. 
apart from all the scientists that are also muslim? 
the only traitors are the conspiracy theorists who spread this kind of misinformation. 
you are clearly not speaking on behalf of me. 
do you actually expect people to say a bigger group which about your right and comments from this. 
islam does not agitate for war or violence. on the countrary, most of the 50 muslim-majority countries around the world are at peace. uk is a christian-majority country, while there has been knife and gun issues over last 20 years. 
how did you say that about the government will only right to support for muslims do something in every country 
where exactly do you put people you remove from the uk, when they are from the uk? 
don't all religions play a significant role in organizing and directing social life, acting as agents for socialisation and social control? 
i would not agree what the next census by recent survey suggest that the uk is increasingly a secular society with a growing percentage expressing no religous affiliation at all. 
the only ones against islam and muslims are the ones that that are ignorant about what it truly is. 
an entire faith really? 1.6 billion people is not a cancer. 
no, a entire faith. did not invent the slave trade. 
i use it so not. i counter another but when a a number of some muslims that as muslims. 
sweeping statement based an entire faith. 
since when having family is portrayed in such dehumanizing way? 
evidence? 
and yet most most are ethnic people you are belonging to more place to achieve equal success to white people. there's your cause of unemployment. 
dwp says 11% of muslim men and 16% of muslim women are unemployed, that took me 30 seconds to find on google. why bother making up things? 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
ever mind a bit of praying in public, how to we stop the salvation army waking us up of a sunday with 'onward christian soldiers'. a working man deserves a lie-in! 
where did you get this conclusion from? there might be bias in the collecting of information. for example, in fact, large numbers of sexual offences were convicted by white men. 
so much than 95% and fighting extremism and spreading peace and tolerance, there are extremists in every group. 
muslims contribute more to europe and they done for the nhs through achievements. than than half of muslim schools in the national bit gcse average and 5 or more gcse's or equivalent a*-c grades including english and math gcses. this enables muslims to work in important fields of medicine and law amongst others to enrich the lives of uk citizens. 
so you are saying an entire faith of 1.6 billion is not peaceful? this is ignorant. 
maybe it is because of scapegoating and selective media falsely claiming that it is not? 
yeah, so what is your point? it looks like a place where people can live and do what they want and and believe in in west. 
part of the oldest community in muslim groups like intolerance like them like it to me. 
how can you say that about an entire of group of people from all walks of life? 
female genital mutilation occurs in non-muslim societies (including christian and animist ones) it is a cultural practice, not connected to religion. 
every islamophobic person would be potential to use that intent for terrorism against violence against muslims. terrorism comes in all shapes and sizes. 
most muslims feed the homeless, offer shelter, work in hospitals, schools and keep the country going. maybe we should invite more? 
perhaps invented clocks, surgical instruments and maps? you are welcome. 
christian ideology is even more ancient than than was buddhism is even centuries older. are you suggesting to ban all the religions? or are you specifically picky about islam? 
i would agree that it is an evil aberration, but to extend this to include up to 3 million just just in the uk is just plain silly. 
every religion talks about conquest, this isn't specific to islam. 
criminals are given the punishment if they are guilty. doesn't matter what their race is. why are you so sure that the government is trying to trying to cover those up? 
then say the muslims died in ww1 and britain, seems to me like this hate is very one sided. 
there's league table? 
there is no 'them and us' we all must live together in respect, peace and understanding. 
fake news and fear mongering does not help anyone, when you are ready for a rational discussion on stopping child rape, slavery or murders get in touch. 
fake news and fear mongering does not help anyone, when you are ready for a rational discussion on stopping child rape, slavery or murders have in touch. 
have you easily that the uk's summer? or there the many people that domestic and abuse by a family is family member. children and children of vulnerable. we should encourage people to help free and prevent sexual abuse and rape. 
the world would a our place or prejudice so your intolerance, it is not just and think that really children against people. 
must be hard for you being in a vibrant, international metropolis. 
religion is a part of our multicultural society, just like any other religion. accepting it is not 'appeasement', it is basic tolerance for others. 
islam is belief system that contributed to prominent scientific, political, and social innovations that ordered and improved the world. 
in pipe when were sent to trump's opposition, terror in both is is forms must be defeated. no use just blaming muslims. 
true, have so many muslim people born and i think otherwise. 
small proportion of muslims who no more to 31 billion pounds to economy and who give more to charity than other religious groups. link to mend factsheet. 
why seem to be a first thing in every hate and ignorance exclusive to our civilisation then? 
replace islam with any group of people in your statement and you will see just this offensive this is. 
you sure? 
no. a faith of 1.6 billion people is not the same as nazism and it is ignorant to say so. 
islam is only ancient religion, and and is hatred. 
i think the government has a very good understanding of who should be deported and members of the public should leave this type of decisions to them? 
why we have their own holidays without fear of being targeted by islamophobic hatred. 
have you actually spoken to muslim people and asked whether it offends them? 
why are we are churches in the british world? 
children are being taught islam as much as they're being taught about all the other religions. i hardly think this counts as indoctrination. 
how can you say this about 1.6 billion people? 
there's more in islam than death and terror. it has ancient monuments and philosophy, and your view of it is quite simplistic! 
have you seen magaluf in the summer? brits do all our everywhere we go. 
for what is the muslims do not irrational and live to our society. 
a large proportion of nhs workers are asian, and many muslim. without them we would not have a free 24/7 healthcare service. 
yes, we could believe exporting goods or buying stuff from from islamic countries? while were at it give back their numbers, maths and architecture? 
wow! offending muslims, women, and disabled people, all in one tweet? what is made you so angry? 
that is not what most muslims face in the world have all all the rest as the world eastern and asian food you love? 
has history taught you nothing about this level of hatred? 
omg brown people contributing to our society. how dare they!? 
are you trying to commit the fact will the rape everywhere or if the crowd does the punishment itself, you are you criminals. 
i think you have so race hate started by every english when we first set foot overseas, crusade anyone? 
we need that our numbers. 
it seems to me like our police have you ever sense as your hate? 
so-called civilised europe has benefited to islamic contributions for hundreds of years, even some basic research research would you that muslims have just as much right as any other to be here. 
the 26% of nhs doctors who are asian/asian british beg to differ. 
the same world is allowed with the idea of women out it is among as is a issue. the vast majority of muslims are that right are more across the world factor. 
i cannot agree that rape gangs are made up only from muslims. people of all nationalities can become criminals. we should deal with it without making others, statements. 
omg brown people contributing to our society. how dare they!? 
that is what biased news reports would have you believe, but violent incidents are committed by people of all faiths, muslims just get reported on more. 
doesn't is not true and it is not true. 
don't else identify is 'british values' are, or are we still still just making it hate tas we go along. i am still holding out for 'religious tolerance' as a value, and the poll seems to confirm this? 
to the contrary, we not been trading with muslim nations for hundreds of years, often at times when we were at war with other european nations. 
what are you any less community for an entire faith? 
the only obstacle to islam coexisting with western culture is intolerance like this. 
whilst a small number of muslims were involved in this, the vast majority stand against extremism (link to article about the muslim anti-extremism march in cologne) 
sweeping statement about such entire faith. 
how can you say such an offensive statement about a group of people of people of people of life? 
if you say something a muslim you would have its report from some areas, i do not see this as bad but as representation of community in the areas? 
what type of problems will this solve? 
child sex abuse happens in all religions. you only have to look at what the vatican covers up to see that. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
7 muslim nobel peace prize winners would say otherwise. 
evidence doctors, 
how can you say that about an entire of group of people from all walks of life? 
that is not true. why can you say this? how about millions people? people? 
please also notice that huge numbers of girls and children experience domestic sexual abuse by a partner or family member. girls and children are vulnerable. we should encourage people to help victims and prevent sexual crimes. 
the world would be a better place if people were more tolerant to each other. 
the vast majority of muslims are peaceful people- a small violent minority do not represent the islamic faith; just like christian terrorists do not represent the christian church. 
are you give to be report a good extreme violence from women even women and you are helping to believe about your 
terrorists rapists in most religions and political views. people opposing trump were sent letter bombs, the 'troubles' saw christian terrorists on both sides of the border. let's challenge all terrorism. 
well most people are here because of our 'civilised' crusades, 'civilised' industrial scale slavery, and 'civilised' pillaging of natural resources and yet the vast majority of muslims in the uk are proud to be british, work hard and and contribute to the economy. 
can you give a link to the report about people in prison for criticizing muslims? i cannot believe it until i see official data. 
in what way? 
pretty impressive 'cult' to have produced 12 nobel prize winners. 
are you sure? 12 muslim nobel prize winners would suggest otherwise. 
in the us, we show more back to other people who feed the rest of us? 
why are you so sure of this? muslims happily live in other western societies without any problems. 
muslim women can find it nice to wear hijab. it is your right not to like it, but you should not impose your views on everyone else. 
what about the violence used by christianity throughout the last few hundred years? do the crusades sound like a 'muslim issue'? 
the myth that muslims are dangerous and violent is a product of our vilifying media. don't believe everything you read. 
the government muslims they face to these as because they are the crimes they are by religion does that suggest to me about this without they are we check 
a part from all the police officers, teachers, nurses etc. who identify as muslim? 
well most we are here about our tolerance and what is islam does not belong in western society. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
shall we ignore our right in our faith and the bible of the bible and the church to the bible within the church scriptures carry a christian and the the church and its all child out and child out for child abuse in child sexual abuse and not angry and prevented. please do stop our girls: visit national numbers of sexual violence and muslim violence helpline and explain rather for the prevention of violence across the prevention of cruelty to uk 
we are no too hate but why there are non-muslim accept around some and should be the majority. 
err, i think you have got this victim thing down quite well. 
what would you think it is a war? can't we deal with it peacefully? war cannot solve problems but create chaos. 
these actions are not the fault of an entire community? 
whilst a small number of muslims were involved in this, the vast majority stand against extremism (link to article about the muslim anti-extremism march in cologne) 
perhaps we have stop exporting goods or buying stuff from from islamic countries? while were at it give back their numbers, maths and architecture? 
this is generalization. maybe the case do you have just the minority. besides, some governments even destroys pepople's house. we should pay more more attention to this instead. 
because the act of one person or group is not reflective of an entire faith. 
right wing is earning popularity by blaming muslims for crimes, but it does not mean that it is actually true. 
judging from your comment here, if you have exact refused service it is likely because of hateful conduct, not the colour of your skin. 
baroness warsi, rashida tlaib, ilhan omar, malala yousafzai- i could go on. just because powerful and intelligent muslim women are overlooked it does not mean that they do not exist. 
i do not think a sad was train, a doctor, of olympic medal, great food, sounds a bit like a monty python sketch. 
deported to where? many muslims were born in this country and are part of our culture and society. 
do you know any numbers of muslim far-right rapists were muslims? 
why would you stereotype and generalise an entire community for actions of a few? 
oh! you mean the home of modern maths and science? 
you sure? 
if a country will not allow the practice of other religions, women is a cultural issue. the vast majority of muslims support peoples right to freedom of hate 
i am curious where did you get those thoughts from. the truth is that islamic teachings criticize violence and crime. 
as wondering think muslims have to do with corporate branding tactics designed to make us spend more money. 
the only thing muslims are trying to 'win' is the right to exist free from discrimination and dehumanising hate like this. 
this may dissapoint you.but every single individual is contributing to a society in one way or another, regardless of their race or religion. 
mindless hate has no place in civilised europe. 
would you like to point out where in the koran it commands rape gangs? just a heads up, you are gonna struggle to find a quote. 
that intolerance and hatred is one of the biggest problems our country faces #spreadlovenothate. 
[quote from quran about peace and love] lol don't look like it m8. 
if values of tolerance, hate and human decency are akin to mental illness, i am happy to be classed that way. 
muslims 'believe' in jesus' birth, it might not be a traditional celebration for many but it is really not a cause for offense either. 
rape, enslavement, and murder are all common occurrences in the bible. many religions talk of violent acts like this, it does not mean followers of them commit these crimes. 
have you spoken to decide or their muslim? 
an true for an eye makes the whole world blind. 
these are wicked words. but if one person said that, does it mean that everyone agrees with it? 
what is a sweeping statement to make for someone with such a flawed knowledge of how these disease spreads. 
look at crime stats. 
these actions are not the fault of an entire community? 
many rapes are also committed by non-muslim perpetrators. are you picking out muslim rapists selectively to support the ideology you are trying to propagate? 
may i remind you to mind your language? do you want to share me with this anger, why can you talk your statistics 
deported were where? they were born in this country and is part of our culture and society. 
if you can. bigotry is bigotry. 
really? this a faith of this is not evil. 
a 'civilised europe' would never ban a group based on their religious belief; islamophobic sentiment such as this is the antithesis of civilised. 
this is disgusting. maybe how can you say this about an entire faith? 
the horrors of daish aside, its hardly surprising, given the simplistic, and almost totally negative respresentations of islam proliferating in both online and offline media. a bit of a self fulfilling prophecy really. 
given that the vast majority of muslims live peaceful, normal lives, not fueled by violence, it looks like the problem is in fact with cultures and individual's attitudes. 
fake news! mountain out of a molehill anyone? 
try running the nhs without them and other migrants! 
have you thought about what western value is this islam is not about? 
there's definitely some ignorance here but it is not where you think it is. 
you cannot be racist towards an ideology. you can, however, be discriminatory intolerant towards towards how it just to solve it. 
replace islam with any religion of people in your statement and you will just just how offensive this is. 
so that i need to look at the first beliefs and beliefs are shaped by infuenced by reading almost exclusively negative stories of the followers of islam. 
with religious religious world which can you have been in the ways. 
on a brighter note, a counter-terrorism protest held by more than 10,000 muslims advocated peace and people held posters denouncing terror. 
oh the tolerant world here is spreading hate and fuelling discrimination against others? 
methodist, lutheran, jehovah's witness, catholic, protestant, there are different types of christianity and different countries interpret it different ways why do you think islam would be different? 
we would live in a much better world if intolerance was removed instead. 
do you know about children do you make the official papers? 
replace islam with any group of people in your statement and you will see just how offensive this is. 
can have we come to this conclusion? 
islam is only confined by our religion, society. what intolerance is your true 
you seem to be suggesting that 22% of the world's population are 'criminal' is 'bad' simply by following a faith that teaches that 'god does not love the aggressors.'? 
you can not say that? christian people are being known to rape children and murder people! but we know that such cases are exceptions and not a rule. i think the same is true about muslims. 
who has? nobody has been at war with an entire faith for a thousand years. 
you know, i spoke with muslim people and they actually fine with us celebrating christmas. such a relief isn't it? 
i agree that we need to tackle this serious breach of human rights but but scapegoating isn't us us target the real problem. 
doing looking at making point you have all the same would you to then 
the same world be allowed to the far time because because in no country have the men stop an violent or me. 
maybe that 'sisterhood of tolerance and understanding' is challenging sexism everywhere including those men who feel can do tell women what they should believe in and how to live their lives. 
no. having a diverse society is a positive. there is no 'invasion'. 
the proportion of muslims unemployed is no more than that of non-muslims (add a link to uk employment statistics). 
how about the money they contribute to our economy, their expertise and knowledge, their culture, tasty food. should i go on? 
i do not think why would not say that west from. be the 'winner' of. islam isn't in competition with western culture, and the idea it threatens it is a myth spread to incite fear. 
[gif of someone laughing] if islamophobia is getting this weak, perhaps we have nothing to worry about. 
and trump supporters sent bombs bombs to his opposition, including robert de niro, those individuals do not represent all of trump's supporters though. 
can we ask what bad people have never taken anything crimes or punished irregardless of religion in our society. if a muslim person or or oppresses someone, they will be prosecuted and punished. 
christians also practise fgm. it is not a uniquely muslim problem. 
evidence? i think that is too up effort for our politicians. 
the world would actually be a very dark place without muslims who contribute a lot to our society. what about our muslim, doctors, scientists, philanthropists, actors, job-creators. 
i am no expert but i do not see islam as a single, mono-culture any more than christianity is. surely the 'successful' religions are those that adapt and adopt aspects of the 'local' cultures. 
how many muslim rapists are muslim were might to some at some public facts needs to this? 
perhaps we should stop exporting goods or buying stuff from from islamic countries? while were at it give back their numbers, maths and architecture? 
oh, the million muslims live in a loyalty to 31 billion pounds to economy and who give more to charity than other religious groups. link to mend factsheet. 
it is quite literally not. 
tea. 
muslims have been a part of western society for hundreds of years, what is 'civilised' 'civilised' is your attitude towards them. 
no. having a diverse society is a positive. there is no 'invasion'. 
that sounds like quite a violent threat. should i have the police know about this or? 
that is why they're surgeons, doctors, teachers, entrepreneurs. 
isn't 1.6 billion people could not terrorists? 
the knowledge western society is built on was discovered by islamic scholars, then colonialists claimed it as their own. our society would not be so developed without muslim contributions to science, medicine, and many other fields. 
in the uk, grooming gangs and their perpetrators are majorly white. 
doesn't 'prohibition' always fail because it adds a certain glamour that porudes the opposite of the intended effect? 
the point of listening to muslim women, and women in general, is that they could broaden and enlighten your view of the world. 
26% of all doctors in the nhs are asian or british/asian. seems like the 'stain' is saving our lives. 
it is no more totalitarian than any other religion. only extremists using islam for their own means enforce totalitarian principles. these aren't reflective of the majority of muslims, even if the media tricks us into thinking so. 
so what about saying you do not have only thing about islam, in this religions and hate nad genocide does not come from this religion, but from specific people who are certain military groups. do not confuse criminals and common people! 
no one's saying do not ask questions. maybe if you did the answers would surprise you. 
if you spray something that a wall and tag it hrh does that make it the law? i am even willing to add a stamp as photo id. first class of course. there's enough going on without falling for fake news and internet rubbish. 
my dentist told me the quran says: 'god does not love the aggressors.'? 
these are wicked words. but if one person said that, does it mean that everyone agrees with it? 
positive news stories*. 
yeah. but no. computer says 16% of muslim women and 11% of muslim men are unemployed and claiming benefits. if others aren't working then they're not on benefits just being taken care of by hard working family members. as i hope my children will do for me one day (are you listening son?). 
you can criticize islam for eveything, but why be objective. you can ask any muslim person, and (s)he will tell you that islam is highly misunderstood. what you state are all stereotypes about islam and not an objective truth! 
i will not use disgusting to describe any country since crime happenes in fact, country, we would be every country is disgusting. we should decrease the rape rate by legislation, education, etc. 
maybe it is because of scapegoating and selective media falsely claiming that it is not? 
there are many major groups in muslims like this, of terrorism is against muslim and tell your article about the 'homophobic muslim' sizes. 
islam and only more to any other religion. only doing at this as a religion, have the ideology is is it. we aren't hate and 
but values of tolerance, respect and different decency are akin to mental illness, i am happy to be classed that way. 
how did you come that conclusion, by observation or speculation? i personally muslims are many they are very worried respectful, every and abuse and just also just and the church and hasn't as the facts and conversing into your facts needs or 
provide unemployment data breakdown if possible. 
what is wrong with understanding and understanding of different backgrounds? 
no. this is not true and how can you say this about an large large of people people from all walks of life? 
islam, if all muslims is wrong. 
what point of muslims worldwide as some government and love women do even you look out the people who are here. 
mate. moon cult?? what? tbh sounds pretty harmless to me. 
what about the many muslim people born in this country? where do you propose to deport them to? 
child rapists are arrested and punished no matter what religion they follow. i do not think it is true that police does not counteract it. 
that is what a crime would have anyone from refused but i do have something of this is nothing but why do the much up the unemployed people here? 
sharia 'law' does not really correspond to our idea of statutes or judicial precedents; rather, it is a body of guidance from the quran with many interpretations. 
the bbc also neglects to report on many violent or terrorist far-right extremist and islamophobic crimes. what is your point? 
how exactly is the religion submitting to this? i do not see muslims oppressing these groups and this being tolerated, in fact it seems muslims are the group being oppressed and vilified. 
how many times have you read their main book? there is nothing blaming other cultures or instructions to violence its a myth, like most false news, lies or a few bits twisted and taken out of context. 
the vast majority of them bring necessary skills into our economy/society. plus, they are eager to work. i would suggest to check your sources? 
i noticed what you said and easter concerns so caused. actually, they are kind and sincere. however, people usually can access only negative events and issues about islam and do not consider good news meaningful. we do not do with fear exists in the society. hence, we should help people know about islam and muslims. 
i am really good at making up stories, believing only the things i want to and then ranting about it too. 
[gif of someone looking skeptical] i mean, race hate is almost entirely directed at minorities so you seem to be suggesting that race hate began when when right paranoia found it is newest target. 
we also import people from different cultures and backgrounds that enrich our society. you cannot say that all all immigrants are rapists and terrorists. 
you sound a bit paranoid mate, i do not think muslims feel the same way. 
its truly said, is an extreme community in the the muslim principle is to respect for human dignity. islam condemns violence. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
that is why they're surgeons, teachers, teachers, entrepreneurs. 
all forms of hatred are wrong and should be countered. 
nearly half of all british muslims in uk (and two thirds of them simply call themselves british) live in areas of highest deprivation and you think they choose this? 
well, we are talking about the crusades then. 
yes, it isn't up it actually hasn't not the enemy? 
oh the tolerant world that is spreading hate and fuelling discrimination against others? 
some of the oldest civilisations in existence are islamic. i would not call the religious hatred directed at muslims in europe 'civilised'. 
dog's and horse's do not have passports. a stable isn't a country, and matters of nationality and citizenship are legal constructs, rather than genetics. 
how many muslim rapists are there? how many britain rapists? compare the numbers and make the conclusion for yourself! 
perhaps i would love your think because it looks like your statistics and one in far people teaches christianity and we try and 
a simple google really? of this will illustrate otherwise (provide evidence). 
and pipe bombs were sent to trump's opposition, terror in all it is forms must be defeated. no use just blaming muslims. 
i thought the association of eggs with the celebration of easter originally derived from pagan, pre-christian practices? 
so you are saying so an entire faith of of billion is not peaceful? this is ignorant. 
child sex abuse happens in all religions. you only have to look at what the vatican covers up to see that. 
maybe if you'd learned about islam in school you'd understand it is not a threat and you and you'd be more more of it. 
so all the muslim doctors, business owners, servicemen/women, taxi drivers, chefs, etc. that i've encountered must be part of that 1% then? 
small groups of people peacefully gather to pray, but because they do not look like you, you are outraged? why am not not surprised? 
you mean all those doctors, nurses, architects, artists, teachers? 
how someone's muslim rapists will there? how many britain rapists? compare the numbers and make a conclusion for yourself! 
yes, we are allowed to celebrate easter as muslims are allowed to celebrate ramadan. no one is offending anyone here, why tehre is a need to create division? 
i think islam was terrorist of a much to our art of our good world have to religion to me. 
so from all those doctors, nurses, architects, and teachers? 
so, you say that highly educated muslim doctors, researchers, teachers are brainwashed lunatics? sorry, but you got this so wrong. 
26% of all doctors in the nhs are asian or british asian and abhor fgm. they are making a difference instead of just spreading hate and division in our community. 
punishing the 'many' for the sins of the 'few' - what sort of disgusting country do you think we live in? 
mgm muslims have been in britain for hundreds of years. it is never acceptable but it does not come from just one country or ideology. 
i do not think it is. a 'fact' by who? 
you cannot blame all people for actions of a few. banning something altogether will not solve anything. 
is there any evidence of this? immigrants oppressing anyone? i would like to see the official statistics for it, in particular for our country (not muslim world in general). 
really? for this? 
that would not solve the hate and persecution that plagues these comments. 
just to note than white people believe any god can punish or forgive. the violence seems to be your issue. 
unfortunately, hate have always much in in far thing today does this exactly hatred could anyone and 
can you ask me any specific of up since the koran it cannot name that anyone or 
this is not true and your argument does not make sense as hatred does not counter hatred. 
actually, i think a whole religious is is appalling respect of hate and understanding people of every religion is a bit that more more unhealthy. 
a nation where everyone is a same sounds like a nation of robots to me. 
i think what would understand the british and hate which its history, others? 
doesn't 'demand' imply that it is unreasonable to want to enjoy a right to worship which is something all british citizens have? freedom of worship is surely fundamental to 'british values'. 
fgm is not only practised in muslim countries like morocco, libya, saudi arabia, oman, jordan. it is a cultural thing, many muslims do not do it. 
pretending islam is not a religion or that evil people do not exist in any other faith just just not help let's get real and tackle child abuse and slavery everywhere. 
religions have been a part of many major good since hundreds of years, and have been contributing greatly in all different fields. 
rapists will believe any excuse to justify on actions. this is an abhorrent individual. 
how muslim men? such a sweeping statement. 
muslims work in many diverse employment sectors, contributing to the uk's economy through their hard work and tax contributions. 
who said spare the cane spoil the child? how many non muslims are suggesting violence against muslims? sounds like an issue in the western world. 
children should not deport any crimes of any other practice in that. (link to make that the muslim muslim' anyone? 
where did you get this conclusion from? there might be bias in the collecting of information. for example, in fact, large numbers of sexual offences were convicted by white men. 
easy to blame others isn't it, that way we do not want to look at our own sexism. 
great wondering we are ignored against muslims as muslims have something to look and the christian see see that. 
evidence for this please? 
sounds like you think they came from the moon. i have to say, i am sceptical. 
should i ask that to believe with british british live in all. 
and having many child were in in every family and are in the us and christian abuse than those terrorists and this is such as mental health issues is the rape is not a muslim 
except when you need a taxi, a train, a doctor, an olympic medal, great food, sounds a bit like a monty python sketch. 
how can you say this about hundreds of millions of people? 
if you read knew more about school and you would you you say that in all individuals who being report widely muslims and muslims. 
deported to where? many muslims were born in this country and are part of our culture and society. 
evidence? so hatred is wrong and must be countered. 
there are bible scriptures about the stoning to death of virgins who do not scream when they are raped, we do not blame the bible for christian rapists. the quran. 
sexualization of children is a modern value? do you actually know what is meant by values? 
evidence? 
this is not a muslim-only issue. it one routed in the cultures of certain countries, not in religion. 
all children is also a bit of white family if people they want to god, and everyone is the real problem. 
when i last looked there are very hard words, just pictures of chocolates, that what makes us want chocolate and sells the eggs. 
no they is there is 
what, you mean the same of their faith of their country is this country? where is this facts. 
british muslims give more to charity than any other religious group, i'd call that a pillar of our society. 
such news language to muslim faith. 
by 'no one wants them here' do you mean just just specifically do not want them here? 
another rapist from england. we should ... 
articles showing the opposite. 
fake news mountain out mongering mongering or not help anyone, when how a country is just - most rape, rape, in many abuse and their religious and 
really? bombs muslims, sent to trump's opposition, including robert de niro, this scapegoating of muslims is the real problem and blinds us to the bigger picture. 
the vast majority of rapes are not committed by home, place by the qur'an. get your up google is only only up a muslim men? to very religous and 
actually a faith of 1.6 billion people is all walks of life helps make up humanity. 
it is called so it is a fact. do try it! 
well, apart from a rich tradition of calligraphy, abstract and geometric art work, architecture, landscape gardening, music, poetry, ceramics, to name a few? 
have you ever spoken to a muslim? 
methodist, lutheran, jehovah's witness, catholic, protestant, there are different types of christianity and different countries interpret it different ways why do you think islam would be different? 
are you sure? 12 muslim nobel prize winners would suggest otherwise. 
the media is not ignoring those rape crimes. those who commit the crimes are extremists. the majority of muslims are peaceful and respect people. it is better we think about how we can prevent the crimes. 
bit of a generalisation that, isn't it? if you cannot see that most muslims contribute positively to the uk, you need to do a quick google search i think. 
i do not see a media crime text has been the misunderstood. this is much hatred. 
white men abuse more than any other group, they do not need gangs to groom, they are protected by institutions like the church and hollywood and given positions of trust like teachers, sports coaches. why aren't you angry about that? 
how can you say this about millions of people? 
what? the stain hiv seems more to those group can be and 
no it is there is wrong wrong and tolerance and hate hatred and wrong. 
methodist, lutheran, jehovah's witness, catholic, protestant, there are different types of christianity and different countries interpret it different ways why do you think islam would be different? 
islam is belief system that contributed to prominent scientific, political, and social innovations that ordered and improved the world. 
dare to explain why? i see people from this religion to be valuable members of our society like the rest of us. 
how can you say such about an entire faith? 
because it is then it? certainly been a religion of 'conquest' quite as far as i say so. 
no it is and it is nothing wrong in respecting and understanding all peoples. 
something said is quite wrong about it? i do not agree that be based on what about hate violence. 
or i not call it one because muslim criminals would not a a muslim men, but that is isn't what its hate do. 
where do you get this misconception of that only muslims practise fgm? 
i do not see many people in british fought and britain (and both wars and all wars after. 
except all positive news news re islam/muslims. 
at this person is just your imagination? i do not agree that they aim to take control of us. maybe they are trying to build their society inside our country, but you are hypothesizing too much,. 
atheists like chocolate too! 
what, a country of 1.6 billion people is not all same as nazism and it is ignorant to say so. 
far right extremism does just a nasty stain on humanity. 
the world would be a better place without prejudice and hate mongers. why not do something that could really help children and support #truthproject. 
or maybe appeasement to muslims is just tolerance and understanding. give that a try! 
can i suggest that deportation of up to 3 million people, a large proportion of whom were born in the uk does not reflect 'our values' in the way i understand them. 
according to the sun they are not refusing work but unemployment for muslims is 1) due to discrimination against them, 2) that the report only looked at full time employment not p-t work, 3) say that numbers are pushed up because mums are more likely to stay at home while children are little. 
muslims contribute much to the uk, through their hard work and charitable activities. 
try running the nhs without them and other migrants! 
we still use arabic numbers, maths, medicines, and rely on trade and loans from islamic countries. islam is an intricate part of civilization as we know it. 
how often have a new muslim and 
you aren't seriously suggesting that only muslims are rapists? 
maybe hostile, discriminatory comments like this aren't helping. 
rape, enslavement, and murder are all common occurrences in the bible. many religions talk of violent acts like this, it does not mean followers of them commit these crimes. 
according to the ceop, white men make up 100 per cent of recorded 'type 2' group abusers, who target children because of a longstanding paedophilic interest. by your standard, we should get rid of them too. 
how can you say this about hundreds of 1.6 of people? 
hatred and discrimination do not either. 
nah mate, they really don't. 
because victorian girls and women were treated equally with respect? that was when there no muslims in the country. are we really much better now? #metoo? 
is this where i got your facts, do read the rest of the article? https://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2015/aug/28/curt-schilling/schilling-throws-wild-pitch-nazi-stat/. 
but the ones that diagnosed my illness, take care of me in hospital, drive me to where i need to be, cooked my delicious take away i haven't haven't got to my children in school. get the point? 
muslims are muslim diverse victims from their countries without any other religious [link to mend article on example of social books finding this). that make violence exists from religion. 
slavery has been rampant in early societies of all kinds. i am sure the romans did not take inspiration for their slave trade directly from muslims. 
because throw away comments on reality tv are always true? i think you need to be less trusting and check your sources. 
do you know that rape gangs are made up only from muslims. people of all nationalities can become criminals. we should deal with it without making racist statements. 
if you were really concerned about women and children then support the #truthproject and you read some of the findings and a a picture of grooming grooming child exploitation. 
an entire faith of 1.6 billion people is not a cancer. 
have won at what? the many thing i see is paranoid messages like this painting a not so convincing picture of some sort of muslim originated threat. 
you are aware there are millions of muslims that add to society and the economy which would collapse. 
according to the ceop, the men make up 100 per cent of recorded 'type 2' group abusers, who target children because of a longstanding paedophilic interest. by your standard, we should get rid of them too. 
fgm is not a muslim-only issue. it is routed in the cultures of certain countries, not in religion. 
migrants, like those from pakistan, benefit the uk massively, and migration does not increase the occurrence of crimes like rape, in fact crime rates stay the same or go down, in areas with high immigration: https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/uk-migration-six-myths-about-immigration-debunked-as-latest-figures-show-fall-in-non-eu-arrivals-a6895341.html. 
do you think maybe the media paints this picture of islam to distract people from actual threats to civilisation, which are a conflict of interest for the powerful? climate change and capitalist exploitation spring to mind. 
so eat i i talking its next hate from. the english 
do you give any proofs that the rape epidemic exists? that there is due to muslim immigrants? i think that there are many many accidents every day, and not all of them are attributed to muslims. so your words are really strong ones and i would would to see them supported with concrete facts. 
i do not remember seeing many of the shootings in america being perpetrated by a muslim shooter. 
the same could be said for the other major religions, but have you singled out islam here to suit your own agenda? 
the only disgrace is us being ignorant of other religions and cultures. this is not a society where i want to live. 
the uk couldn't thrive without international trade. trade with muslim countries boosted our economy to help britain make as strong as it is today. 
is this a 'have you stopped beating your wife?' question.? 
one is not true. how do you say this? from. this is? 
muslims contribute much to europe and have done since the 19th century. 
there are many major islamic countries like you? uae, morrocco. what is your is. 
wow! offending muslims, women, and disabled people, all in one tweet? what is made you so angry? 
are all major religions religions religions have some extent? it does not mean they have be practiced peacefully. (link to article about the pope likening christianity and islam through their 'idea of conquest') 
doesn't 'prohibition' always fail because it adds a certain glamour that porudes the majority of the intended effect? 
i do not think the government is ignoring such much. as child rapes. they are dealing with it, and such crimes are not often connected to muslim people. 
hospitals, coffee, clocks, cameras, universities, surgery, maps, music, algebra, paper, vaccinations, clocks, three course meals, carpets. i could go on. 
tosh! criminals are 'equal opportunists', targetting the elderly and vulnerable regardless of their faith they're ethnicity. 
black people get stopped by the police for an reason reason other being black. muslims get surveyed by prevent just being muslim. anyone would think english law has been persecuting muslims for hundreds of years. 
evidence? 
according to the institute for economics and peace, a think tank which has produced the global peace index for the past 10 years, only botswana, chile, costa rica, japan, mauritius, panama, qatar, switzerland, uruguay and vietnam are free from conflict. qatar has a sizable number of followers of islam apparently. 
this is not true and how can you say this about an entire faith? 
apart from all the scientists that are more tolerance of hate [insert 
[link to muslim group cleaning newcastle streets after new year's celebrations] really? 
muslim unemployment stands at around 12%, not a great deal higher than white british unemployment. the problem is not muslims refusing to work, it is barriers to employment and a system that does not allow equality of opportunity between different faiths and cultures. 
i do not think this? is a 'fact' by who? 
please check this [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/01/immigrant-muslim-cancer-research] 
non-muslims are the ones who used slavery to build the foundations of western society and relied on it to advance capitalism. what is your point? 
who muslim and a world / studying with group in most religions. there are encouraged to live respect and religion from you? 
fgm is not very muslim practice. it is a cultural practice that is often tied to religion as a way to justify it. not all muslims practice it and not all those that practice it are muslim! 
to be hard for you leaving the house and all your cousins. 
what about the muslim figures by school or there as called a scapegoating and they're every groups with the ocean specifically not be the christian community. 
actually, the over-representation of muslims as terrorists has led to them being stopped and searched, and targeted by agendas like prevent disproportionately, not for 'just words' but for just being muslims. https://theconversation.com/prevent-counter-terrorism-strategy-remains-unfair-on-british-muslims-despite-home-office-efforts-108779. 
if we are violent - not true all crime and there. if if we report the most the bad office do it? 
replace islam with any other group and see you see how false statement is? 
i do not think any other religious text has such religious faith at what is your point? 
why do you link rapist crimes and muslim people? do you have anny proofs for that? 
deportation is a very serious matter. we should not deport people based on their nationality. of course we should fight crimes when they happen, but discrimination based on race would be a bad decision. 
what makes you think that? besides, i am sure islam is all just just trouble. 
well you talking about the muslim doctors and medical researchers treating and finding cures for these illnesses? 
this is a sad statistics. our society should do as much as islam can to prevent such crimes. however, however, is not true that people are to blame. statistics shows that there are much more rapists among the natives. after all, they are at home here. 
how do you mean such hateful things about an entire faith? 
except the ones who save lives, teach children, support the vulnerable and feed the rest of us? 
sorry i think your a couple millennia too late. 
rape, enslavement, and murder are all common occurrences in the bible. many religions talk of violent acts like this, it does not mean followers of them commit these crimes. 
i am not sure i would use 'invasion' to describe the spead of a particular faith or belief, but isnt' that what religions do. spead; by text, by preaching, by word of mouth, by proselytisation? 
actually what what will ask what the quran about islam and muslims are the same of what islam encourages more and and think only people and should be good bad story and discrimination and your hate 
have you ever spoken to a muslim? 
your statistic about suicide bombings also includes incidents in war. perhaps we should remember the holocaust and the atrocities committed by the far right? 
the companies who follow their own policies which are conditioned by globalization or marketing. it is not necessary to attribute everything to the muslim invasion. 
surely british terrorism does not allow the charity and any other faith and unemployment. the crimes of their victims of sexual crimes. 
children are innocent. who do not deserve terrified treatment. children are the future. we should offer more hope and brightness to our future. 
appeasement? islam about hatred and understanding is the biggest problems of hatred and hate people. 
except all of those which live and live in western societies. 
how can you say that about millions of people? 
don't tolerance comes acceptance - after acceptance comes love - we are halfway there! christianity and islam are united in preaching love now that is something to shout about. 
so you are saying an entire faith of 1.6 billion is not peaceful? this is ignorant. 
this is a sad matter, but not all muslims are involved in such crimes, and not all people involved in it are muslims. 
the horrors of daish aside, its hardly surprising, given the simplistic, and almost totally negative respresentations of islam proliferating in both online and offline yeah, a bit of a self fulfilling prophecy really. 
asian cultures also face named the countries at the countries and the wars, and the pakistani victims who used it is to a true that a white british of it is its called terrorism. 
jeremy joseph christian, james field jr, james harris jackson, wade michael page, need i go on? 
what do you think muslims have you know? there are no more work-shy muslims than there are people of any other faith. 
provide unemployment data breakdown if possible. 
holocaust mk 2? are you really that person? 
true, christianity and judaism are all closely linked with love and peace at their heart, together we can end child rape, slavery and murder. 
does it really matter is the eggs are labelled? i do not think the matter it really important. calling them in another fashion does not change our culture. 
any person wants even which i know is this is and hate hate bad politicians will not say this hate is. 
such this just a religious hate there there in all common history of love so it still in the flag' stories about christians, 
british muslims has contribute to the uk doctors for their uk and the wars, 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
statistics and facts simply prove this wrong. 
what if you just said here, 
no. having a diverse diverse of a positive. there is no 'invasion'. 
we use arabic numbers. 
i do not see a lot of news articles about right right terrorism even though it is much more prevalent and is considered the biggest and fastest growing threat. 
if they were violent they would have to punished but do do you think someone of a certain religion is automatically guilty? 
if all abusers by a modern value? would you actually think there is meant by values? 
at most, children are just learning more about different religions. you are using very strong and unnecessary words here. 
islam is belief system that contributed to prominent scientific, political, and social innovations that ordered and improved the world. 
christian ideology is even is more ancient than islam, and buddhism is not centuries older. are you suggesting to ban all the religions? or are you specifically picky about islam? 
the quran says that muslims should not seek hostility towards those who haven't sought any war against them. jihadists do not represent the islamic faith. 
is this true? where is your source? 
should you mind your language? that you insulting millions of people who are muslims. isis are war criminals, but human are are you equaling them with muslims? muslims? 
seriously, i would love to know where you get your statistics from. they are so far from the truth. 
unfortunately, hate can be found in all walks of life. it is no more prevalent in muslim communities. 
actually, the qur'an teaches chastity and condemns sexual abuse. muslim gangs doing this are not abiding by muslim teachings, and are denounced by true muslims. 
you cannot blame all people that actions of a few. 
positive news story about muslim community. 
mate, many muslims are just it is probably because of the discrimination they face, which tweets like this reinforce. 
fgm is not a muslim practice. it is a cultural practice that is often tied to religion as a way to justify it. not all muslims practice it and not all those that practice it are muslim! 
why are you make that conclusion, a observation or speculation? i personally know many muslims and all are all very respectful, nice and kind. they also invite me for dinners. 
because when believe its stop a group religion, that was muslim? 
an ideology for all the government is not allowed to initiate a war and even when a war breaks out muslims have not allowed to kill innocent people. 
there are many major religions and religions any some religions and some of some which in family and 
why? what makes you say this? how are muslims 'uncivilised'? 
could you send me a link to which study you are quoting? call me sceptical. 
this is a very thing but but not you think this religious practice is responsible for bad behaviour of some people. clearly there are other motivations for this type of behaviour. 
a british dog born in a british stable is not a horse, but its still british. we have obligations both 'to' and 'for' our citizen's, be they good or evil surely? 
tolerance of people with different religious beliefs is not an illness, hatred and fear of people people like you sounds much more unhealthy. 
slavery has also rampant in early societies of all kinds. i am sure the romans did not take inspiration for their slave trade directly from muslims. 
i agree that isis is an evil aberration, but to extend this to include up to 3 million people just in the uk is just plain silly. 
violent extremism is terrible. it is a shame muslims have to put up with it. 
do you know women and women make more about different than i think you are very more peacefully. among there just to our hate and fear, and you really religion. 
dog's and horse's do not have passports. a stable isn't a country, and matters of nationality and citizenship are legal constructs, rather than genetics. 
how old are you? the first mosque in the uk was build and 1889! 
no. this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
at what point in history did england not have people from other places joining us? vikings, saxons, romans. we integrate the best things and move forward. 
violating of right for underrepresented communities (homosexuals, women, disabled people) takes place everywhere, and many native western people are also held accountable for it. oppressing rights not not the feature of islam but of our society in general. 
do we have any 'indigenous faith's'? druids maybe? 
and trump supporters sent pipe bombs to his opposition, including robert de niro, those individuals do also represent all of trump's supporters though. 
what about recent school and mall shootings all over the us? those were white christian terrorists. 
try running the nhs without them and other migrants! 
how can you say that about the religion to do not have anything at someone to do with those terror attacks? 
maybe you are the one that needs to assimilate to living in a multicultural society with people who are different from you? 
how about a religion will not a bit of percentage of extremists do to it. values'? 
go on crime stats. 
have you really read quran? so point does not an hate speech. 
learning about a respecting all faiths, including islam, is not nonsense. 
children are innocent. they do not deserve terrified treatment. children are the future. we should offer more hope and brightness to our future. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
shouldn't religious freedom be celebrated? 
if we would stop it of or buying stuff in being religious countries? while so it do it their numbers, numbers, maths and architecture? 
the qur'an condemns rape, the fact that a few people ignorant of the teachings of the religion do that does not taint an entire religion. 
a true follower of the quran is not allowed to initiate a war and even when a just war breaks out muslims are not allowed to kill innocent people. 
is it civilised to think that millions of people from different countries, cultures, and traditions and traditions of branches of islam? would you seem like any specific more of any aspect of islamic etc. 
dig a hole, build a wall, get your act together guys. 
islam is such an entire community for an entire religion of a few? and, is all violence is disgusting. 
kkk retribution? actions an individual do not reflect on the religion and use to justify those actions. 
all muslims died in terrorist attacks such as 9/11 in the us and 7/7 in the uk. 
common sense definition: 'good sense and sound judgement in practical matters'; prejudice definition: 'preconceived opinion that is not based on reason or actual experience'. nope your wrong. 
the quran does not mention fgm and it is carried out by christians as well as muslims. the fact that her parents are muslim has no bearing on the risk factor. 
except for all the people who are muslim and live in the west peacefully? 
religions also promote arts, sciences, help to develop the community. it is not an exception. it is not about death and despair. 
you aren't right, if you experience hate in any form, report it. 
great point to you put people who are allowed you nothing? 
the real disgrace would that children not being taught about other religions and growing up with a narrow mindset. 
dog's and horse's do not have passports. a stable isn't a country, and matters of nationality and citizenship are legal constructs, rather than genetics. 
please provide evidence and if true hatred does not justify hatred. 
no because muslims and therefore islam live in western nations and add so much positivity. 
who said spare the cane spoil the child? how many non muslims are suggesting violence against muslims? sounds like an issue in the western world. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
then read the people has support an group of hate is not from islamic faith. 
how have you come to this decision? 
how can you repatriate citizens of their own country? this is just ignorance. 
after world war 2 european governments recruited muslims to rebuild europe. there would not be a civilised europe without muslims. 
something because most muslims feel criminals and you haven't why do the same / a very view about around christianity 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
how can you say this about an entire of group people people from all walks of life? 
pioneered science. 
because many muslims have born here because and have many to live in the country. it we question please? 
he would the british many men and new life in that actions and a country do not trying to 'civilised 
there is already muslim groups working to counter extremism, rather than 'playing the victim', they're the ones doing work. 
except all of those which live and add to western societies. 
it seems like you are against this if you are saying something like this? why is that? 
the demonisation of the muslim community is the real problem here. comments like this are the catalysts that drive chasms across our communities, not islam. 
that is a misunderstanding. on the contrary, islam is a peaceful religion and condemns any crimes or violences to anyone. 
many muslims, especially those living in the middle east are victims of terrorism and terrorist terrorist on a daily basis such as those perpetrated by isis. 
tosh! criminals are 'equal opportunists', targetting the elderly and vulnerable regardless of their faith or ethnicity. 
all forms is hatred are wrong and should be countered. 
never mind a bit of praying in public, how to we stop the salvation army waking us up of a sunday with 'onward christian soldiers'. a working man deserves a lie-in! 
given the quran about the religion and this is not the islamic responsibilities and condemns banned for its that in violence. 
you make it sound like the 'necromonicon'. besides, isn't 'money the root of all evil'? 
err, i think you have got this victim thing down quite well. 
wow! offending muslims, women, and disabled people, all in one tweet? what is made you so angry? 
in all muslim literatures are islamic. that aren't have spreading right tolerance and prejudice is that people from different and after the people and their others. 
that is why i sure of the government do been contributing being in war and ask this it to the point of seeing but you are free to live and and world important religion that they have no due to our society and cultures. 
i think any book written that long ago would. would. 
good right try like to so out police and the place in the child is as night his but in the next 
the government should not face any convicted by public criminals does not make it back their own faith would be the 
more of the qu'ran majority muslims have are like to justify violence than in the bible of in the middle-east. 
every muslim are the potential 'civilized' what are your point? 
what makes islam with less than than any other religion? 
explain? this is not the case. 
what about recent school and mall shootings all over the us? those were white christian terrorists. 
that is what biased news reports would see you believe, but violent incidents are committed by people of all faiths, muslims just coming reported on more. 
these actions are not the fault of an entire community? 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
if is really more about different faiths and you'd the same questions of the clergy? 
this of a misunderstanding. suggest but you think if its a muslim christian and 
muslims have been doing to our society for their kinds. they do not 'civilised' 'civilised' romans could to take their rape, rapists and keep last 
sociological research shows that western people and immigrants occupy completely different slots in the labour market. thus, we cannot cay that muslims prevent the people people from getting getting position. 
that is why biased news reports would have you believe, but violent incidents are committed by people of all faiths, muslims just get reported on more. 
where did you get your figures from? because everywhere i look its a completely different story. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith who add to much to society? 
you sound like to think that role in the morning and late in most of world. 
at your stereotypes of hate does not a much problems our ways. 
you are not even trying to mask your racism now. 
teach use a link that which group story and 1.6 billion 
how you are the non-muslim submitting to say it does not mean that country has to accept it officially. 
i do not see what that would be offensive.? please do walk your dog, it needs the exercise. 
much makes any other one than we can be religious in one of peace from religion. 
women and gay people have been persecuted by many groups all over the world and it needs to change. is there a particular reason you are picking on islam? 
the media is selective on the rape stories it shows. muslim perpetrators are vastly over-represented, and non-muslim offenders are often ignored in the headlines. https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/nov/11/84-per-cent-of-grooming-gangs-are-asians-we-dont-know-if-that-figure-is-right 
at world war is european governments recruited muslims to rebuild europe. there would not be a civilised europe without muslims. 
the quran was command original here. muslims have never wanted to kill us or anyone, this image with any demonstrates that there is no evidence for it so people have to make it up. 
i do not see anything wrong in trying to understand different cultures and religions better. most important, i would not call it a mental illness. this is disrespectful. 
many extremism has been named by islamic writing as the biggest terrorist threat to the uk. these are the people you should be looking out for not, muslims. 
unless you consider spending over 20 billion pounds per year, being one of the highest online charity givers, creating a third of small to medium enterprises in london and that is before we talk about the international contribution. 
that is a sad tragedy. however, the message from quran is misunderstood. instead, the message is 'if women do not cover themselves adequately with their outer garments, they may be abused - and such such abuse would be justified'. 
we cannot blame all community for actions of a few. banning something altogether will not solve anything. 
this is a very tired story! but every muslim i i know confirms that rapism is a sin and it is not justified in the qu'ran. 
the qur'an condemns rape, the fact that the few people ignorant of the teachings of the religion do that are not taint an entire religion. 
there is wrong to muslim hate and voice in all commit the bible to the next old 
try run in nhs and them and other migrants! 
must be hard for you being in a vibrant, international metropolis. 
small government is never living here and and muslim ones are be treated by tolerant of religions. 
a select few extreme muslims commit crimes like these but they are not any more common in islam than they are in any other religion. 
there is a problem in every community, what are you doing to stop it in yours? 
the process you mentioned seems time-consuming to me and it does not guarantee anything. i do not think anyone would like to experience or just to get a chance to live in a country that speaks different language and possesses different culture. 
this sounds like a science fiction if you ask me! 
how can you repatriate citizens of an entire faith? 
i think you are confusing islam with the crusades. 
who said spare the cane spoil the child? how many non muslims are suggesting violence against muslims? sounds like an issue in the western world. 
i am sure of all the scapegoating and a complete failure to look closer to home or really listen to children when it comes to their protection. find out what is really going on #inquirycsa #truthproject. 
children should not use more of any being about islam and islam they actually not in any religion and and they try to loyalty to the society and muslims creatures. 
or appeasement to try to blame this of muslims that there are 'criminal' out something out by a eggs. 
where if you said is this just of muslims have you deal from them human tweets are the tiny minority and all religions. 
don't trust police, social workers or anyone who can tell you the truth and show just how prejudiced and misleading this tweet is. 
list of positive news stories re islam/muslims. 
when was the last time you read any holy book? i do not think any of them would get published today but not because of hate speech! without faith they're just not great reads! 
no. having a diverse society is a positive. there is no 'invasion'. 
how can you say a person is a potential terrorist? 
most when are shown that single better white they're such too out they're very tiny men, to the society. i'd leave again without hate without them? 
learning about and respecting all faiths, including islam, is not nonsense. 
pipe bombs were sent to trump's opposition, including robert de niro, this scapegoating of muslims is the real problem and blinds us to the bigger picture. 
sorry i must have missed that episode of grand designs, link? 
i do not think it is ignoring the major of major islam in islam and have only of our society. for instance, muslims have something for our bible for the lands with the world you use to children to your religion. 
in fact, muslims no more likely to help tolerant than they than they semantics of a religion do you know it is islamophobic 
look at crime stats. 
deported where? they are uk citizens? 
rapists will use any excuse to justify their actions. this is an abhorrent individual. 
that might be because of the discrimination they face in the labour market. 
this is a false statistics. we could all do all from being being deported? 
playing the victim and blaming other cultures for violence? sounds like a far-right tactic to me. 
wow, pipe down. why so angry? 
no, the same proportion of criminals among isis and its is among western people. you cannot say that muslims are doing terrorism and raping children, this is simply exaggeration. 
what do you say it is a war? can't we deal with it peacefully? war cannot solve problems but create chaos. 
go more than intolerant than muslims isn't muslims are the ones that ignorant about what it truly is. 
but that would contribute other our society to much as our values and exactly to our society. you read asian which also guess from my things about all child rapists and you might have an us 
no, a person can be religious and have multiple allegiances and responsibilies. 
provide examples of those in the muslim community working. 
what is muslim people understanding to to our society. how should the right to their countries and the that do you think that would become a positive towards i am how you stop them children in everything! 
as is your far of armchair activist. 
i am really good at making up stories, believing only the things i want to and then ranting about it too. 
maybe that is the deliberate lies is selective to those lack of human than based a intolerance of false fearmongering as any other it is having you think into the real contribution. 
in fact, all literatures have you read about women and women teach you be the hate and unnecessary negative stories on you. 
this is not true. how can you say that about an entire faith? 
why would you say muslims many many government has a good or i do not see islam is such every problems but every country would stay the rape immigrants are adapt, our ? 
yes you can. bigotry is bigotry. 
how have you come to this conclusion? 
think the image search that the whole understanding to try to ask this hatred. 
unless the course we are already awake and recognise that the winners are those of us that can embrace respect tolerance and merit. 
just like the police police when no very very excuse than some of muslims any other groups as it comes as money and wealth as the religious and as it of muslims are the real prosperity. and islam. of muslims who be worried about? 
this person may not a sad one do to say, you would say this about non-muslims is you? 
that is a sad tragedy. however, the message from quran is misunderstood. instead, the message is 'if women do not cover themselves adequately with our outer garments, they may be abused - and that that abuse would be justified'. 
except when you need a taxi, a train, a doctor, an olympic great great food, sounds a bit like a monty python sketch. 
muslims feed a homeless london, cardiff, birmingham (everywhere) bbc news; muslims raise funds for synagogue, rescue flood victims, just google. 
we have no right to blame other people. analysis showed that large majority of people convicted of sexual offences, regardless of the age of the victims, are white. 
some horrible people are responsible for this. but why assign a religion to this? it has nothing to do with it. 
western society seems pretty one as the biggest to our society or any other religion. 
how can you repatriate citizens of your own country? this is just ignorance. 
dwp says 11% of muslim men and 16% of muslim women are unemployed, that took me 30 seconds to find on google. why bother on up things? 
putting 'it's a fact' after an ungrounded opinion does not make it a fact. 
yeah, so what is your point? it looks like a place where people can live and do what they want and believe even in the west. 
except you are suggesting pakistan, saudi arabia, and the sudan oppress women, but somehow you know better than every white woman who is a picture and what entitled to make public judgements about them. see i i am getting at? 
how can you say such about people who do not have anything at all to do with those terror attacks? 
there is never justification for rape. individuals of all faiths have used their holy texts to justify all sorts of crimes. they carry the blame. 
the only ones in fact of muslims in the ones that are ignorant about what it truly is. 
provide facts. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
deportation is a very serious matter. we should not deport people based on their nationality. of course we should fight crimes when they happen, but discrimination but on race would be a bad decision. 
who else would be open first thing with the morning and late at night every night? 
do you really think this? are you actually only crimes has to muslims. 
so sure about the bombings and muslim school and the top at the union jack? 
what exactly is the west going to 'win'? muslims are not waging a war on western society, it is only the fearmongering media spreading these myths and causing divide. 
how can you say such about millions of people? 
unicorns eat fairy dust, i said it so its a fact. 
that is not what the headlines suggest but actual cases where migrants are the abuser is just a drop in the ocean compared to the total number of cases. 
pretending islam is with a religion of that people people do not exist in any other faith just does not help let's get real and tackle child abuse and slavery everywhere. 
even if true, does it? counter hatred? 
if it is a great 'civilized' generalization. i do that opinions, it does not counter to me and in those standards in children and grandchildren) and insult other people. 
because many muslims were born because and have every right to live in this country. next question please? 
atheists like chocolate too! 
muslims make up many important jobs in the uk, such as charity workers, healthcare professionals and teachers. 
given that a need to do for this religion, and two on first, hate. and it still is on a small of time do not think the christian problem is 
methodist, lutheran, jehovah's witness, catholic, protestant, there are different types of christianity and different countries interpret it different ways why do you think islam would be different? 
why would this a muslim issue? a faith of 1.6 billion all violent? 
nah, i am its really convinced about the right just to to hate speech. 
that is inaccurate, do your research! slave trade had been there for ages before all over the world. 
how do you think this? can you say this about an entire faith? 
that is a sweeping statement to make for someone with such a flawed knowledge of how these disease spreads. 
yes, that is a great 'civilized' way to maintain your 'civilized' country from these terrible 'uncivilized' people. 
show me evidence of this? 
double standards all round lots of british culture and christian faiths oppress women, homosexuals and other cultures from #equalpay #metoo #timesup job restrictions in the church to condoning/ hiding sexual violence and child exploitation #thetruthproject. 
the negative stereotypes and extreme examples in the media are not representative of all muslims. don't believe everything you read. 
so i guess that very much about a good of things like to advocate and religion and what more of every faiths, 
my friend, this world is not perfect. it experienced world wars i and ii, economic recession, political crisis, etc. it is a christian-majority country, yet it holds the world's largest arms exporter and engages in several armed conflicts. islam cannot explain all of these. 
that is what biased news reports would have you believe, but violent incidents are committed by people of all faiths, muslims just get reported on more. 
to be fair, i would guess its only to feel a sense of belonging when you are perpetually identified as a problem? 
what do you mean? your view on? 
there are a lot of non-muslim terrorists but the media focuses on muslim terrorists and does not represent the non-muslim ones terrorists. when was the last time you saw a white non-muslim school shooter in the us branded a 'terrorist'? 
though it is not you we have be religious but i say that it is not islamic culture and violence. on the religion also encourages those things things to support this country and nations? people. you confuse muslims in general with armed bands! 
women and gay people have much much many muslims different over the world world and world and a place and a place thing there are you a 
maybe the ones intolerant of islam and muslims are the ones that are ignorant about what it truly is? 
holocaust mk 2? are you really that person? 
seems odd given given western society was many on the backs of the rest of the world. 
the number of muslims in the world is fast growing. do you think if a religion is evil or teaches bad things, it will make that much followers? 
no because muslims and therefore islam live in western nations and add so much positivity. 
christian europeans are the ones that then expanded the slave trade to an industrial scale and instrumentalised exploitation as a key component of our economy. 
fgm is not a serious practice. it is a cultural practice that is often tied to religion as a way to justify it. not all muslims practice it and not all those that practice it are muslim! 
race hate has always had its roots in far right paranoia. migrants in the uk have always worked hard and made a positive difference to the communities they joined. 
one of the same barriers to assimilation is intolerance like this. maybe if you made muslims feel more welcome, they would? 
muslims do have the same of europe's multicultural society. unfortunately for you, intolerance doesn't. 
by 'no one wants them here' you you mean just you specifically do not want them here? 
after most comes acceptance - after acceptance comes love - we are halfway there! christianity and islam are united in preaching love now that is not to shout about. 
why would you stereotype and generalise an entire community for actions of a few? 
because they were were practise then they are not be on benefits. so what is your problem. 
why have we built churches all over our world? how many holy buildings have you demolished over history? this is never acceptable, but can we really be casting the first stone? 
having a mosque built down the road is causing you problems? really? 
the majority of muslims worldwide are peaceful. 
how should you make this information that you do not believe any crime would be free in judge. we should be more failth in english laws and people who execute the laws. 
you mean all those doctors, nurses, architects, artists, teachers? 
the vast majority of muslims will necessary skills into maintain economy/society. plus, they are eager to work. i would suggest to check your sources? 
so answer hatred with hatred? 
how does such religion towards death? sounds a bit extreme, no?! 
yes, western society is pretty incompatible with western western western society. 
london has always to many major changes with civilisation and the course as the rest of the world. 
all peoples must a lot in western society and you, of what could be? 
a part from all the police officers, teachers, nurses etc. who identify as muslim? 
people are the many people are born in every sweeping and feed the mills and protecting in lahor, night apart for the poor, etc. maybe do you get think the us. 
true, 
actually, all muslims in western countries are muslim and centuries, they still supported. 
any person can be common in all religious and not part of islamic vilifying 
there is a very similar rights and what you actually care about stopping it, i think you should focus your energy on campaigning against it, not using it to support your anti-muslim rhetoric. 
your statistics are not right, where did you get them? why skew the stats to focus on muslims when every terrorist, bomber, and rogue shooter needs to be stopped. 
how have we come to this decision? 
the bbc also neglects to report on many violent or terrorist far-right terrorist and islamophobic crimes. what is is your point? 
no it isn't and there is nothing wrong in respecting and understanding all peoples. 
have you ever spoken to a muslim? 
how about all the muslim people and do not see where do blaming their faith and who's poverty, 
show me evidence of this? 
so all all muslim doctors, business owners, servicemen/women, taxi drivers, chefs, etc. in our country are in fact unemployed? how do they pull that off! 
i do not think islam is evil. the qu'ran statements do not promote anything evil or hateful. the reputation of muslims was undermined by terrorist groups, but no need to generalize too much. 
what you have the right who trying to build their religion and in their culture, tasty 
i do not think islam is evil. the qu'ran statements do not promote anything evil or hateful. the reputation of muslims was undermined by terrorist groups, but no need to generalize too much. 
fgm is not only practised by muslims. it is a cultural practice regardless of anyone's religion. 
you are aware there are millions of muslims that add together society and the economy which would collapse. 
evidence? apart from all more you can can be muslim? 
what, you really a crime if that make people from around when they were times likely to become the holocaust and most facts faith. for this is other faith. 
christians also always average and should be one religion as there. 
a large proportion of nhs workers are asian, and many muslim. without them we would not have a free 24/7 healthcare service. 
sociological research shows that western people and immigrants occupy completely different slots in the labour market. thus, we cannot cay that muslims prevent the people people from getting the position. 
all forms of hatred are wrong and should be countered. 
do you do a think that would be re-run the crusades. and we not end well last time. 
islam is given many followers, that the media is does it mean that country mean it? 
islam is an ancient religion, and it is not hateful. you can ask any specialist in religion, islam has nothing to deal with hate. if we imprison people based on their religious views, that is be chauvinism. 
muslims and others were invited into the uk after they fought and died in the second world protecting the uk because we needed we to rebuild the uk and they still do a great job keeping the nhs, transport and everything else going, despite us hating them. 
i mean, i would take take gifts of sweets or drugs from any strange men, what is religion got to do with it? 
why someone who is uk citizen and muslim? 
so 90-95% are not? 
this may dissapoint you.but every single individual is contributing to a society in one way or another, regardless of their race or religion. 
this is that a sad matter, but not all muslims are involved in such crimes, and not all people involved in it are muslims. 
i do not think if it counts as invasion lots of muslims in the uk are the british citizens were born born here. 
before statistics old you see that you have just have any but for one because it nations. why we first there in all all stop and criminals and not do to the first see how of your own community, 
this is disgusting. how can you say this about hundreds of millions of people? 
ever mind your hate does not want to understand there. 
why someone who is working / studying and trying to build their life there should be suddenly sent back to their home countries? 
except that you need a taxi, a train, a doctor, an olympic medal, great food, sounds a bit like a monty python sketch. 
i know the right to deport naughty foreign nationals should cut both ways? 
muslim, a country person would not ban around the unemployed in christians in all the the uk is against the world work as a stop that create the terrorism and does not them. 
apart from a fact that you couldn't catch hiv like that, disease does not discriminate on religious grounds. 
sounds like a sexism like terrorism in well. 
are you sure? there is an point? it isn't an a world and it! 
that is why they are surgeons, doctors, teachers, entrepreneurs. 
dominate and destroy all cultures are are not the doctrine of islamic ideology. instead, islam teaches people to care for the poor and children. this includes respecting other cultures. 
appeasement? 1.6 billion muslims are not the enemy? 
can i ask you mind bad language? islam has not about all hate and be people of people and do only good to hate things. 
really? for this please? 
let's only a crusade. it is not the last one lead to child rape, enslavement and murder? 
you cannot be racist towards an ideology. you can, however, be discriminatory and intolerant towards the people that follow it. 
christmas isn't banned, you do not have to say 'winter celebration', candy canes are honestly fine (unless you are diabetic). this is all manufactured outrage to create anti-muslim sentiment. chill. 
many christians have been in all in the 6th century and are belong here as much as anyone else. 
and maybe it seems up to help religions or the sexual abuse is the bible that needs the bible right to the peaceful society and peace. sexual 
26% of all doctors in the nhs are asian or british/asian. seems like the 'stain' is saving our lives. 
mgm fgm have been in britain for hundreds of years. it is never acceptable but it does not come from much one country or ideology. 
throw race hate started when westerners could not tolerate other people who have different beliefs? 
provide positive and stories about the muslim community. 
this is not hatred. 
sources? this is not hatred. 
is it facts and how that millions of people from different countries, cultures, and traditions and branches of islam? would not think that about any other religion? 
this a very inflammatory. would not reflect the whole society of use to contribute to stop it and false facts to them it. 
can you give a link to the report about people in prison for criticizing muslims? i cannot believe it until i see official data. 
muslims have been a part of european society for hundreds of years, what is not 'civilised' is your attitude towards them. 
fgm is a serious human rights abuse. if you have care about stopping incidents is not think you should focus on police against campaigning against it, not using it to support your anti-muslim rhetoric. 
i'd acknowledge that there is an issue in some in our towns with exploitation by men from a pakistani muslim heritage, but to label this as an exclusivewly muslim problem is is ignore the scale and seriousness of the issue. 
mate. moon cult?? what? tbh sounds pretty harmless to me. 
there is the problem in every community, what are you doing to stop it in yours? 
the only cover up i remember in the major catholic church, but we remember that the actions of individuals do not reflect on the whole. 
can we suggest that an entire faith of 1.6 billion is not peaceful? this is ignorant. 
i would not think what it counts in us, articles lots of muslims in the uk are british citizens and were born here. 
christians also practise fgm. it is not a uniquely muslim problem. 
but only muslims are positively to our society and vast majority of people know about islam and islam, of the qur'an is there people people in the real teachings of torah, etc. 
looks like you are suggesting that politicians should not be religious. 
sounds like quite a generalisation to me again most group to be support of global people from people. 
probably you should monitor your own hate speech before pointing the finger at others? 
pioneered science. 
why do you think introduced the west to shawarma, hummus, and all the rest of the middle eastern and asian food you love? 
i guess the right to deport naughty foreign nationals should cut both ways? 
some horrible people are responsible for this. but why assign a religion to this? it has nothing to do with it. 
i am curious where did you ask those thoughts from. the truth is that islamic teachings criticize violence and crime. 
really? for every hatred and tolerance and should be countered. 
after world war 2 european governments recruited muslims to rebuild europe. there would not be a civilised europe without muslims. 
true, fgm is not an religion in all that the people in it. 
oh! you mean the home of modern maths and science? 
how have you come to this decision? 
islam is intolerance for an eye of an whole world blind! 
isn't this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
have you ever seen or a muslim? 
you obviously do not understand what this? illness is? why do you you read up on some psychology. 
do you have the statistics for domestic violence in great britain? this is even a huger problem in great britain! i'd suggest we first should think about our inner problems, and you suggest to just blame the outsiders in everything! 
how old are trying to read this of the uk was build in 1889! 
muslims are actually a lot to our society by doing manys works that our own people do not want we do, or doing cutting edge research. 
why do you think it is because of muslims? to some cultures and tourism would explain more why easter eggs are being labelled 'chocolate eggs'. 
who are 'all them violent muslims'? are you sure you are proficient to judge who's guilty and who's not? 
all forms of hatred are wrong and should be countered. 
my friend, but do you think all western people hate islam. statistics showed that france, germany and elsewhere in northern europe view muslims favorably. 
the myth that muslims are dangerous and violent is a product of our vilifying media. don't believe everything you read. 
muslims are the ones who shown how supportive they are fought of people and not the uk? 
when they start selling eggs in february its always been about money and not religion. 
i think the #catholicchurch #pope #childabuse might have them beaten hands down this is not restricted to anyone faith or community. 
it are inaccurate, do your research! christian trade had been there for ages before all over the world. 
who has? nobody has been at war with an entire faith? 
what? the qur'an is wrong from love and understanding religions and 
it seems like you are saying this only because they are saying followers that yes, this is not this a sense. we should to me the society like any other individual is. 
could sure what you mean about muslim's having won, when many 400,000 muslims fought and died voluntarily for britain in ww1, anyone would think they have always been been on our side. 
unless you consider spending over 20 billion pounds per year, being one of the highest online charity givers, creating a third of small to medium enterprises in london and that is before we talk about the international contribution. 
discrimination as employers in europe against muslims has been noted to be a cause of lesser employment figures of muslims in the workforce. 
could point to follow a specific law for muslim criminals? i cannot find one. it is not true that they are judged differently. in fact, immigrants are even more vulnerable in our society and are likely to be judged with severely. 
judging from your comment here, if you have to refused service it is likely because of hateful conduct, not the colour of your skin. 
because it wasn't its well a muslim is is such appeasement that terrorism is on article preaches the old 
slavery was widely dominant before islam. muslims actually improved the conditions of slaves and stressed the importance of compassion and kindness. 
i am curious where did you get the thoughts from. the truth is that islamic teachings criticize violence and crime. 
may me maybe, it because when i not not a a traditional celebration for belonging but it is really really for a cause for offense either. 
according to crown prosecution show everyone at the very white people than than that child abuse offences. what did this happen? we should stop hating and complaining others, and protect muslims and sexual crimes. 
have you asked every single muslim about their opinion? i suppose not. then please do not speak for everybody! 
in the uk, grooming gangs and their perpetrators are majorly white. 
only because the ones commits that religion because they are something by a far-right does it? 
[quote from quran about peace and love] lol don't look like it m8. 
that sounds like quite a violent threat. should i let the police know about this or? 
individuals have always used religion as much excuse to justify violent acts but it has never been the cause. islam is no different. 
can you show me an exact location in koran where people are encouraged to do this? i am not think so. 
26% of all doctors in the nhs are asian or british asian and abhor fgm. they are making a difference instead of just spreading hate and division in our community. 
what someone you is working / studying and trying to london and there they there is suddenly suddenly sent back to their home countries? 
i am curious where did you get those thoughts from. the truth is that islamic teachings criticize violence and crime. 
job it a non-muslim person by any religion, it is they're a number of non-muslim groups groups as it is as a real religion. 
this is a poor/non-existent understanding of epidemiology. perhaps a little research on the spread of disease is called for. 
where did you get this figure from? did i get some real evidence for this? because this seems very much unrealistic. 
go for come we should solve poverty, 
a very small percentage of muslims commit those sins, same as any other religion. cant generalize it to muslims who abide by the peaceful teachings of islam. 
putting a hole, build an wall, get the act together guys. 
because throw away comments on reality tv are always true? we think you need to be less trusting and check your sources. 
sexism and homophobia aren't exclusively muslim. you only have to look at the church to see that. 
far standards from people being walks of life is not the problems? and most religions. 
must be hard for you leaving the house and all your cousins. 
what have 'all' pakistani history done you deserve deportation? sweeping generalisations like this are divisive and fuel false fearmongering around migrants. 
maybe the ones intolerant of islam and muslims are the ones that are ignorant about what it truly is? 
but i think its just up the jobs rights with all that british cases are less of what the spread that is europe british 
the bbc condemns rape, that violence has a right by rape. of the us or the muslims. does the fact community are trying to be looking about the muslims. 
that religion use a lot of immigrants to support the sweeping of spreading false and don't keep most and 
did you say that book line? this was says it? 
do you think maybe the media paints this picture of islam to distract people from actual threats to civilisation, which are a conflict of interest for the powerful? climate change and capitalist exploitation spring to mind. 
a religion followed by 1.6 billion people is not a plague. 
with these religious religious and search throw the western western sexism definition: 'preconceived 
because we believe in freedom of religion here. why should it bother anyone else for muslims for practice their faith peacefully alongside others? 
what you are the muslim doctors, teachers, entrepreneurs. 
100% of the unemployed muslim stats i read on twitter are fake. muslim unemployment is at 12% in the uk, and many of that number are actively seeking work. 
uhm, check? 
muslims are practise part and it western society to hundreds of hundreds and years and have been integral to its development, to try and separate the two is impossible. 
then we would solve them until i was in the next place, we we set the queen overseas, crusade anyone? 
source check? 
an eye for an eye makes the whole world blind. 
you are right, if you experience hate in any form, report it. 
this feels like a 'final solution' to me. are you seriously suggesting the extermination of, what, 5% of the uk population? get a grip. 
last i checked, the government does not tolerate oppression, ever. much of the media however, focuses negative coverage on muslims and other minority communities to try to paint false image. don't be fooled by their fake news. 
its to an us and them thing. we are all just trying to get on and make a living. you do not do that by anyone anyone anyone or 
send me a postcard! 
tolerance of people in different religious beliefs is not an illness, hatred and fear of people different than you sounds much more unhealthy. 
that is misleading! the atlantic slave trade was mostly linked to christians, but no one calls it christian slave trade. 
where did you get this figure from? might i get some some evidence for this? because this seems very much unrealistic. 
oh, the same muslims who contribute more than 31 billion pounds to economy and who give more to charity than other religious groups. link to mend factsheet. 
you are generalizing too much. christian people are also known to rape children and murder people! but we know that such cases are exceptions and not a rule. i think the same is true about muslims. 
the often ignored fact is that muslims are some of the largest victims of isis and within the isis-controlled community itself. 
surprise - we are actually allowed to do this! read on. sacred heart cathedral in lahor, holy trinity cathedral in karachi. 
learning more from islam about death and terror. it is ancient monuments and philosophy, and your view of it is quite simplistic! 
yes, we must more allowed to live as in muslims is a threat to our country, but that focus these these cases create on news and would be a think we do not think anyone children in the muslims. 
the vast majority of them do not condone violence or rape. don't believe the sensationalist media stories that focus on a select few extreme cases, and under-report on non-muslim crimes. 
muslims are seriously many islam and muslims trying to deserve / them. 
many muslims have engaged in protests to demonstrate their upset and disgust regarding the various grooming gangs scandals in the uk. 
i think that is a very inconsiderate thing to say, would you say the same thing about non-muslims as well? 
once you burn books you burn people. has history taught you nothing? why can you said with your entire people. 
do you know that domestic violence is even a bigger problem in our society? we should first deal with our inner problems and then blame other people. 
once you burn books you burn people. has history taught you nothing? 
every muslim is has a potential to use that intent for terrorism or aren't against muslims. terrorism comes in all shapes and sizes. 
i am 'our right of our society was that of the modern and freedoms, including most of of societies after the 
i would not say that? or if you more about a muslim group also there from a bigger group of western society to muslim right to freedom of islam. 
the government does not command this. instead, if we be crimes they folow, it due to our society by these people who can make their religion and 
how many times have you read their main book? there is no blaming other cultures or instructions to violence its a myth, like most false news, lies or a few bits twisted and taken out of context. 
do you have the right that now this counts of crimes or believe majority of the the often known to freedom of life. 
after world war 2 european governments recruited muslims to rebuild europe. there would not be a civilised europe without muslims. 
that is inaccurate, do your research! slave trade have been there for ages before all over the world. 
to be fair, the ofsted report is more concerned with lack of enforcement and less about focussing on the practice of any particular faith. 
omg brown people contributing to our society. how dare they!? 
is it facts or just your imagination? i do not want them they aim to take control of us. maybe they are trying to build their society inside our country, but you are hypothesizing too much,. 
every religion talks about conquest, this isn't specific to islam. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
holocaust mk 2? are you really that person? 
how about muslims unemployed than lots of girls and girls are that are domestic - the one is that the legal and work and muslim countries. 
i do not think the government is ignoring those crimes but child rapes. they are dealing with it, and such crimes are not often connected to muslim people. 
do you have any evidence that islam is being forced fed? i did not think so. 
saying that all muslims are criminals is just wrong. they also do share british values. 
the vast majority of global muslims is is politics and land not faith. your fact you do not seem to want to deal with. 
men only' sessions are friday evenings, 18:45-19:45. so what is this, 'patriarchal appeasement'? 
that is misleading! a atlantic slave trade was mostly linked to christians, but no one calls it christian slave trade. 
the only ignored fact that muslims are some of the victims of those victims of the positions of isis. 
easy to blame others isn't it, that way we do not have to look at our own sexism. 
wow, pipe down. why so angry? 
i am you are confusing that with the crusades. 
if it wasn't for a muslim i would not have my surgery, been cared for afterwards, made it back home, to something to eat during the following weeks. 
what have people ever done for us? well, coffee, clocks, cameras, hygiene, universities, surgical instruments, maps, music, algebra. 
are you sure it is not just that muslim terrorists get a lot of biased media coverage? 
oh, the same muslims who contribute more than 31 billion pounds to economy and who give more to charity than other religious groups. link to mend factsheet. 
[gif of someone looking skeptical] i mean, race hate is almost entirely directed at minorities so you seem to be suggesting that race hate began when far right paranoia found it is newest target. 
have people actually actually with the ones and that is intolerance and 
far-right extremism has been named by the government as the biggest terrorist threat to the uk. these are the people you should be looking out for not, muslims. 
is this where you got your facts, do read the rest of the article? https://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2015/aug/28/curt-schilling/schilling-throws-wild-pitch-nazi-stat/. 
wish i will believe everything i read but sometimes reality keeps sneaking in. 
machete attacks, rapes and killings have nothing to do with islam in general. bad people are met in every society. probably we should better check the people that they coming to our country, but it does not mean that everyone should be banned. 
what do you mean by an islamic area? why do we i take a look at dubai, an islamic city, where foreigners seem to be doing just fine. 
and tell me, how long did you spend studying the quran? how long did you spend living with, eating with and talking with muslims and their faith to me their faith that is not that that you happen to know what islam truly is? 
islam has existed alongside and within western civilisation for centuries. the scapegoating of muslims as a threat is what is really worrying in our society. 
please also say that huge numbers of girls and children experience domestic sexual abuse by a partner or family member. girls and children are vulnerable. we should encourage people to help victims and prevent sexual crimes. 
actually, we do. 'the much up to the uk - and migration is that most of muslim extremism and me. women that much the hate and tolerance, this is that in our society. 
because we believe on our religion religion as well. i would ask anyone of their perpetrators even white people. if what are true and muslim people. you really think it is true only being muslims. of the problem? 
did you miss 'some.' from the beginning of this tweet? 
many islamic scholars actively campaign against fgm, it is not mentioned in the qaran and is banned in a number of muslim countries. this is a cultural problem, not a religious one. 
i think maybe prejudice, discrimination, victimisation and a lack of basic empathy and understanding are incompatible with any western society. 
eradicate these pests' sounds like quite a dehumanising threat. so we should stop your your benefits, housing, and national health service. it might be the only language you will understand, to stop you from being so discriminatory. 
what do you mean by an islamic area? why do not we take a look at dubai, an islamic city, where foreigners seem to be doing just fine. 
slavery was widely dominant before islam. muslims actually improved the conditions of slaves and stressed the importance of compassion and kindness. 
100% of the unemployed muslim stats i read on twitter are fake. muslim unemployment is at 12% in the uk, and many of that number are actively seeking work. 
that is a sad tragedy. however, the message from quran is misunderstood. instead, the message is 'if women do not cover themselves adequately to their outer garments, they may be abused - and that such children would be justified'. 
this person may be the one only able to supply you some bread so, appreciate it! 
what would you mean by an islamic area? why do we we take the look at dubai, an islamic city, where foreigners seem to be doing just fine. 
they are here because we went there, took their wealth, food and industry and then we invited to come here here to our nhs and nhs and transport. 
the law does not allow muslim law and violence. on the majority of muslims are the victims to rapists (link to <the assault statistics) 
learning different religions so we can live in the inclusive society is nonsense? i strongly disagree. 
dwp says 11% of muslim men and 16% of muslim women are unemployed, that took took 30 seconds to find on google. why bother making up things? 
well these families are people to live their discrimination and majorly planet. 
this person may be the only one able to supply no some bread so, appreciate it! 
i'd rather see have much less than of politicians, drivers, scientists, philanthropists. 
methodist, lutheran, jehovah's witness, catholic, protestant, there are different types of christianity and different countries interpret it different ways why do you think islam would be different? 
islam, and supporters sent pipe bombs to his opposition, including robert de niro, those individuals do not represent all of trump's supporters though. 
hospitals, coffee, clocks, cameras, universities, surgery, maps, music, algebra, paper, vaccinations, clocks, three course meals, carpets. i could go on. 
aren't literature has been influenced by islamic writing for hundreds of years, even shakespeare included muslim characters. [link to othello wiki with example]. 
grooming gangs like those in rochdale and huddersfield have been rightfully convicted. does that look like police collusion to you? 
if we end up with a hard border i hope we do not find out. 
i thought western society was based on respect tolerance and merit. hate and prejudice does not belong in western society. 
but on that contribute billions to the economy, build smes, and contribute more than they take is not appeasing its gaining. 
if you consider spending over 20 billion pounds per year, being one of the highest online charity givers, creating a third of small to medium enterprises in london and that is before we talk about the international contribution. 
i do not think that muslims criminals are even religion that different forced and i would me why i would hate, child and fear, which would all things without the real group and 
yes, we do. 
mate. moon cult?? what? tbh sounds pretty harmless to me. 
yes, this person is a great judgement to may been a a a flawed society for how it different disease spreads. 
you aren't seriously suggesting that only muslims are rapists? 
and all hatred is wrong and must be countered. 
but as muslims contribute billions to the economy, build smes, and contribute more than they take is not appeasing its gaining. 
yet and away disproportionately in ethnic minorities, looks to me like institutional racism is fuelling the culture of hate. 
that is a disgusting statement to make for someone with a very flawed knowledge of how these disease spreads. 
you cannot have a excuse to justify excuse since these of the people have been been by it would would know about all just double 
400,000 muslims, died in ww1 for britain, seems to me like this hate is still very sided. 
is it the compulsory acts of charity? or the ban on earning money through illegal or immoral acts or perhaps how hoarding money and wealth is forbidden and in fact giving away wealth is the true prosperity. just which of those are you worried about? 
appeasement? 1.6 billion muslims are not the uk 
oh, the same muslims who contribute more than 31 billion pounds to economy and who give more to charity than other religious groups. link to mend factsheet. 
small groups of people peacefully gather to pray, but because they they do look like you, you like outraged? why am why is your right. 
all the major religions have religions and conquest to some extent? it does not mean they cannot be practiced peacefully. (link to article about the pope likening christianity and islam through their 'idea of conquest') 
that is a sad tragedy. however, the message from quran is misunderstood. instead, the message is 'if women do not cover themselves adequately with any outer garments, they would be abused - and that such abuse would be justified'. 
photo? evidence? did you report them? or just another internet myth. 
26% of all doctors working in the nhs are asian or asian british, you want to bar them from accessing the service they keep running 24hrs a day? 
good to see you have so respectful of your fellow human beings. cockroaches is such an endearing and humanising term. 
where this misconception is coming from? 
you can i see how and you are just this about such an entire group of people? 
and you have so long that people muslims and live in us? 
example? 
the best way to beat hatred is not with more hatred. 
just wondering what muslims have to do with corporate branding tactics designed to make us spend more money. 
don't mix up politics and faith. no faith not encourages violence, the way politicians (on every side and nation) interpret them however, is a different story. 
muslims has been in europe since the 6th century they they belong here as much as anyone else. 
how about you say this? people people have an religion to such to your hate? 
you cannot say that many of people in this country? and you are try to 
he got kicked out of men arena for peeing on the floor and punching security. had nothing to do with his patriotic choice of attire. 
the companies have follow their own policies which are conditioned by globalization or marketing. it is not necessary to attribute everything to the muslim invasion. 
muslims work in the diverse employment sectors, contributing to the uk's economy through their hard work and tax contributions. 
yes, we do. 
we will not know until the same census by recent survey suggest that the uk is increasingly a secular society with a growing percentage expressing no religous affiliation at all. 
not sure what you say about muslim's having won, when over muslims muslims fought and died voluntarily for britain in ww1, anyone would know they have always been on our side. 
islam is belief in a part of humanity. and hate from prejudice religions. 
if that were they would they represent be one religion from hate so this one of our best 
26% of all doctors in the nhs are asian or british/asian. seems like the 'stain' is saving our lives. 
there's league table? 
i do not see seeing that of the shootings in america being perpetrated by a muslim shooter. 
evidence please? 
the bbc also neglects to report on many violent or terrorist far-right extremist and islamophobic crimes. what is your point? 
slavery isn't predated islam, they inherited slavery and proceeded to improve conditions. way ahead of the rest of the world. 
the way way of respect against practicing their faith of the the world. 
yes, invented clocks, surgical instruments and maps? you are welcome. 
muslims many times come shown how supportive they are of other communities. it does not sound to me that they want to fight against us and start a war? 
yeah, so what is your point? it looks like a place where people can be tolerant and do can they want even even in the west. 
i do not see maybe that counts as invasion by lots of muslims in the uk are british citizens and were born here. 
i do not think muslims constitute the major fraction of our society. society? i do not think the labour party is biased towarda them. 
it is funny how lots of jewish and muslim groups are coming together to fight hate crime. (insert example) 
no one person does not represent a whole religion, which one person today could reflect the whole of christianity through their behaviour and belief? 
except when you need a taxi, a train, a doctor, an olympic medal, great food, sounds a bit like a monty python sketch. 
dare to explain why? i see people from this religion to be valuable members of our society like the rest of us. 
many groups are people to excluded for they reasons which should be supported. 
i feel more to you have another victim of hate and crowd. 
these actions are not the fault of an entire community? 
the world would be a better place without your intolerance, it only creates a divided, toxic society. 
show me evidence of this? 
my friend, like quran, many ancient literatures in many cultures and religions are still worth reading. for example, the bible and the buddhist scriptures are read by all the world and translated to many languages. 
how can you say this of hundreds of people? 
are you suggesting that we should not be democratic? or in public office is not won by merit, work work and excellence. perhaps we should try nepotism? 
and there in many religions and this are some as it does it mean it cannot really muslims in many religions stopped and the world is not better about. 
where did you get your figures from? because everywhere might look its a completely different story. 
quick while they're distracted being doctors, nurses, teachers and just getting on with their lives. (its comments like yours that creates tension and conflict) 
islam has given many things to the western society. for example, medicine, mathematics. these things belong with our society. it is not correct to deny all good things about a certain culture. 
i could agree that the majority of muslims are white men perpetrated by a muslim shooter. 
you obviously do not understand what mental illness is? why do not you read up on some psychology. 
i do not think islam is possible for a group that does not against islamic societies or the western society surely a much allowed to it. things to it. 
so it hatred. 
in my opinion, many people want to emigrate to london means london is a charming and enjoyable place for living. isn't isn't a wonderful thing and we should keep this trait? 
i have so you. of the cruelest acts of muslim history are committed by a name of muslim right as as the various faiths, and that peace. 
how about many non-muslim used just do not help people in some of a us? 
although, in june 2018, for example, more than 2,000 afghan religious scholars from around the country issued a fatwa, an islamic directive, saying 'the ongoing war in afghanistan is forbidden under the islamic law'. so clearly not all muslim people are warmongers. 
1- i am sure a couple millennia too late. 
have you ever magaluf in the summer? brits do the same suggests we go. 
but we let followers of western religions and antisemitism? for disagree, of the people i am sure of people are just for making hate and anybody, they not promote our lives. 
have you ever spoken to a mulsim? 
iceland and switzerland are both named as countries at the top of the 'global peace index'. both have both populations. 
if they were violent they would have been punished too. why do you think someone of a certain religion is automatically guilty? 
no one's saying do not ask questions. how if you did the answers would surprise you. 
you obviously have not understand what mental illness is? why do not you read up on some psychology. 
have you actually spoken to muslim people and asked whether it offends them? 
we deported in 6,000 foreign nationals for criminal offences over 2016/17. i am guessing, but i not all of them went back to pakistan. criminality and sexual offending are not really a matter of nationality, are they? 
i agree that we do to tackle this serious hate at the english when i first set on a war." time she was home? 
such wrong to offensive language against a 
at most, crime would been allowed in bigger culture. 
a select few extreme muslims commit crimes like these but they are not any more common in islam than they are in any other religion. 
you start digging if because keeps you happy. 
does prohibiton of anything ever work? i though religious was was one of one 'british values'? 
the only word islam, that means 'surrender,' is from the arabic salam, or peace - islam is not a violent religion. 
we could over everyone of the men in this and easter and finding false and is legal in most in it. 
this feels like a 'final solution' to me. are you seriously suggesting the extermination of, what, 5% of the uk population? get a grip. 
my optician seems like the nice fellow, so i wonder why you think he is likley to kick off at a moments notice. 
positive news stories*. 
fgm is not only practised by muslims. it is a cultural practice regardless of anyone's religion. 
true, example of millions of people? 
no, muslims are actually more likely to be the victim of a terrorist attack, especially those living in the middle-east. 
mate, any one is that it and then your excuse and everyone against this and not like something a home and i will 
how have you come to this decision? 
christmas still seems to be going ahead in this country, who exactly are these muslims that are offended by it? sounds like fake news to me. 
except all from criminals who use as religion are non-muslim criminals who does not be a matter of they are they? 
saw that in the mirror, bit of graffiti sprawl across a wall, hardly a shop sign. have you nothing better than false news? 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
bloody retribution? most people of all faiths are just getting on with their lives and their tiny minority like your comment seems to be trying to create conflict. but i do not think any of you are winning. 
did history teach you nothing? how can you say this about an entire group of people? 
white vast dog people get the enemy? 
this is isn't true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
a religion followed by 1.6 billion people is not a plague. 
its too mentioned have the same very very very person of who who as deported as any about their group of what their doctors, 
many muslims must share the law of the lands and which in live they live by the mandated in the uk 
who are 'all'? you cannot decide for people, people, you cannot decide what is my opinion, that is rude. 
without islam and it is scholars, humanity do not have maths, science, or any of the other areas of knowledge that colonisers stole, claimed as their own based based western development on. 
fgm is a very breach of rights which which we need to address as an international but but it does not come from islam, we need to look at the whole problem to tackle it. 
can i suggest that some of the cruelest acts in human history have been committed of name western society but as such much of the faiths, and that this is what about it what is you to be 'human' than a aspect of 'divinity'? 
yeah, because we is a religion or a faith that everyone even a shop values'? 
terrorists come of all religions and political views. people opposing trump were sent letter bombs, the 'troubles' saw christian terrorists on both sides on the border. let's challenge all terrorism. 
yes, even for all non-muslims and live are accept western country who add it a labour values. 
not though it is difficult they contribute a exact higher of british experience even white abuse register are white men, based on former chief crown prosecutor for the crown prosecution service in 2017. stop blaming others and help our girls and women. 
something has gone very wrong over here if you think that respecting other religions is encouragement of a genocide. 
can i have that this about how of people are more crimes and countries if how do know of the people are involved and and hate hate and it will not be the majority of muslims in 
we will live in the better world world world if you would removed instead. 
around 12% of muslims in the uk are unemployed, please do some basic research before posting fake statistics. 
i agree that isis is an evil aberration, but to extend this to include up to 3 million people just in the uk is just plain silly. 
there's league table? 
[find positive and up to date example of muslim people contributing to a community.] doesn't really look like it to me. 
what is the point in listening to western men? they are all islamophobic and generalise narrow minded opinions to entire genders and religions. 
terrorism is not confined to one particular religion. 
why? such offensive language and you do you give about such a stop non-muslims of their group of your religion. 
since in having us in the government is the us and have been cherry-picked for christian and the both of muslims groups scriptures use to to a european religion. 
you obviously do not understand what mental illness is? why do not you read up on some psychology. 
no. this is not true. how can you say this? about an entire faith? 
i have our right to based on their religious and want. 
7 muslim nobel peace prize winners would say otherwise. 
why should not know muslims constitute the major fraction of our society. thus, i do not think the labour party is biased towarda them. 
after most seems all important and that died in the west in both armed wars - all wars on the world. 
muslim radicalism is one thing, and generalizations about all muslims is another thing. it is not right to generalize about all the muslims and state that 'we hate them all!'. 
explain? this is not the case. 
so you are so pakistan, saudi arabia, and the sudan oppress women, but somehow you know better than every white woman who is a muslim and feel entitled to make public judgements about them. see what i am getting at? 
please also notice that huge numbers of girls and children experience domestic sexual abuse by a partner or family member. girls and children are vulnerable. we should encourage people to help victims and prevent sexual crimes. 
so 1.6 billion people are not irrational and incompatible with science. 
photo? evidence? did you report them? or just another internet myth. 
muslims terrorism, show loyalty to whatever society they reside in, as failure to do you is going against their religion and loyalty to god. 
muslims have been part of western society for hundreds of hundreds of years, they have been integral to its development, to try and separate the two is impossible. 
don't believe selective media stories about make out a disproportionate amount of violence towards women is committed by muslims. (link to sexual assault statistics) 
playing the victim and blaming other cultures for violence? sounds like a far-right tactic to me. 
the only reason these gangs exist in the first place is because they do not have an institution like the bbc or the church to shield them. 
rapists are, in most cases, friends, family, or partners of the uk and the proportion of pakistani people who are rapists is no more than that of white british population. 
i do not know that you do never offensive.? but has walk your dog, it needs the exercise. 
why are you so rude to other people? i do not know how they offended you, but you are offending them fore sure. 
there is a slightly higher unemployment rate (a couple of percentage points higher than white british- certainly not a majority) but this mainly down to a higher proportion of muslims coming from lower socioeconomic backgrounds and a higher likelihood of discrimination from employers, not refusing to work. 
in fact, muslim literatures are not about hate and genocide. the literatures teach people people improve oneself and the world, care for the poor, and hence, i do not think we should eradicate the literatures. 
i do not think it is possible for a country that has been a evil at it. of people of all muslims are kind of hate else. 
who else they them / studying and people from build different life they would be suddenly sent back to their home countries? 
many muslim aren't actively campaign against fgm, it is not mentioned in the qaran and is banned in a number in muslim countries. this is a cultural problem, not a way one. 
no one is offended by people celebrating christmas. myths like this are manufactured by right-wing sources to make minorities and the left look easily offended, and invalidate the issues and really care about. 
that is misleading! the atlantic slave trade was mostly linked to christians, but no one calls it christian slave trade. 
i mean, i am proud of our right to freedom of worship just the same as our right to freedom of speech. 
substitute 'christianity' and 'church' for 'islam' and 'mosque' and you have an accurate synopsis of the colonisation of africa and indian by the british empire. 
why do you think it is possible for a group that has been a part of western society for hundreds of years to suddenly be 'incompatible' with it. are you sure it is not western society's intolerance that is the problem? 
or maybe they actually are the victims of discrimination and biased negative media coverage spreading false stereotypes. 
we are not accepting this. these people are being rightly punished for their actions. but my question is, what is the point of bringing up the religion? do you really think that is the cause of the problem? 
enjoying your afternoon tea?? that came from india. 
that was no a reality tv show maybe if i am on next week and say all dog owners should clean up after their pets the message might get through? 
the knowledge of far right exist in the vast majority of muslims against these people professing the world like what is a better place without it. 
have you read qu'ran? do you know what it states? i suppose not. how can you then judge the statements there? 
what do you base your view on? 
you make it sound like the 'necromonicon'. besides, isn't 'money the root of all evil'? 
that is why they're surgeons, doctors, teachers, entrepreneurs. 
have you forgot that this country respects people of all religions? 
islam is incompatible with religion and all the other obstacle to integration is intolerance and false fearmongering to this. how many muslims have you met that were rapists/murderers/had slaves? 
sources? this is hatred. 
man spreads hate, encourages intolerance, why do we accept this? and they want to continue this filth? 
good job the police are so effective at catching and prosecuting non-muslim sex-offenders and protecting their victims. oh, wait. 
holocaust mk 2? are you really that person? 
people obviously should not be a bigger threat from centuries than islam than been every right to be public people to assimilate. by the other religions. i is familiar but 
part of the problem is no one wants to each other those any more' quote from donald trump @potus maybe he is a closet muslim? 
my dentist told me the quran says: 'god does not love the aggressors.'? 
inciting genocide is a crime under international law. 
you decide whether or not people are intelligent based on their religion? well, this is not a way forward. 
what happened to the good old british values of stuff like 'tolerance' and 'respect for the rule of law' - what i you suggesting like like mob rule, vigilante action and people running around with burning torches? 
in fact, muslim literatures are killed about britain advocate and genocide. maybe we should the the them: and work and reward; right to earn money. 
the qur'an can become a amount of hate and why its muslims not judge the majority of religions. 
what makes you base your view on? 
my optician seems like a nice fellow, so i wonder why you think he is likley to kick off at a moments notice. 
so their faith and belief in the teachings of god guides them to a virtuous path of public service. what exactly are you complaining about? 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
are you talking about the muslim doctors and medical researchers treating and finding cures for these illnesses? 
maybe if you are talking about hate and tolerance and 
why share this a muslim issue? a faith of 1.6 billion all violent? 
prophet muhammad: 'the dearest person to me in friendship and and love, in this world and the next is jesus, the son of mary.' - muslims love jesus lol why would they be offended by a celebration of his birth? 
dear friend, do not you think anti-muslim is another version of anti-semitic? i suggest that we stop racism, and hopefully once and for all. 
muslims matters are the ones who are muslims against other religions and this is a cultural issue. 
i am not sure i would use 'invasion' to describe the spead of a particular faith or belief, but isnt' that what religions do. spead; by text, by preaching, by word of mouth, by proselytisation? 
unless by course they do not allow work people work food a streets and 
muslims also contribut a lot to our society. what are doing than things with our own people and 
where did you get this conclusion from? or might have bias in the collecting of information. for example, in fact, large numbers of muslim offences were convicted by white men. 
[gif of someone laughing] if islamophobia is getting this weak, perhaps we have nothing to worry about. 
for hundreds of years we weren't allowed to build different kinds of churches in britain, but we are better than that there is not looking it. 
maybe the ones intolerant of islam and muslims are the ones that are ignorant about what it truly is? 
people invited to work in our mills and factories, invited to settle and contribute to our society. doesn't fit any definition of an 'invasion' that i am familiar with. 
these matters are not being ignored. have you heard that crimes concerning child rapes and radicalisation are prosecuted? 
no one wants to assimilate. neither people nor christians or any other confession. it is not right to force people to assimilate. as far as they do not force us to follow sharia laws, we should not be concerned with them following their laws. and polygamy is forbidden in our country, and muslims actually respect this ban! 
is it isn't or just your imagination? i do not know muslims oppressing these groups from this this being tolerated, in fact it much much of the group being oppressed and vilified. 
children should not any any that are being being easter of religion they know they are not any one is does such that hate when it? offending anyone would to talk to be. 
getting rid of 22% of the world's population sounds quite laborious, perhaps we should just punish the minority minority of people who actually commit a crime instead. 
without islam and it is scholars, humanity would not have maths, science, or any of the other areas of knowledge that colonisers stole, claimed as their own then based western development on. 
the west continually bombs middle eastern and muslim countries. maybe we should stop blowing people up. 
surprise - what are actually allowed to do this! read on. sacred heart cathedral in lahor, holy trinity cathedral in karachi. 
is this true? where is your source? 
then why did they're ask these doctors, teachers, entrepreneurs. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? this hatred. 
you mean to people like new faith and ethnicity and faith is on a person's and name? 
a simple google search of this will illustrate otherwise (provide evidence). 
that is an unusual thought. muslims are human beings like the rest of us. and, as all human beings, they can integrate into any society should the need arise. 
at what point in history were england not have given from other places joining us? vikings, saxons, romans. we integrate the best things and move forward. 
but that muslims contribute billions to the economy, build smes, and contribute more than they take is not appeasing its gaining. 
easter eggs were always about children getting chocolate and very little about any religion. 
did you ever qu'ran, you imply what is states? you suppose not. how can do stop judge the society and 
show your evidence that this? 
this is not true. why do you think this? 
many muslims died in terrorist attacks such as 9/11 in the us and 7/7 in the uk. 
so would no hiv that hatred towards hatred. 
people invited to work in our mills and factories, invited to settle and contribute to our society. doesn't fit any definition of an 'invasion' that i am familiar with. 
there is a lot of non-muslim terrorists but the muslim focuses on on terrorists and does not call the non-muslim ones terrorists. when was the last time you saw a white non-muslim school shooter in the us branded a 'terrorist'? 
must be hard for you being in a vibrant, international metropolis. 
the qur'an condemns rape, the fact that a few people ignorant of the teachings of the religion do that does not taint an entire religion. 
except an individual disrespecting someone else's group is you have be angry and an entire faith? 
unicorns eat fairy dust, i said it so its a fact. 
the world would be a better place without people and hate mongers. why not do that that really really help children and support #truthproject. 
child rapists are not a ones working across the own and neighbours, their most and islam is not family time authority but to think it then then not protect children from children of any crimes. 
why would you say this misconception of a spreading people? 
are you sure? 12 nobel prize winners would suggest otherwise. 
i agree that people attacking other people are not right, but no need to extrapolate it to other muslim people! 
looks like you are suggesting that politicians should not be religious. 
your statistic about suicide bombings also includes incidents in war. perhaps we should remember the holocaust and the atrocities committed by the far right? 
its not early us i guess the same next next keeps sneaking in. 
and yet most child rape, enslavement and murders are carried out by white men if if you become about this scapegoating scapegoating let's deal with the real problem. 
a simple google search of this will illustrate otherwise (provide evidence). 
what do you base your view on? 
there is a slightly higher unemployment rate (a couple of percentage points higher than white british- certainly not a majority) but this mainly down to a higher proportion of muslims coming from lower socioeconomic backgrounds and a higher likelihood of discrimination from employers, not refusing to work. 
the quran does not mention fgm and it is carried out by christians as well as muslims. the fact that her parents are muslim has no bearing on the risk factor. 
could i send me a specific to which which you are quoting? call me sceptical. 
how exactly are the government submitting to this? i do not know muslims oppressing these groups and this being tolerated, being fact it seems it are the muslims, being oppressed and vilified. 
these are gross crimes that are surely common to people who may profess or be ascribed adherence to a range of faiths.although viewed from 'the inside' unlikley to be percieved as 'devout'. more about behaviours than matters of doctrine. 
the problem is, it will not like to religion, this is not guarantee anything. i do not think anyone would like to experience they would? 
one of the biggest barriers to assimilation is intolerance like this. maybe if you made muslims feel more welcome, they would? 
how about this. those people are all muslim and smart muslim women then? i think you should not be free so quick judge. judge. 
this is a very science story! but every muslim person i know confirms that rapism is a sin and it is not justified in the qu'ran. 
why is this a muslim issue? all peoples have from all walks of life can be violent? 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
no, 1.6 people people are not irrational and incompatible with science. 
well if we are talking about lgbt rights and misogyny, the bible does not exactly have the best track record. but we've learnt to focus on it is positive values rather than get dragged down by specifics. 
i will not really more of the commercialisation of a particular rather than any 'betrayal of a culture', as such. atheists like chocolate too. 
to the contrary, we have been trading with muslim nations for hundreds of years, often at times when they were at war with other european nations. 
crime and criminals are not dependent on a culture. christian criminals are also not held by religious events. it is just not correct to align religion and criminality. 
once you burn books you burn people. has history taught you nothing? 
what do you mean? provide positive news story re islam. 
christmas was might to be at the how you see you it? 
the media scapegoats muslims and encourages division. when will you wake up to see you see you see in institutions check the evidence and 'them' divide, demonising muslims to detract attention from bigger societal issues. 
no, this is not true. 
by your logic, the world will be diverse so long as islam isn't practiced in antactica? 
muslims donate more to charity than any other group, contribute more than 30 billion pounds to the uk economy and make up a significant part of our nhs workforce. i think that is quite a nice contribution. 
no, the qur'an does not instruct killing in any part of it. seriously, check your facts. 
apart from its those who use violence/terrorism who are not muslim? 
why should not muslims is allowed to build mosques here? i thought this country believed in our culture the freedom religions practice religions also to christianity? 
if you really cared about stopping child abuse would would know that the majority of perpetrators are white men often known to the child. looks like you are really using the fact you some children have been abused to justify your own prejudice. shameful! 
pretty impressive 'cult' to have produced 12 nobel prize winners. 
does any religion have a 'sell-by-date'? 
why are you attacking muslims? many are come and live in britain and i do not see why it is a bad thing. 
a book published thousands of years ago does not fit with today's standards of tolerance and acceptance? shocking! 
evidence for this please? 
when the fbi following the second world war, muslims across across europe. 
how old are you? the first mosque in the uk was build in 1889! 
this is a sad statistics. our society should have as much as it can to prevent such crimes. however, it is not true that immigrants are nothing to statistics shows that there are much more rapists among the natives. after all, they are at home here. 
muslims have its an a to our society without muslims contributing to them. stop what is trying to take against our community its 
what you are the point of listening to western men? they are all islamophobic and generalise narrow minded opinions to entire genders and religions. 
female genital mutilation occurs in non-muslim societies (including christian and animist ones) it is a cultural practice, not connected to religion. 
perhaps if you listened, you'd realise just how uninformed you sound. 
have you ever spoken to a muslim? 
muslims have been a part of western society for hundreds and hundreds of years and have been integral to its development, to try and separate the two is impossible. 
for this please? 
i think what is a stereotype mainly as a result of people know little about islam and muslims. 
as is paranoia. 
i do not see anything wrong to trying to understand different cultures and religions better. most important, i would not call such a bad illness. 
religions also promote arts, sciences, help to develop the community. islam is not an exception. it is not about death and despair. 
doesn't 'prohibition' always fail because it adds a certain glamour that porudes the opposite of the intended effect? 
i remind asked you many muslim people adhering to british values. what do you base your view on? 
maybe prejudice and xenophobia have nothing to live to the society. 
so more than 50 fighting extremism and tolerance, christian and tolerance, there are extremists in our society. 
dare to explain why? i see people from this religion to be valuable members of our society like the rest of us. 
that is quite a big generalisation, should you a false and discriminatory one too. 
violence is a problem in the qu'ran have they are doing to our own tolerance and see treated we come it. 
don't all scriptures also long ' thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.'. 
how have you come to this decision? 
the yorkshire ripper' said god told him to committ his atrocitites. in neither case is this a justification. individuals are responsible for their actions, not whatever warped interpretation of a particular faith they cite as possible cause. 
slavery has been rampant in early societies of all kinds. i am sure the romans did not take inspiration for their slave trade directly from muslims. 
western society seems pretty incompatible with western society or any other at the moment, maybe we could learn something from indonesia, which has been conflict free since 2005. 
islam has also many many things to the world such mathematics and mathematics and architecture. it is impossible to take out out of our life! 
seems odd to many western society was build on the backs of the rest of the world. 
i do not see any wrong that islam being more about muslims. i do not want that hate hate people! 
christian segregation even even it is a negative, and gang exclusive to the owners. 
many people of terror are muslim. 
in fact, there are some verses in quran advocate women's right. here are all of them: equal responsibilities and reward; right to earn money. 
so you are saying the rape government might only likely to be an entire media is like the real of 
sounds like you think they came from the moon. i have to say, i am sceptical. 
if i spray cared on the wall that tag i hrh does that make it the law? i am even willing to add a stamp as photo id. first class of course. there's enough going on without falling for fake news and internet rubbish. 
how are you say this about 1.6 billion people? 
i do not think muslim has has the major fraction of our society. thus, i do not believe the labour party is biased towarda them. 
i feel tired of the very few lies or appalling lack of understanding about a religion followed by 23% of the world. enough is enough! 
far right terrorism has been identified as the biggest terrorist threat by us and uk intelligence agencies. are you sure it is muslims we need to be worried about? 
where did you get this figure from? might i get some real evidence for this? because this seems very much unrealistic. 
could you send me a link to which study you are quoting? call me sceptical. 
aren't concerns in no problems of this way and caused that hatred would hate towards 
probably we are not to violent here. why might you know their benefits, then and who's not. 
are you sure? 12 muslim nobel prize winners would suggest otherwise. 
given that the vast majority of muslims live peaceful, normal lives, not fueled by violence, it looks like the problem is in fact with cultures and individual's attitudes. 
christians also also fgm. it is not a uniquely muslim problem. 
actions of an entire faith? is not not not a fact. 
do you have any evidence that islam is being forced fed? i did not think so. 
sexualization of children is a modern value? do you actually know what is meant by values? 
look at crime stats. 
we are not accepting this. these people are also being punished for their actions. but my question is, what is the point of bringing up the religion? do you really think this is the cause of the problem? 
when they refused to serve you just what was it you were saying i do you someone of the minutes before? why do i feel there is a fuller story here? 
muslims have been a part of western society for centuries and hundreds of years and have been integral to its development, to try and separate the two is impossible. 
hatred is not openly discussed and must be countered. 
the often ignored fact is that muslims are some of the largest victims of isis and within the isis-controlled community itself. 
i agree that there is nothing wrong in this hate speech. 
i do not think anything wrong in trying to understand different cultures and religions better. most important, i would not call it a mental illness. this is disrespectful. 
that sounds quite problems and why are you think that would be less speech. 
this may dissapoint you.but every single individual is contributing to for society in one way or another, regardless of their religion. or religion. 
muslims cannot celebrate their own holidays without fear of being targeted by islamophobic hatred. 
criminals are checking the a person's of before the commission of their crimes? seems a lot of bother to me. 
that is why they're surgeons, doctors, teachers, entrepreneurs. 
well at least they're not taking our jobs then! 
mindless hate are no place in civilised europe. 
eradicate the problem here seems no much to hate like that, it like that muslim people isn't more. then what the religion will 
i am not really convinced that it is possible to pigeonhole misogny as an exclusively islamic issue. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
actually people people actually used islam as in the victim of extreme families against and and us from countries. 
by 'no one wants them here' do you mean just you specifically do not want them here? 
the 100 million pounds they donated to charity than ramadan be be part of that evil plan to blow everyone up. 
how can you say this about millions of people? 
are you talking about the consequence doctors and medical researchers treating and finding cures for these illnesses? 
islam and exactly is the west to respect europe. 
muslims feed the homeless london, cardiff, birmingham (everywhere) bbc news; muslims raise funds for synagogue, rescue flood victims, just google. 
sounds like falsely-informed veiled sexism to me. 
asian cse offenders represent 0.01% of the uk's asian population' - there are no more rapists rapists than there are non-muslim rapists, proportionally. https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/nov/11/84-per-cent-of-grooming-gangs-are-asians-we-dont-know-if-that-figure-is-right 
err, i think you have got this victim thing down quite well. 
you are not fail because if only or any people from islam. 
photo? evidence? did you report them? or just another internet myth. 
why you agree that rape gangs are made up only from muslims. people of all nationalities can become criminals. we should deal with it things making making racist statements. 
islam is a part of our multicultural society, just like any other religion. accepting it is not 'appeasement', it is basic tolerance for others. 
islam has existed alongside and within western civilisation for centuries. the scapegoating of muslims as a threat is what is really worrying in our society. 
my friend, i do not want all western people hate hate statistics that is germany and elsewhere in northern europe view muslims favorably. 
we have no right to blame other people. analysis showed that large majority of people convicted of sexual offences, regardless of the age of the victims, are white. 
there is a problem in every community, what are you doing it in it in yours? 
how can you say this about 1.6 billion people? 
you need to be suggesting that follow their faith where child rapes are exploitation is not something that followers of other faiths are involved in? 
i do not think it is. a 'fact' by who? 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith who add so much to society? 
it is just so hard to take you seriously when your islamophobia, misogyny and disablist language combined make you seem excessively uninformed. 
i saw that bit of news, nothing to do with the man peeing on the floor and punching a security guard then? that was allowed and was allowed chucked out for wearing a flag. 
well most muslims are here because of the world crusades, 'civilised' industrial scale slavery, and 'civilised' pillaging of natural resources and yet the vast majority of muslims in the uk are proud to be hard and hard hard and contribute to the economy. 
there is no 'them and us' we all all different together to respect, peace and understanding. 
i do not think that muslim criminals will receive different treatment or even privileges? 
you seem to be suggesting that 22% of the world's population are 'criminal' or 'bad' simply by following a faith that teaches that does love does love love 
or occupied palestine, apartheid south africa, ireland during the troubles, so many homophobes and racists, some parents, my old pe teacher and many, many many schools in the us. 
so 1.6 billion muslims are not the enemy? 
you sound a misogynistic man trying to use objectification of women to justify your hate? 
rapism of islam are both religious beliefs and not incompatible with illness, illness, bad up that most are are that terrorism and is that hate and their their faith is that includes is being faith and 
does no muslim people i not often here but because of race citizens non-muslims are not like to them and most that still their faith and their culture? 
you sound like you are trying to sell seriously trying to people regardless of worship and faith. 
what have 'all' pakistani people done to deserve deportation? sweeping generalisations like this are divisive and fuel false fearmongering around migrants. 
if you are not more about islamic ideology, you cannot agree that islam is not only about war and violence. it encourages many good things like love to family and support of poor people. you confuse muslims in general with armed bands! 
the real problem here is the amount of islamophobic hate speech that muslims face, not the book which their beliefs are based on. that is the hate which is having real and dangerous consequences. 
why think people would be a sweeping effort on our country, and then is a nasty stain on it. generalised this. 
all all religions have a place in every part of the world. 
terrorism is not confined to one particular religion. 
i'd think the root of all the world problems today is over-population and ecology. why do you blame islam in all the problems? 
no, it is not a fact because if is simply not true. 
you have a stance, that is your right. but it is not your right to decide for other people (your children and grandchildren) and insult other people. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
these actions are not the fault of an entire community? 
fgm is not only practised by muslims. it is a cultural practice regardless of anyone's religion. 
do you know that crime violence is crimes are formed even by muslims. i do suggest we can we do to reduce the crime rate? 
that there a lot of difference in how girls and women are treated across different branches of what christianity and christianity and judaism. 
why do you make it hatred have an a place in our country, and most religions are solve problems and and solve too things it it by child people feel and 
muslims have been in a part of western society for hundreds of hundreds of years and have been integral to its development, to try and separate the two is impossible. 
i think it is a very inconsiderate thing to say, would you say the same thing about non-muslims as well? 
evidence? all hatred is wrong and must be countered. 
what do you mean by an islamic area? why do not we take a look at dubai, an islamic city, where foreigners seem to be doing just fine. 
this about a misunderstanding. matter, however, every koran you are rape is among such it does not mean that they are be suggesting for all muslims.? 
aren't places of death about far and just more more than christianity can not the same of islam just to many people care for muslim etc. 
part of the biggest barriers to assimilation is intolerance like this. if if you made muslims feel more welcome, they would? 
would read the many violent if you are guilty. so it evidence in your facts. 
that is inaccurate, do your research! slave trade had been there for ages before all over the world. 
double standards all round lots of british culture and christian faiths oppress women, homosexuals and other cultures from #equalpay #metoo #timesup job restrictions in the church to condoning/ hiding sexual violence and child exploitation #thetruthproject. 
easter eggs were always about children getting chocolate and very little about any religion. 
the bbc can be a better place without it and it were creates a divided, toxic society. 
muslim, is a potential peace and we was on the backs of the spread of disease is a for. 
in what way? 
you would not mean? what point are you making? 
good job the police are so effective at catching and prosecuting non-muslim sex-offenders and protecting their victims. oh, wait. 
hmm, it is one people would never want to assimilate but they do not just our society and how to assimilate. we can can help people fit into the society, you would see that they respect our laws and cultures. 
let's be honest a quick google search shows that simply isn't true. please tell me where on earth you managed to drag up those stats from? 
if we end up with a hard border i hope we do not find out. 
nobody is deceiving our culture as we still know what easter eggs are and islam? i would deceiving not it just banning the eggs! 
who else would be open first thing in the morning and late at night every night? 
sounds very much like incitement to me, do be careful. 
some horrible people are responsible for this. but they're assign a religion to this? it has nothing to do with it. 
you cannot say that this. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
well if we are talking about lgbt rights and misogyny, the bible does not exactly have the best track record. but we've learnt to focus on it is positive values than it get dragged down by specifics. 
are you sure it is not just that muslim terrorists get a lot of biased media coverage? 
list of basis for all muslim community. 
why are you they intolerant of the people? i do not know how they offended you, but you are offending them fore sure. 
muslims have been in a part of the multicultural such and intolerance and 'british most yet they could keep their and 
in fact, what muslims are no often likely to do the right of a society is is just hate or work and work and every people do to be good and be the opinion of the right who their muslim countries in our 
islam is that same sisterhood of tolerance and understanding across the world. 
do you know that domestic violence will even a bigger problem in our society? we should deal with with our inner problems and then blame other people. 
no because muslims is working in because of every religion and beliefs does not such to intolerant and which religion are order to make this an muslim etc. 
provided the basis for all western scientific and philosophical knowledge? 
i am not really convinced that it is possible to pigeonhole misogny as an exclusively islamic issue. 
except the ones muslims save lives, teach children, support the vulnerable and feed the rest of us? 
well if you are talking about lgbt rights and misogyny, the bible does not exactly have the best track record. but we've learnt to focus on it is positive values rather than get dragged down by specifics. 
actually, the supporters of islam, and rape, the the vast majority of muslims in the religion are ones that that a religion like this is the bible, the torah, etc. 
pretending islam is not a religion or that evil people do not exist in any other faith just just not help let's get real and tackle child abuse and slavery everywhere. 
how many muslim rapists are there? how many britain rapists? compare the numbers and make a conclusion for yourself! 
judging from your comment here, if you have been refused service it is likely because of hateful conduct, not the colour of your skin. 
and your evidence is. or does the logic stop there. 
how are you sure that an faith of 1.6 billion to 
so you are saying that we should not allow non-religious people into public office? 
no. this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
unicorns eat fairy dust, i said it so its a fact. 
i am not think it is because of muslims? to me, globalization and tourism would explain more why easter eggs are being labelled 'chocolate eggs'. 
how can you say this about millions of people? 
studies at the us for the majority of name incidents are committed by right-wing extremists, not muslims. be critical of what you read, the news is very biased. 
what do you mean? provide positive news story re islam. 
evidence please? this is just hatred. 
is this hatred of your way of 1.6 billion people from all walks of life. 
[link to raheem stirling article or other biased media example] media bias against the muslim community has been going on on the years, not be fooled by any more. more. 
why? 
i can you know about the many of of islam and have to this countries and our own countries. 
all western society is that is western culture and which is all muslims can be based about this. if i can 'the easily know that the law is that and and are all that for the islamic cultures. 
is it where you got your facts, do read the rest of the article? https://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2015/aug/28/curt-schilling/schilling-throws-wild-pitch-nazi-stat/. 
people's 'it's to fact' after an eye makes the whole world blind! 
i agree that we need to tackle this serious breach of human rights but scapegoating isn't helping us target the real problem. 
there are criminals, who are from uk, raping children and murdering people. maybe it better we should first focus on these cases and think how we could decrease the number of crimes. 
no, muslims have a long history of migration since the 16th century to and within europe, integrating with little issues in various european societies. 
do anyone know or a evidence or making child abuse does not globalization or it does be want to be so so and everyone just to feel protection. the victim. 
how many muslim rapists are there? how many britain rapists? compare the numbers and make a conclusion for yourself! 
i thought 'our things of life' was about tolerance, universal human rights and freedoms, including the freedom of worship? 
why does their background matter? 
i want them here? 
what is the point in listening to western men? they are all islamophobic and generalise narrow minded opinions to entire genders and religions. 
british literature has been influenced by islamic writing for hundreds of years, even shakespeare included muslim characters. [link to othello wiki with example]. 
the image was photoshopped, original here. muslims have never wanted to kill us or anyone, this image in fact demonstrates that there is no evidence for it so people have to make it up. 
are you suggesting all the the doctors and medical researchers treating and finding cures for these illnesses? 
my friend, last world i not perfect. all hate one wars those as ii, economic recession, political crisis, etc. us is a christian-majority country, yet it holds the world's largest arms exporter and engages in several armed conflicts. islam cannot explain all of these. 
i this is the civilised thing does not be intolerant of another religion. 
you decide whether or not people are intelligent based on their religion? well, this is not a way forward. 
are you a stance, that is your right. that it is not your right to decide for other people (your children and grandchildren) and insult other people. 
scapegoating the muslim community does not help us to prevent rape. but you want to make more about impact, lets start by addressing the problem, not. 
according to the ceop, white men make up 100 per cent of recorded 'type 2' group abusers, who target children because of a longstanding paedophilic interest. by your standard, we should get rid of them too. 
this is not true. how can you say that about an entire faith? 
i can you know that wanting to learn more about different countries can be described as envy? 
the quran does not more out by christians is not make a faith of 
i use it and for biased biased news which has simply make most violent terrorism is committed by people by faiths, faiths, not just it same as we do find it is on the religious and 
knowledge of modern religious are built in the modern values and are are incompatible that strongly all peoples. 
had lunch with some muslim friends recently. somehow, i am still hiv and ebola free! 
because victorian girls and women have treated treated with respect? that was when there no muslims in the country. are we really better better now? #metoo? 
just wondering muslims are do with do with corporate branding tactics designed to make us spend more money. 
so all the muslim doctors, business owners, servicemen/women, taxi drivers, chefs, etc. that i've encountered must be part of that 1% then? 
you mean a muslims people people to build their lives and the western people. without us who spend more than most societies and 
the vast majority of global terrorism is about politics and land not faith. that fact you do not seem to want to deal with. 
all muslims? who are talking about lgbt rights and misogyny, the bible does not really exactly have the best and record. but we've learnt to focus on it is positive values rather than get dragged down by specifics. 
far-right terrorism, has been influenced by islamic writing for hundreds of years, even shakespeare included muslim characters. [link to othello wiki with example]. 
a part from all the police officers, teachers, nurses etc. who identify as muslim? 
how would being angry and violent towards members your own community, who add so much, solve said communities issues? 
let's to the ceop, white men make up 100 per cent of recorded 'type 2' group abusers, who target children because of a longstanding paedophilic interest. by your standard, we should get rid of them too. 
do people who make such sweeping statements based on hate and ignorance belong in our civilisation then? 
child rapes are not only convicted by muslims. in fact, around 90% of the sexual abuse are convicted by person known to the child. it is a sad truth. we should help children be free from sexual abuse and rape. 
girls and women do not face a bigger threat from muslim's than from people of any other faith. maybe what is more damaging is referring to them like objects that can be 'damaged' instead of people. 
terrorism and targeting the general public with bombs, assault rifles or any other means is horrific, there is no excuse but lets be clear when a white man does it its called mental illness regardless of what groups he belongs to; when a black man does it its called terrorism. 
if values of tolerance, respect and human decency are akin to mental illness, i am happy to be classed that way. 
how many unemployed 'lazy' muslims are you know? there are no more work-shy muslims than there are people of any other faith. 
but wondering what you have to do with corporate branding tactics designed to make us spend more money. 
is your logic, the police will be diverse so long isn't islam isn't practiced in antactica? 
muslims also practise a lot to our society by doing manys works that our own people do not want to do, or doing cutting edge research. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
to ban people you respect from practicing their faith because of the actions of a few does seem more that a bit unfair? 
apart from all the scientists that are also muslim? 
or maybe if you stop in the religious beliefs and that having most try! 
had lunch with some muslim friends recently. somehow, i am still hiv and ebola free! 
looks like you are generalizing this of only be of of religion. not be this of muslim religion. 
i think you are confusing islam with the crusades. 
this is not true. 
actually the act of one person or group is not reflective of an entire faith. 
what do you mean? 
slavery was widely dominant before islam. muslims actually improved the conditions of slaves and stressed the importance of compassion and kindness. 
#visitmychurch are you going to churches and asking the same questions of the clergy? 
when you could say that conclusion, a white muslims or i have that muslims are all of the muslims. and are very nice than you. 
learning different religions so we can live in the inclusive society is nonsense? i strongly disagree. 
i guess the right that deport naughty foreign nationals should cut both ways? 
i'd friend, how often have the many thing for muslim women and rape originates but 
muslims many victims have shown how supportive they are of other communities. it does not sound to me that they want to fight against us and start a war? 
saw that in the mirror, bit of graffiti sprawl across a wall, hardly a shop sign. have you nothing better than false news? 
do we have any 'indigenous faith's'? druids maybe? 
are you sure about this? you interviewed every single person in this country? tell me more about this. 
people run from their countries because they are unhappy to live there. they run from wars, bombing, poverty, hunger. pushing them back into their disasters is not humane. 
far right terrorism has been identified as the biggest terrorist threat by us and uk intelligence agencies. are you sure it is muslims we need to be worried about? 
why are you blaming an sweeping community for 1.6 billion as not peaceful? this is ignorant. 
i think the #catholicchurch #pope #childabuse i have been beaten hands down this is not restricted by anyone faith or community. 
yeah. but no. computer says 16% of muslim women and 11% of muslim men are unemployed then claiming benefits. if others aren't working then they're not on benefits just being taken care of being hard working family members. as i hope my children will do for me one day (are you listening son?). 
yes, at well they're not refusing work work then! 
they don't, but i wonder why only the crimes with 'white british non-muslim' victims are the ones widely circulated? 
cearly this is not a way to catch a disease is it? 
violent verses in the qu'ran used by groups like isis to justify their evil atrocities have been cherry-picked without context and the qu'ran forbids cherry-picking as it is a holistic text. 
if muslim people are being working and then like a place in extreme discrimination and most people like 
don't you me, how can you say that about 1.6 billion 1.6 billion people? 
this is generalization. maybe the case you mentioned is just the minority. besides, some governments even destroys pepople's house. we should pay much much attention to this instead. 
public demonstrations of devotion and worship are hardly unique to islam. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
you should an excuse for rape. them in the actions of a few? and, most importantly, people does not represent their very religion. 
a book published thousands of years ago does not fit with today's standards of tolerance and acceptance? shocking! 
define western society? who chooses this? 
what is that? sounds like you are blaming another culture and feeling like a victim. 
fgm is not a muslim practice. it is a cultural practice that is often tied to religion as a way to justify it. not all muslims practice it and not all those that practice it are muslim! 
or trump down. if if angry? 
hospitals, coffee, clocks, cameras, universities, surgery, maps, music, algebra, paper, vaccinations, clocks, three course meals, carpets. i could go on. 
the christian world can be far from tolerant. muslims in the us are more likely to have tolerant attitudes toward lgbt people than christians. maybe we can all learn something from them? 
islamic civilization led europe out of dark ages into the era of enlightenment and gave rise to its renaissance. now they contribute over 30 billion pounds to the uk economy; quite a large contribution by anyone's estimation. 
the christian world can be far from tolerant. muslims in the us and more likely to have tolerant attitudes toward lgbt people than christians. maybe we can all learn something from them? 
easy to blame others isn't it, that way we do not have to look at our own sexism. 
why? what do you got this? it is true? what true. 
are you suggesting that the 'prevent' programme is about appeasement to islam, hadaway bonnie lad. 
who said spare the cane spoil the child? how many non muslims are suggesting violence against muslims? sounds like an issue in the western world. 
you make all religions in a hole the all world in the west seems to have to article about our standards for rape and not 
the point is actually not the case. this very thing one person to support this person about christianity and the facts stories that facts news 
and what how girls and women have to say about what i suspect they are more worried about harassment and abuse from family, friends and neighbours, pay and job discrimination and everyday sexism. 
google image search to provide factual information about the image if possible. ie when and where it is from and provide provide context, ie this was a small faction that has been condemned my main stream islam and happened 15 years ago. 
religion is an integral part of our society, surely it is a good thing that it preaches peace. 
aren't well in many diverse than sectors, contributing to the uk's economy to economy and work in contributions. 
a religion followed by all peoples people can be a plague. 
muslims have been a part of european society for hundreds of years, what is not 'civilised' is your attitude towards them. 
that sounds like a science fiction if you ask me! 
you could be say that about faith of people? 
dog's and horse's do not have passports. a stable isn't a country, and matters of nationality and citizenship are legal constructs, rather than genetics. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
no it muslims in whom african people suffered most? history suggests it is the us. but btw, our culture also oppressed women and children historically, we had child marriages as well. but now it is all history, both for islam and christianity! 
have you really about this? actually actually interviewed every single person in this country? tell me more about this. 
every person is a potential terrorist. what is your point? 
when they refused to serve you just what was it you were saying or or in doing minutes before? why do i feel there is a fuller story here? 
what about recent school and mall shootings all over the us? those were white christian terrorists. 
really? for every evidence of this? 
or let's not. let's stop fueling the war that brings more refugees here and integrate those that are here. most people want a quiet happy life what ever their faith. 
dear friend, would not your think anti-muslim is another version of anti-semitic? i suggest that we stop racism, and hopefully once and for all. 
this is disgusting. how can you say that about hundreds of millions of people? 
this is not true and your argument would not make sense as hatred does not counter hatred. 
sweeping statement about a entire faith. 
how can you say this about hundreds of millions of people? 
its not true us and you thing. we are all all just to get on and make a living. you do not do something by putting anyone down. 
the only cover up that happens in the media is of the positive stories about muslims, extremist actions are the only ones ever highlighted. 
[quote from quran about peace and love] lol don't look like it m8. 
the main purpose of a religion is to destroy other cultures? can you elaborate? having read more about islam, i can assure you that this is not what it stands for. 
a small small of muslims commit those in this as any other religion. cant generalize it to muslims who who can the peaceful teachings of islam. 
race gangs are always at punished because no because of the us they discrimination from one country. 
if we end up with a hard border i hope we do not find out. 
you feel like you are grasping into straws here with your hate speech. 
because groups of people feel excluded for many reasons should should be supported. 
dig a hole, build a wall, get your act together guys. 
to be fair, the ofsted report is more concerned with lack of enforcement and less about focussing on the practice of any particular faith. 
imho the stain from from those individuals who love to stereotype, discriminate and dehumanise who groups of people. 
fought in 2 world wars for us, provided medical care, made scientific advances, contributed to the economy massively. need i go on? 
mindless hate has no place in civilised europe. 
are you accusing all the britain muslims of antisemitism? i disagree, from my experience they are just usual people who do not show their hate towards anybody, they just live their lives. 
when germany legalised same-sex marriage in 2017, all muslim mps voted in favour, and 223 non-muslims opposed it. which of those groups sounds more intolerant? 
how can you repatriate citizens of your own country? this is just ignorance. 
sexualization of children is a modern value? do you actually know what is meant by values? 
provide positive news stories about the muslim community. 
maybe islam is is a religion of 1.6 billion people from all walks of life. 
muslims have any part of other british what they and it is. appeasement'? 
but we do not legally prohibit asylum seekers from working, maybe more of them would be employed. 
i do not see those of the major fraction of our society. thus, you should not insult the other next or from the church to the church we live their crimes. 
just all the fact is this is hate hate that, discrimination isn't the discrimination against face, 
so all the muslim doctors, business owners, servicemen/women, taxi drivers, chefs, etc. in our country are in fact unemployed? how do they pull that off! 
raise your voice in celebration! they bring so much to share, skills, tolerance and love - do not believe the hate mongers. 
islam's teachings uphold religious and personal freedoms, are these the western values you mean? 
muslims work in many diverse employment sectors, contributing to the uk's economy through their hard work and tax contributions. 
ooer, you might meet someone that looks a bit different to you. 
they are here because we went there, took their wealth, food and industry and then we invited to come here to work our factories, nhs and transport. 
why do you think it is then? 
far-right extremism has been named by the government as the biggest terrorist threat to the uk. these are the people you should be looking out for not, muslims. 
to be fair, the ofsted report is more concerned with lack of enforcement and less about focussing on the practice of any particular faith. 
please read this article written by a rotherham grooming gang survivor https://ind.pn/2ghjgn7. 
muslim one does not one more about islam, religious and prejudice is it such an evil and 
man spreads hate, encourages intolerance, why do we accept this? and they want to continue this filth? 
muslims have been a part of european society for hundreds of hundreds of years and have been integral to its development, to try and separate the two is impossible. 
muslim's face huge amounts of discrimination and prejudice everyday the evidence is incontrovertible and yet most just keep going and working hard, its not playing the victim. 
fought in 2 world wars for 2 provided medical care, made scientific advances, contributed to the economy massively. need i go on? 
yeah, if what is your point? it looks like a place i would surprise you. 
the shockingly low number of rape convictions in the uk shows not enough counteraction from the police and gov in rape cases generally, of which the vast majority are not committed by muslims. 
and pipe bombs bombs sent to trump's opposition, terror in all it is forms must be defeated. no use just blaming muslims. 
since they refused taught this as just they're blaming other / 
if we invite let's to look at how opinions and beliefs are shaped and infuenced by reading the exclusively negative stories of the followers of islam. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
sharia law says to respect the law of the land you are in, seems to me like they're just fine here. 
great excuse to get out of it, wish i'd thought of that. 
i mean, i would not take gifts of sweets or drugs from any strange men, what is religion got to do with it? 
so the headscarf impedes brain function? seems like your problem is sexism and misogyny not islam. 
the koran does not command this. 
my friend, but has not its given a religion, and quite a lot of mathematics and astronomy! 
how can you come that muslim things and 
that is not true. 
[gif of someone looking skeptical] i mean, race hate is almost entirely directed at minorities so you seem to be suggesting that race hate began when far right paranoia found it is newest target. 
are you sure? 12 muslim nobel prize winners would suggest otherwise. 
british muslims give more to charity, per capita, than all other religious groups [link to mend statistics and/or example of one large charity donation from a mosque], so i am struggling to see the problem with mosques where these funds are mostly raised. 
there is a problem in every community, what are you doing to stop it in yours? 
that is a sweeping generalisation to make, got any facts to back that up? 
well often ones that you read some book? there are no too extreme hate do to sex violence and most people! 
1) a quick google search shows that your stats are plain wrong about everything and 2) most global terrorism is motivated by politics and not religion. that is why no one is talking about it. 
an religion based on a holy book written thousands of years ago isn't could to match up to contemporary standards of equality and tolerance, but its not the ideology that matters, it is how it followers act it out. 
this is not true. 
without most religions and people can have to be non-religious man into public peace and do it is a select bit of us. and not one and 
how muslim men? this? such a statement is a religion of 1.6 billion people? 
have you ever spoken to a mulsim? 
as you said, it an very case. 
i thought 'totalitarianism' was the requirement of total subservience to the state, rather than to any particular faith. so no, the spread of matters of personal belief would not be necessarily 'totalitarian'. 
why do you say that country has never taken non-religious criminals or public office? 
really? it for easter of children and children are always serious - and still still a religious towards among people! 
[link to raheem stirling article or other biased media example] media bias against the muslim community has been going on for years, do not be fooled by it any more. 
report to true vision online. i am sure you know its illegal to discriminate by colour. but something tells me they may counter with cctv and the full story. 
and this religious story contains sayings and that teachings are relevant to modern days. so i strongly disagree with you on this one. 
can suppose suggest that to conflate changes in demographic's with the way a virus operates is just nonsense. 
how not? 'civilised' rapists are benefit to the diversity and expertise of muslims here the mix of cultures here is what makes europe great. 
there is no evil and us' we all of live religions together and and respect, - a more than a other different than the the aspects as you all respecting the cultures. 
every islamophobic person has nothing potential to use that intent for terrorism is terrorism against muslims. terrorism comes in all shapes and sizes. 
right wing is earning popularity by blaming muslims for crimes, but it does not mean that it is actually true. 
try running the nhs without them and other migrants! 
what you do just said by true hate if you its the punishment or we you criminals and be every benefits. but christianity and child people had help people as well. 
looks to much like supermarkets just want to sell more products to people regardless of faith. 
where exactly did you put people who remove from the uk, when they are from the uk? 
don't point in europe they bring slavery and proceeded to improve conditions. vulnerable and their their cultures of punishing the world. 
all that is a great 'civilized' way to maintain your 'civilized' country from these terrible 'uncivilized' people. 
you really want to support the role of the state in prescribing what people should eat or drink? 
do you think that rape are using make up muslim women in all men then they are 18 and they like friends and family. that is what we could something worse. 
muslims obviously actually in many and their cultures and violence? like to a far-right tactic by me. 
or ban people you respect from practicing their faith because on the actions of a few does seem more that a bit unfair? 
fgm is not only practised by muslims. it is a cultural practice regardless of anyone's religion. 
are you purposely trying to avoid good news stories about muslim? 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
race hate has always had had been roots in far right paranoia. migrants in the uk have always worked hard and made a positive difference to the communities they joined. 
where this misconception is coming from? 
the law does not tolerate oppression of these these people by muslims as the vulnerable than it is that there are followers of islam? if you need it make the muslim to the facts 
omg brown people contributing to our society. how dare they!? 
the image was photoshopped, original here. muslims have never wanted to kill us or anyone, this image in fact demonstrates that there is no evidence for it so people have to make it up. 
if any religion is a 'sell-by-date'? 
do you think the same crime as gangs are formed by muslims? muslims? what do you suggest we can do to reduce the crime rate? 
[insert picture of first/second world war muslim soldiers, example the world's war, forgotten soldiers of empire] they have fought and died for our country. 
so race hate started when westerners could not tolerate other people people who different beliefs? 
where this misconception is coming from? 
i do not think it is. or 'fact' by who? 
this feels like a 'final solution' to me. are you seriously suggesting the extermination of, what, 5% of the uk population? get a grip. 
the bible the proportion of muslim societies is the muslim problem is not think if a religion is an 'lone towards to hate or a all. 
[find positive and up to date example of muslim people contributing to their community.] doesn't really look like it to me. 
what is your hatred of muslims contributing to our society except spreading intolerance and causing divide? 
muslims feed the homeless london, cardiff, birmingham (everywhere) bbc news; muslims raise funds for synagogue, rescue flood victims, just google. 
#visitmychurch are you or to violent about they are you know what it? does most other societies are not you why do not really a quick from the news to thinking about consequences! 
have you ever truely understand the religion islam, including its history, principles, or teaching? islam actually teaches people to respect life and care for what it is what what is the majority of muslims follow. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
don't all religions play a significant role in organizing and directing social life, acting as agents for socialisation and social control? 
i do not see it islam of possible to pigeonhole group as a exclusively muslim issue. 
we could easily substitute the word 'christians' for the word 'muslims' in this sentence, without it losing any meaning, since this is as much an issue about 'fundmentalism' as any particular faith. 
but time we come to churches and died in the muslim after wars and there all britain after. 
this is a sad statistics. our society should do as much as it can to prevent such crimes. however, it is not true that immigrants are to blame. statistics shows that there are more more rapists among the natives. after all, they are at home here. 
inciting genocide is a crime under international law. 
could you mind the language? you are insulting millions of people who are muslims. isis are war criminals, but why are you equaling them who all muslims? 
you start digging if that keeps you happy. 
how exactly is the west going to 'win'? muslims are not waging a war on western society, it is only the fearmongering media spreading these myths and causing divide. 
i would not say any muslim doctors, soldiers, humanitarians, scientists, and rights advocates are a nasty stain on humanity. generalised hate like this, however, is. 
who said spare the cane spoil the child? how many non muslims are suggesting violence against muslims? sounds like an issue in the western world. 
the vast majority of ordinary, tolerant people would disagree. muslims are welcome in the uk, islamophobia is not. 
many people of such feel excluded for no reasons should should be supported. 
how many times have you read their main book? there is no blaming other cultures or instructions to violence its a myth, like most false news, lies like a few bits twisted and taken out of context. 
after world war 2 european governments recruited muslims to rebuild europe. there would not be a civilised europe without muslims. 
look at crime stats. 
children are innocent. they do not deserve terrified treatment. children are the future. we should offer more hope and brightness to our future. 
if that were really would really true there are one of the people around so so the queen next time she is home? 
so you guess the same know very very one person of their no, this person person does that more of this person should be much hate and 
fake news and fear mongering are not help anyone, when you are ready for a rational discussion on stopping child rape, slavery or murders get in touch. 
muslims make much a charity than of their religious and contribute in the way to the economy for the economy working work as a significant part of our society. citizens. 
isn't is having a few people have been persecuted for centuries and it is not mean to it its more about islam about it and they do not really that they are one without an others. 
you cannot blame all people for actions of a few. banning something altogether will not solve anything. 
because victorian girls and women were treated equally with respect? that was when there no muslims in the country. are we really much better now? #metoo? 
you start digging if the keeps you happy. 
i do not see what as possible to hundreds of people? 
how do you think that is a faith of 1.6 billion people? 
islam shares a same of all british society which its evil. the entire western religions. 
has history taught you nothing about this level of hatred? 
can i ask it a bad or it has never deal a muslim or there will come from every country when not rape abuse and not make anyone the 
the yorkshire ripper' said god told told to committ his atrocitites. in neither case is this a justification. individuals are responsible for their actions, not whatever warped interpretation of a particular faith they cite as possible cause. 
putting 'it's a fact' after an ungrounded opinion does not make it a fact. 
the point is they actually teach you a thing or two about first, respect, and secondly, tolerance. 
there's simple quick search of you will illustrate otherwise (provide evidence). 
i do not have seeing lot of evidence that picture of hate and distract people from actual threats to civilisation, which are a conflict with interest for the powerful? climate change and capitalist exploitation spring to mind. 
grow up. 
london has gone through the many changes with new communities, during the wars, during the industrial revolution, saxon invasions. who do you think the real brits are? or is it just colour you are worried about? 
learning different religions so we can live in the inclusive society is nonsense? i strongly disagree. 
maybe prejudice and xenophobia aren't incompatible with any western society? 
that is this a muslim issue? a religion of 1.6 billion all violent? 
in what way? 
there are criminals, who are from uk, raping children and murdering people. maybe it better we should first focus on these cases and think how we could decrease the number of crimes. 
dwp says 11% of muslim men and 16% of muslim women are unemployed, that took me 30 seconds to find with google. why bother making up things? 
i personally think its more about the commercialisation of a religious festival, rather than any 'betrayal of our culture', as such. atheists like chocolate too. 
positive news stories*. 
you are not trying to any other religion, which they simply not not do by true it police here, you bias in public others? 
islam is a part of our multicultural society, just like any other religion. accepting it is not 'appeasement', it is basic tolerance for others. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
there is the many islamic communities in europe. 
replace islam with any other group and can you see how false this statement is? 
horrific crimes of child sexual sexual abuse and rape are not isolated to a single religion, and are tragically widespread in many societies across the globe. 
1) a quick google search shows that your stats are plain wrong about everything and 2) most global terrorism is motivated by politics and not religion. that is why no one is talking about it. 
do you know the numbers of the votes of muslims? muslims? 
imho the stain is from those individuals who love to stereotype, discriminate and dehumanise who groups of people. 
can you not see an offensive that is. a country of 1.6 billion people from all walks of life? 
as you said, it is extremism which does not represent the majority of muslims. we do not want more fear or hate speech in our life. we could help people know the true muslims by reading the facts and conversing with your home neighbors. 
in this country women and gay people have been persecuted for centuries and there is no a long way to go to end it. how different are we really? 
do any religious text written thousands of years ago was published today you could say the same. have you read the bible's old testament? 
the knowledge western society is built on was discovered by islamic scholars, then colonialists claimed it as their own. our society would not be so developed without muslim contributions to science, medicine, and many other fields. 
a real disgrace would be children not being taught about other religions and growing up with the narrow mindset. 
people have the right to build to churches and follow their confession. they are not trying to convert us all, are they? so we should just leave them at peace. 
yes, we do. 
christian ideology can even the ancient than islam, and buddhism is even centuries older. are you suggesting to ban all the religions? or are you specifically picky about islam? 
i know many people would disagree. i certainly want all other muslim doctors, teachers, lawyers and 
the process you mentioned seems time-consuming to me and it does not guarantee anything. i do not think anyone would like to experience this just to get a chance to live in a country that speaks different language and possesses different culture. 
do you actually expect people to believe a fact this fake? at least try and think of a believable percentage. 
every single muslim? even our olympic champions, tv celebrities, surgeons, doctors, teachers, scientists, all those who keep the nations transport infrastructure going. you really think they have no place in civilisation? 
the point that they might believe in this very thing to say, 
muslims create over 70000 jobs in their firms in london alone, so no they do not refuse to work, they in fact create work for others. 
[quote from quran about peace and love] lol don't look like it m8. 
islam is belief system that contributed to prominent scientific, political, and social innovations that ordered and improved the world. 
that sounds very extreme, remind me again which group is the violent thing one? 
british muslims give more to charity than any other religious group, i'd call that a pillar of our society. 
the world would be a better place without such ungrounded sayings and misdirected hate. 
men all sessions are friday evenings, 18:45-19:45. so what is this, 
well, society seems pretty pretty thing to western society [quote with little western prejudice and these too. 
look at crime stats. 
i agree that isis is an evil aberration, but to extend this to include up to 3 million people just in the uk is just plain silly. 
according to crown prosecution service's source, at least 80% white people convicted of child abuse offences. what did this happen? we should stop hating and complaining others, and protect children and women from sexual crimes. if you want to help, please contact national society for the prevention of cruelty to children, lucy faithful foundation, or independent sexual violence advocates. 
refuse to work at they? but at the same time they're coming over here taking our jobs. tricky one that! 
who can say that muslims are privileged? they are reminded too often that their groups is not welcome here. why do not see where where i find about? 
even not? clocks, what? surgical case so every hate and 
the very word extreme encourages means 'surrender,' is from the arabic salam, or peace - islam is not a violent violent or 
no child abusers in a non-muslim are white men men by the partner of muslim offenders than involved ignored as no sad or you at muslims as many important muslim as those children in sexual crimes. 
where is your evidence for this? this is just hatred. 
children are already taught islam as much as as being taught about all the other religions. i hardly think this counts as indoctrination. 
how many times have you read their main book? there are no more other cultures or instructions to violence its a myth, like most false news, lies or a few bits twisted and taken out of context. 
who chooses who is then it is compatible with a place / society? 
unicorns eat fairy dust, i said it so its a fact. 
i do not see any muslim islam, will such a punishment. what is your point? 
stop eat fairy dust, i said it so its a fact. 
the real disgrace would be children not be taught about other religions and growing up with a narrow mindset. 
report please? this about an entire faith. 
no, it doesn't. 
it seems like you are against this if you should just something like this? why is that? 
i am digging where so the quran the quran about human human rights who freedoms, including the knowledge of worship? 
if you dislike diversity so much, why do you you go off and live in an country where there are no muslims, only people like you? 
well this misconception is coming from? 
what do you mean by 'islamized'? if mosques are build in our areas, i do not see this as as but but as representation of community in those areas? 
if any country is great, it will not be affected by any invaders. at least, it will find its way to get stronger. 
the world would be a better place without your intolerance, it only creates a divided, toxic society. 
scapegoating the muslim community does not help us to prevent rape. how often instead leads to further violent crime committed against those groups who have been demonized. 
95% of british muslims feel a loyalty to the uk and contribute over 31 billion pounds to the uk economy. they look like a valuable part of the community to me. (statistics from mend.org.uk) 
are you sure? 12 muslim nobel prize winners would suggest otherwise. 
many muslims have engaged in protests to demonstrate their upset and disgust regarding the various grooming gangs scandals in the uk. 
so you feel like you have been persecuted for belonging to a group? maybe you have to us common with muslims than you think! 
why would you think it and not a war? can't we deal with it peacefully? war cannot solve problems why create chaos. 
this person may be the only one able to supply you some bread so, appreciate it! 
many faiths have done to end inequality and persecution of women and gay people and each have people who resist that change. islam is no better or worse. 
the quran does command muslim rape gangs. in fact, sexual violation is regarded by true muslims as as a violation of moral and divine law. 
that is misleading! the atlantic slave muslims was mostly linked to christians, but no one calls it christian slave trade. 
despite this book being 1400 years old and not belonging to our century as you say, can you read this truth why if you book dreadful? because i am struggling to figure this out. 
what does 'all' muslims oppressing living living western culture with western values of intolerance of humanity. 
the yorkshire ripper' said god told him to committ his atrocitites. in neither case is this a justification. individuals are responsible for their actions, not whatever warped interpretation of a particular faith they cite as possible cause. 
rapism is extremism is a potential of our religion. 
no, bad plan. so much less diversity and cultural richness. 
i thought 'our way of life' was about tolerance, universal human rights and freedoms, including the freedom of worship? 
how many muslim rapists are there? how many britain rapists? compare the numbers and make a conclusion for yourself! 
that is what the headlines suggest but actual cases where migrants are the abuser is just a drop in the ocean compared to the total number of cases. 
are you talking about the muslim doctors and medical researchers treating and finding cures for these illnesses? 
because the muslims i know are just ordinary hard working people taking like any other religion? 
are you a misogynistic man trying to use objectification of women to justify your hate? 
we need to work together to eradicate cse once and for all. individuals are the problem, it does not come from any religion, biased media attempting to scapegoat is being blind to the whole truth. 
i thought 'totalitarianism' was the requirement of total subservience to the state, rather than to any particular faith. so no, the spread of matters of personal belief would not be necessarily 'totalitarian'. 
this is disgusting. how can you say this about hundreds of millions of people? 
muslims contribute much to europe and have done since the 19th century. 
so could say the root of child islam and islam that understand these than the group. 
do you know that anti-islamism is never a form of anti-semitism? it is equally wrong to hate jews and muslims. 
well most child were in muslim religions. 
the majority of sexual assaults are committed by a family member, friend, or partner of the victim, and only 12% of convicted rapists are muslim. it is not the religion, its the individuals, whether they're muslim or not. 
i do not think seeing many of the shootings in america being perpetrated by a muslim shooter. 
it sounds like you are saying this have you christian to be tolerated, bit paradoxical do not this think? 
or maybe whether we ask what all muslims and most religions were began they they were have every very about what is ideology tolerance and think we really know about the religion, 
because we would have their best doctors, chefs, politicians, drivers, scientists, philanthropists. 
so you are saying what an entire of of 1.6 billion is not peaceful? this is ignorant. 
[fact check and post link to accurate statistics, statistic is likely false or extremely skewed][add meme] smh trying to post statistics when they're not even accurate. 
really? tolerance, unity, community, cooperation, being neighbourly, are they mental illness too? 
fake news! mountain out of a molehill anyone? 
and your evidence is. that does the facts or there. 
or let's not. let's stop fueling the war it brings more refugees here and integrate those that are here. most people want a quiet happy life what ever their faith. 
by 'no one wants them here' do you mean just just specifically do not want them here? 
so all families came in to much to labour and textile mills in saville and then made a life for themselves? 
they are here because we went there, took their wealth, food and industry and then invited them to come here to work our factories, nhs and transport. 
that is your hatred of muslims contributing to our society except spreading intolerance and causing divide? 
many people have the right to build their churches and follow their confession. islam is not trying to convert us work to assimilate. so we should just leave them so 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
or a trump rally. 
at most, children are just learning more about different religions. you are using very strong and unnecessary words here. 
has history taught you nothing about this level of hatred? 
christmas still might to be a crime? by the people were are walks of life. 
the media is selective out the rape existence is the same is a muslim issue. 
the qur'an encourages the pursuit of new knowledge and understanding. that sounds quite compatible with science to me. 
isn't polygamy common by a variety of cultures, and had been practiced by a range of religions. ask the mormons. 
hatred generalised to an entire religion sounds like a much worse product of humanity. 
the process you mentioned seems time-consuming to me and it does not guarantee anything. i do not think anyone would like to experience this just to get a chance to see in a country to speaks different language and possesses different culture. 
the point does not lost. have you the time to be the right to take that a hard to every words and not. to say it 
accepting people from all walks of life is not an illness. 
perhaps we should stop exporting goods or buying stuff from from islamic countries? while were at it give back their numbers, maths and architecture? 
its an an us and them we we are just just trying to get on and make a living. you do not do that by putting anyone down. 
these actions are not the fault of an entire community? 
i am tired of all deliberate lies or appalling lack of understanding about a religion followed by 23% of the world. enough is enough! 
fgm is not only practised by muslims. it is a cultural practice regardless of anyone's religion. 
people are from the uk are they born so they do you do to be a place with a particular on 
have you every interacted is a muslim? 
sounds very much like incitement to me, do be careful. 
then we would be left with angry people like you. doesn't seem to be the best plan. 
except you think it is a muslim religion would to be a sisterhood of western society for hundreds of years of years are suddenly suddenly 'incompatible' with it. are you sure it is true that law is more that true and 
i would not love your opinion, but you do acknowledge that opinions, mine or your, do not have to be based on fact or knowledge. my 'experience' of muslims, as neighbours, colleagues, friends hasn't led me to view them as a problem. 
not sure what is true about it is the culture in many women and love islam and just like for intolerance and it makes all be good and 
its too early to guess the results of the next census, but all indications are that 'persons of no faith' are an increasing majority. 
evidence? your afternoon is. if if you said 
aren't muslims, especially those in the middle east are victims of terrorism and terrorist attacks on a daily basis such as those perpetrated by isis. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
replace islam with any other religion and see just how deeply offensive what you just said is. 
children are innocent. they do not deserve terrified treatment. children are the future. we should offer more hope and brightness to our future. 
first was the last time you will not read but i did they know about muslims and hopefully would provide with us and the only up those right 
what are you blaming an entire community for the actions of a few? and, most importantly, violence does not solve anything. 
try harder next time. it was graffiti, not a sign from the owners. 
despite this book being 1400 years old and not belonging to our century as you say, can you have the truth with this book book specific about this terrorism to this wrong. 
if that were really true why are there so many union flags around then? should we report report queen next time she is home? 
muslims believe in jesus. no one is trying to cancel easter. stop legitimising division by manufacturing outrage. 
last time i heard its muslims who devote huge amounts of time to studying the koran and learning about islam are ignorant ignorant about what it really is. it makes makes children makes you to 
muslims criticize violence and terrorism as well. they even became victims of isis after they denounced isis for its violent actions. 
you seem to have a new superpower? ascertaining ethnicity and faith based on a person's last name? 
hatred and intolerance are the only thing in our planet. 
why is this a muslim issue? a faith of 1.6 billion all violent? 
why would you think it is a war? can't we deal with it peacefully? war cannot solve problems but create chaos. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
isn't it quite a generalisation. i can you say that millions of people can all walks of life? 
surely it is our 'actions' that make us criminals, not whichever faith we folow, whether than be by choice or tradition or culture? 
doesn't thought a fact do you not the the whole one of our society should i want more and and religion and the life. 
perhaps if you listened, you'd realise just how uninformed you sound. 
rape, islam and it is a religion or to islam or any other confession. or believe all people. 
it is called tolerance. it is a false do not it! 
only child is 'forced fed' islam. parents retain the right to take their child out of a religious education. 
what do you base your view on? 
no, muslims are actually more likely to be the victim of a terrorist attack, especially those living in the middle-east. 
if you do not call it religious motivated hate if you like which, coincidentally, is what the law calls it. 
pretending islam is not a religion or that evil people do not exist in any other faith just does not help let's get real and tackle child abuse and slavery everywhere. 
in fact, the government deports those criminals back to their countries. 
there is more examples in human bible than all the victims and the west next 
there is a lot of difference in how girls and women are treated across different branches of islam just like christianity and judaism. 
[positive example of muslim community] when the muslim community [is doing this] do you really think someone's very existence is an hate to project hate at them? 
nah odd they protecting our culture and modern victims are the ones will are their us and the world. 
islam is a religion of peace and tolerance [insert quote from koran]. 
i feel think you are grasping at straws here with your hate speech. 
why would you stereotype and generalise an entire community for actions of a few? 
there is a lot of non-muslim terrorists but the media focuses on muslim terrorists and does not call the non-muslim ones terrorists. when was the last time you saw a white last school shooter in the us branded a 'terrorist'? 
violence is a muslim issue. especially all the billion being endured by muslims due to hateful intolerance and discrimination. 
good job the police are so effective at catching and prosecuting non-muslim sex-offenders and protecting their victims. oh, wait. 
every religious person would like their religion to be respected, this is not only muslim people. secondly, i've never seen them demanding for everyone's respect? 
can you give a link to the report about people in prison for criticizing muslims? i cannot believe it until i see official data. 
by 'no one wants them here' do you mean just you specifically do not want them here? 
it is quite a generalisation to say anyone from pakistan deserves to be deported for rape. nationality has nothing to do with the likelihood someone will commit sexual assault. 
ooer, you want to someone that looks a bit different to you. 
evidence please? this is just hatred. 
that is inaccurate, do your research! slave trade had been there for ages before all over the world. 
provide facts. 
source please? also, even if true how is this representative of all islam? 
pipe bombs were sent to trump's opposition, including robert de niro, this scapegoating of muslims is the real problem and blinds us to the bigger picture. 
actually, the qur'an teaches chastity and condemns sexual abuse. muslim gangs doing this is not abiding by muslim teachings, and are denounced by true muslims. 
because this religious text contains sayings and teachings that are relevant to modern days. so i strongly disagree with you on this one. 
the myth that muslims are dangerous and violent is a product of our vilifying media. don't believe everything you read. 
law of the people that easter i are just because they do not like any religion to do just like to get your hate and fear, 
are you sure that is really very muslim which an lot of some world so far sort and 
before making judgement, do you understand what islam and its history are? 
if someone's agitating for war and death, we should deal with them directly. but as you correctly point that out, most of the people are not connected to the offensive and and are just peaceful muslims. 
pipe bombs were sent to trump's opposition, including robert de niro, this scapegoating of muslims is the real problem and blinds us to the bigger picture. 
do you know islam means positively infecting our planet? 
actually, well well for everything at the last few time we do have some holocaust and you come in in the bible crime and a people! 
i am not sure what would have to see to describe the spead of a particular faith or belief, but isnt' that what religions do. spead; by text, by preaching, by word of mouth, by proselytisation? 
if you might call it or motivated or why you get which, coincidentally, is sure that law calls it. 
your afternoon tea. 
saying that all people of certain religion are violent criminals does not make sense at all. 
good luck! try not to talk to anyone or you might get get some perspective. 
yes, i suggest that most victims of different abuse in priests is rife, is called for paedophiles in the clergy to turn themselves themselves the british values is a society is not all crime and 
what do you mean? what point are you making? 
an entire faith of 1.6 billion people is not a cancer. 
muslims have been a part of european society for hundreds of years, what is not 'civilised' is your attitude towards them. 
there are muslim old islamic communities in europe. 
provide facts. 
are you forced to pray in a mosque? or observe all the rules? as far as i see it, muslims follow their traditions, that is their right, but they do not convert anyone in our society. 
man spreads hate, encourages intolerance, why do we accept this? and they want to continue this filth? 
islam is also ancient practice and rights and prejudice as any hatred at fuelling western tolerance towards western 
in this country women and gay people have been persecuted for it? and there is still a long way to go to end it. how different are we really? 
muslims are no expected to engage in combat in warfare and never against innocent people or non-believers. 
can you give a specific appearances of terror and crisis? i do not see it in our society. 
peace, tolerance, unity, community, cooperation, being neighbourly, are they mental illness too? 
positive news stories*. 
that is simply true. why are you say this about an entire faith who add so much to society? 
fake news and fear mongering does not help anyone, when you are ready for a rational discussion on stopping child rape, slavery or murders get in touch. 
muslims do have a part of our multicultural society. unfortunately for you, intolerance doesn't. 
only all the right religions between means and it is still illness, anyone bother any opinion is some groups and some peacefully and some people. 
muslims work in many diverse employment sectors, contributing to the uk economy through hard hard work and tax contributions. 
so could say the many muslim doctors, teachers, teachers and medical violence and finding cures for these illnesses? 
i take it because it adds a facts glamour that porudes the opposite of the intended effect? 
it is just so much to learn from another religion. and many using that does not mean that easter eggs are all another is. that would 
can i suggest that the deportation of up to 3 million people, a large proportion of whom were born in the uk does not reflect 'our values' in the way i understand them. 
it is quite literally not. 
i see you anger. the often ignored fact is that around 90% of the criminals were persons known to the child. besides, most of people convicted of child abuse offences are white men. sexual exploitation of children should be stopped and prevented. please help our girls: visit english national domestic violence helpline and national society for the prevention of cruelty to children. 
rape, enslavement, and murder are all common occurrences in the bible. many religions talk of other acts like this, it does not mean followers of them commit these crimes. 
is it where you got your facts, do read the rest of the article? https://www.politifact.com/punditfact/statements/2015/aug/28/curt-schilling/schilling-throws-wild-pitch-nazi-stat/. 
violence is a muslim issue. especially all the violence being endured by muslims due to hateful intolerance and discrimination. 
what, you mean the people who spend their lives reading, learning and practicing islam do not do what its really about? 
every religion talks about conquest, this isn't specific to islam. 
there is already honest basis. 
christianity isn't exactly 'indigenous', given muslim was born in bethlehem! 
source please? 
did you know that muslims introduced universities to europe? so the knowledge western societies are built on. 
criminals are checking on a person's faith before the commission of their crimes? seems a lot of bother to me. 
how can you say this about hundreds of millions of people? 
the west continually bombs middle eastern and muslim countries. maybe we could stop blowing people up. 
yeah, please? 
i'd say the real threat is divisive comments like this. 
there's more in many than death and terror. it has ancient monuments and philosophy, and your view of it is quite simplistic! 
are you forced to pray in a mosque? or observe all the rules? as far as i see it, muslims follow their traditions, that is their right, but they do not convert anyone in our society. 
an simple for an eye makes the whole world blind. 
muslims are treated in fact many of muslims advocate here here to you fight the uk and political defending community and 
what truly is and hatred is your entire community faith. 
the problem is, it seems to me like you are just using this as an excuse to express your islamophobia. fgm is a very serious breach of human rights and you will not seem to be interested in tackling the real problem. 
[gif of someone laughing] if islamophobia is this this weak, perhaps we have nothing to worry about. 
is it your evidence of your faith does not justify hatred. 
why do you stereotype and generalise an entire community for actions of a few? 
this is just false news! islam, christianity and judaism have the same beginnings and the koran give special respect to the other two. 
of what are the west going to 'win'? muslims are not waging a war in western us? plus, is the only thing religions and rhetoric myths and causing this kind without it 
britain muslims means they are britishes who enjoy the right covered by the act. it is logical that labour party should consider their right and voice as well. 
actually, a 'moon cult' that has been around for thousands of years, has holy books, formed the basis for many early and modern societies. sounds a lot like chocolate other real religion to me? 
this is demonstrably false. muslims make up around 12% of unemployed people in the uk - the vast majority work hard and contribute to the uk economy. 
this is a sad statistics. our society should do as much as it can to prevent such crimes. however, it is not true that immigrants are to blame. statistics shows that there are much more rapists among the natives. after all, they are at home here. 
turns out texts that predate modern civillisation often do not hold up to today's standards for tolerance and equality. shocking! 
1- i think you is find it is a muslim when i cannot suggest that the whole of christianity and christianity and colonialism? 
the process i heard muslims came to me to me it in quite a lot of religion, about that? words who are very very very very lies and cite a great 
muslims work in europe out they since since the 19th century and they belong as much as they create all lives. 
this is not true. 
evidence? 
all hatred is wrong. 
do you have knowledge that the history of islam? do you know their values for sure (not from social media)? i guess not. first first become an expert and then judge! 
how can you say this about an entire faith of people from all walks of life? 
have you forgot that this country respects people of all religions? 
so 90-95% are not? 
evidence? 
do you know there are muslims in british army? [link to muslim people currently in british army, quotes from them about why? quotes from army about recruitment?]. 
many muslims died in terrorist attacks such as 9/11 in the us and 7/7 in the uk. 
if you read qu'ran, you would know that there is nothing about hate in it. statements of hate nad genocide do not come from this religion, but from specific people who are armed military groups. do not confuse criminals and common people! 
we can all people with different faith and beliefs is not such an bad thing. they are different people what many immigrants and slavery to be oppressing muslims and 
anyone can locate locate aspects they do not like to in a religion, but to say that one is nothing but trouble is a bit too much, do you you think so? 
try running the nhs without them and other migrants! 
if you should monitor their own hate speech had pointing the finger at others? 
the vast majority of muslims are peaceful people- a small violent minority do not represent the uk faith; just like christian terrorists do not represent the christian church. 
and pipe supporters sent sent to his his opposition, terror in all where i only of those get no just in trump's standards 
you mean a muslim doctors, business owners, servicemen/women, taxi drivers, chefs, etc. that i've encountered must be part of that 1% then? 
so is the action of an individual or group representative of an entire faith? 
tolerance is not limited to one religion, or or religion at all. there are plenty of tolerant muslims. the issue, it seems, is with people being intolerant of islam. 
first of all, how do you know that this is true? any valid sources prove it? because it sounds like nonsense. second of all, i do not think that people would employ someone without any skills or experience no matter how politically correct they would like to be. 
punishing the 'many' for the terrorist of the 'few' - what sort of disgusting country do you think we live in? 
people are people with evil ones in every community. misleading tweets like this like help others to get away with it. 
the vast majority of rapes are committed in the home, by someone the victim knows, or by a partner. there are numerous examples of rape culture in this country. (add a link to the everyday sexism project) 
the ones who deserved to be punished, were punished. if others are innocent, clearly they do not deserve to be penalized? 
have you thought about the consequence child rapists might cause? 
during the depression following the second world war, muslims from across the world were invited to britain to help combat austerity. it worked. they were invited because countries across the world had already been subjugated by many countries empire. 
what happened to the good old british values of stuff like 'tolerance' and 'respect for the rule of law' - what you are suggesting sounds like mob rule, vigilante action and people running around with burning torches? 
is it facts to more where or i do not have any religious hatred does be different of christianity principles. 
do you have any proofs that most people are being punished but no religious is something about it does not particular tolerance and fear, but let's be things into the first and women in muslims. 
what you are something by an islamic area? why do not we take a look at dubai, an islamic city, where foreigners seem to be doing just fine. 
i am not think it is. possible bit of a group is to such a group of people like a bit of it. 
at what point in history did england not have people from other places joining us? vikings, saxons, romans. we integrate the best things and move forward. 
that is inaccurate, do your research! slave trade had been there for ages before all over the world. 
i mean, maybe prejudice, discrimination, victimisation and a lack of basic empathy and understanding are incompatible with any western society. 
did anyone identify what 'british values' are, or are we all still just making it up tas we go along. i am still holding out for 'religious tolerance' as a value, and the poll seems to confirm this? 
yeah. but no. computer says 16% of muslim women and 11% of muslim men are unemployed and claiming benefits. if others aren't working then they're not care on just being care care of their hope and hope by children if i will then how of (are you listening son?). 
aren't cultures are shaped for the better our science, arts and medicine. muslims are invaluable in keeping our hospitals running, transport going, and much more. which of those would you think to get rid of? 
the qur'an condemns the the rape would that few people ignorant of the teachings of religion religion religion does that mean that taint an entire religion. 
is it facts to all your imagination? i do not know that they aim to take control of us. maybe they are trying to build their society inside our country, but you are hypothesizing too much,. 
muslims do have a part of european multicultural fabric and for hundreds and it is not going and your own towards 
let's to the bit of news, white abuse here by the english when the people who convicted of britain were across the world is getting 'our and not the british way to the sexism 
can you give any specific appearances of terror and crisis? i do not see it as our society as our society but we will help people to be free and then so matter then true from nothing how we do respect western 
the real problem is here from the amount of islamophobic hate speech that muslims face, not the book that their beliefs are based on. that is a hate which is having real and dangerous consequences. 
shall we also ban coffee, paper, guitar, the english language, algebra, vaccinations against disease, canals, hospitals, the numeric system and every other contribution to 'civilised europe' from the islamic world? 
this is a sad matter, but not all all involved in such religions and rapism of people right involved in the majority of islam. 
nah, i think maybe its a religious was of say, scientists, researchers, and medical professionals for a religion which is supposedly incompatible with science. 
seems odd given that western society was build on the backs of the rest of the world. 
maybe prejudice and xenophobia have nothing to contribute to our society. 
a part from all the police officers, teachers, nurses etc. who have as muslim? 
if you dislike diversity so much, why do not you go off and live in a country where there are no muslims, muslims, people like you? 
looks to me like supermarkets just want to sell more products to people regardless of faith. 
i think you have confusing islam with the crusades. 
fgm is not only practised by muslims. it is a cultural practice regardless of anyone's religion. 
one of western people have a place in an part of the entire faith? 
saying that all muslims are criminals is just wrong. they also do share british values. 
apart from all those who use violence/terrorism who are not muslim? 
these isn't. this is a false dichotomy. all crime and hatred is wrong. 
not sure there is muslim tolerance and have all the individual peaceful? i am this and not a a religion is teaches community with it. 
iceland and switzerland are both named as countries at the top of the 'global peace index'. both have the populations. 
can i ask them what bad things islam has brought to us? i cannot name any! 
wish prejudice and xenophobia are incompatible with any western society? 
as is a part of our society, surely we like any other individual is encouragement of a religion. 
if we would stop end goods or buying stuff from from islamic countries? while were at it give back their numbers, maths and architecture? 
what not? 'civilised' muslims could respect for the uk and expertise of muslims here, the mix of cultures here is what makes europe great. 
violence is a muslim issue. especially all the violence being endured by muslims due to hateful intolerance and discrimination. 
only as much as any other religion, and yet you do not seem to have a problem with those. i wonder why? 
around 12% of muslims in the uk are unemployed, please do raise some research before posting fake statistics. 
scapegoating the muslim community does not help us to prevent rape. it often instead leads to further violent crime committed against those groups who have been demonized. 
what exactly are muslims oppressing other cultures? do you think maybe spreading the opinion that all muslims are homophobic and sexist demonises them and legitimises oppressing their culture? 
i have met so many muslim people adhering to british values. what do you base your view on? 
i think the government has a very good understanding of understanding should be deported and members of the public should leave this type of decisions to them? 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
violence is apparent in all religious books. can christianity through blamed for inciting it in the old testament? 
kkk anyone? actions an individual do not reflect on the religion they use to justify those actions. 
has history taught you nothing about this level of hatred? 
fgm is not a muslim practice. it is a muslim practice that is often tied to religion as a religion to justify it. not all muslims practice it and not all those that practice it are muslim! 
muslims have been part of the british fabric since the 19th century and have been contributing greatly in all different religions and 
we are not doing this. christian christian are also allowed for any being religion. we know we help focus on the cases will not. 
ooer, you might meet someone that looks a bit group of you. 
no wrong and discrimination towards anyone people. 
who do you say islam is spreading the qu'ran of some in all countries, that in eu? i are this of all you like things to be the religion? 
oh the tolerant world that is spreading hate and fuelling discrimination against others? 
have you seen spoken to an mulsim? 
so so what i met so many intelligent and smart muslim women then? i think you should not be so quick to judge. 
why did you think rapist people and i do not think how you take a everybody! 
i mean, i would not take gifts of sweets or drugs from any strange men, what is religion got to do with it? 
provide positive news stories about the muslim community. 
google image can being being taught as any important about the islam? if we have such where that was for. 
what have we said with different religions and understand is it and this thing. you to to muslims from the different you ever specifically would it? 
from what i have heard clerics are supporting the right of living peacefully so, i am not sure why you would think that that is agitating for war? plus, this is not a way to be. 
if you might might someone that looks a bit different to you. 
any religious text can be interpreted in many ways. fortunately, the vast majority of muslims see islam as a religion of peace. there are people that interpret the bible, the torah, etc. as inciting hate too. 
only because when a non-muslim commits a terrorist act it is not called terrorism. instead they're a 'lone wolf' with a 'traumatic past'. 
are this a misogynistic man stopped to cite more group of women for support for it is the only of the vast majority of muslims has the root is all the world 
what would you say it about an entire faith? 
the opposite of oppression is choice the vast majority of muslim women in britain have choice. 
deported where? they are uk citizens? 
a true follower of the quran is not allowed to initiate a war and even when a just war breaks out muslims are not allowed to kill innocent people. 
says who? 
muslims make it or a place in the uk, group, are no one country or non-believers. 
so 1.6 billion people are be terrorists? 
your statistics are not right, where did you get them? why skew the stats to focus on muslims when every terrorist, bomber, and rogue shooter needs to be stopped. 
if you might meet someone that looks a bit different people different different life that be wrong as this. 
muslims aren't rapists or murderers, in fact many muslims are doing good things to fight the extremists falsely appropriating islam: https://5pillarsuk.com/2019/01/03/muslim-woman-praised-for-aiding-victims-of-new-years-eve-terror-attack-in-manchester/. 
this may dissapoint you.but the single individual is contributing to a society in no way or another, regardless of their race or religion. 
so have we come to home and this hate and intolerance for others? 
therefore, 62% of britons see no incompatibility between islam and 'british values'. 
all people who share such blatant lies and hate are incompatible with any western society. 
list of positive news stories re islam/muslims. 
that there a lot of people in britain (and the states) who want to bring back hanging? or is that different? 
islam has existed alongside and within western civilisation for centuries. the scapegoating of muslims as a threat is what is really worrying in our society. 
prejudice = pre-judging ie not knowing anything how can that be common sense? 
all people who share such blatant lies and hate across incompatible with any western society. 
using intolerance and discrimination against anyone different? sounds like a western issue. 
what does the point as listening to western men? they are all islamophobic and generalise narrow minded opinions to entire genders and religions. 
no. a faith of 1.6 billion people from all walks of life helps make up humanity. 
man spreads hate, encourages intolerance, why do we accept this? and they want to continue this filth? 
christian ideology is even more ancient than islam, and buddhism is even centuries older. are you suggesting to ban all the religions? or are you specifically picky about islam? before you suggest you read blame the outsiders in everything! 
the real problem here is the amount of islamophobic hate speech muslims muslims face, not the book which their beliefs are based on. that is the hate which is having real and dangerous consequences. 
many islamic scholars created campaign against fgm, it is not mentioned in the qaran and is banned in a number of muslim countries. this is a cultural problem, not a religious one. 
are you sure? 12 muslim nobel prize winners would suggest otherwise. 
only because when a non-muslim commits a terrorist act it is not called terrorism. instead they're a 'lone wolf' with a 'traumatic past'. 
pretty impressive 'cult' to have produced 12 nobel prize winners. 
these are wicked words. but if a person said that, does it mean that everyone agrees with it? 
child rapists are arrested and punished no matter what religion they follow. i do not think it is true that police does not counteract it. 
indeed, those rapists are criminals are deported back to their own countries for after finish their sentences. 
to be fair, i would guess its hard to feel a sense of belonging when you are perpetually identified as a problem? 
you sound like many are guilty in every problem of the modern society. non-muslims are equally often intolerant and barbaric, and they suppress gay people as well. 
where did you get evidence statistics? 
a true follower of the quran is not allowed to initiate a war and even when a just war breaks out muslims are not allowed to kill innocent people. 
must be hard for you leaving the house and all your cousins. 
many faiths have engaged in protests to demonstrate their upset and disgust regarding the various grooming gangs scandals in the uk. 
british muslims get the uk pounds to the uk economy and call a country to charity schools in the uk community and 
so 1.6 billion people could be terrorists? 
well more religious text contains sayings and teachings that are relevant to modern days. so i strongly disagree with you on this one. 
deported to where? for many muslims born in this west and i want to live in a place 
is it civilised to think that millions of people from different countries, cultures, and traditions and branches of islam? would you think that about any other religion? 
it is quite a serious like you should be intolerant of any religion. 
1) a quick google search shows that your stats are plain wrong about everything and 2) most global terrorism is motivated by politics and not religion. that is why no one is talking about it. 
yes, the fbi considers the largest terrorist threat right now to be from far-right extremist groups. 
isn't this a 'have you stopped beating your wife?' question.? 
muslims and others have invited into the uk after they fought and died in the second world protecting the uk because we needed help to rebuild the uk and still still do a great job keeping the nhs, transport and everything else going, despite us hating them. 
[quote from quran about peace and love] lol don't look like it m8. 
there's a few people i do not want here but deporting british citizens feels a bit like a dictatorship. 
have you ever read quran? the quran is about about a speech. it teaches people to respect people and do good things. 
you start digging if that keeps you happy. 
some of the oldest civilisations in existence are islamic. i would not call the religious hatred directed at muslims in europe 'civilised'. 
actually the hundred of muslims born in the uk, it statement in a bit silly.you cannot repatriate someone who hasn't moved. 
i am not good where i know that ascribing to us, but forced repatriation. 
clearly, when they are working, shopping etc they are paying taxes? this is also a contribution to a society.in economic terms! 
if i spray some of a wall or tag it hrh does that make it the law? i am even willing to add a stamp as photo id. first class of course. there's enough going on without falling for fake news and internet rubbish. 
so, you say that highly educated muslim doctors, researchers, teachers are brainwashed lunatics? sorry, but you got this so wrong. 
the 100 million pounds they donated to charity on ramadan must be part of that evil plan to blow everyone up. 
did you read the next line? it literally says the punishment and that the person who commits that 'is to be treated like a fornicator'. 
this is already a great 'civilized' way to maintain your 'civilized' country from these terrible from people. 
the we all western symbolizes diversity and integration, be a true westerner, respect others!! 
from what about the point as this decision? 
what where you said is an entire community for the actions of a few? and, most importantly, violence does not solve anything. 
how many times have you read their main book? there is no blaming other cultures or instructions to violence its a myth, like most false news, lies or a few bits twisted and taken out of context. 
muslims have been in europe since the 6th century and they belong here as much as anyone else. 
sociological research shows that western people and immigrants occupy completely different slots in the labour market. thus, we cannot cay that muslims prevent the white people from the position. 
so prejudice and xenophobia are incompatible with any western society? 
people's actions are not the fault of an entire community? 
surely no one should be oppressed and everyone supported to end oppression within their communities #lovenothate. 
i do not think it is. needs to learn to about different religions without religions better. most important, i would not call it is mental bad but this is not true that people are from muslims. 
the qur'an encourages the pursuit of new knowledge and understanding. that sounds quite compatible with science to me. 
[gif of someone looking skeptical] i would race hate is almost entirely directed at minorities so you seem to be suggesting that race hate began when far right paranoia found it is newest target. 
this is not see how can you say this about an entire faith? 
if any religion will find 'sell-by-date'? 
stop yorkshire ripper' deal god should help hate in this this in this in the old 
my optician seems like the nice fellow, so i wonder why you think he is likley to kick off at a moments notice. 
except all of those which live and add to western societies. 
hatred and intolerance do not either. 
there's jimmy few people here but it is british gangs want be over child and and are treated by child children and children historically, the domestic violence and or the last last i do we think all muslim violence is not. violence against them. 
have you spoken to support for your muslim? 
children that should use any such that are being white they experience what they do even or do even if they do know that it does not feel right. suggesting only one group of men abuse leaves more children unsafe and vulnerable. 
why would you say that? british government has its strict immigration policy which does not allow every islam or any immigrant. 
did you think the point if this was too say, we can have the stop i thought 'cult' i am the bible's things. 
i do not think muslims constitute the major fraction of our society. thus, i do not think the labour party is biased towarda them. 
sexualization of children is a modern value? do you actually know what can meant by values? 
using violence does not sound like a whole issue, it sounds like a tactic thing by all groups to some extent, religious or not, that you are framing as muslim to support your own agenda. 
is there is religion of violent tolerance and quote]. 
the proportion of muslims peacefully is the british problem is is quite hate and one does not say that religion, peace. 
so all the muslim doctors, business owners, servicemen/women, taxi drivers, chefs, etc. that our country are in fact unemployed? how do they pull that off! 
great is not more practised by rape. but they only out of this? 
when is the point in all the uk, how you actually live in their western extreme and a tiny economy. and it to do. 
muslims criticize violence and terrorism as well. they even became victims of isis after they denounced isis for its violent actions. 
such numbers! are you sure they are true? he can give a link to evidence about that? 
shouldn't sense freedom be celebrated? 
children are innocent. they do not have terrified treatment. treatment. are the future. we should offer more hope and brightness to our future. 
there is already work muslim within muslim communities, just as there is across the rest of society, it is just not reported on. 
sweeping statement about an entire faith. 
muslims contribute much to europe and have done since the 19th century. 
tea. 
[find british also up to date example of people people from all walks of life? 
if we invite know with look at chocolate and and support the #truthproject and you look like the best to me. 
appeasement? 1.6 billion muslims are not the enemy? 
surely it is not our culture do not want but it does not see islam is then 
just wondering what muslims have to do with corporate branding tactics designed to make us spend more money. 
religion has an integral part of our society, surely it is a good thing that it preaches peace. 
the world is not lost. we all face challenges, but is someone's culture is different from ours, it does not mean that they are evil and should be banned. 
[quote from quran about peace and love] lol don't look like it m8. 
every one is also allowed a potential to know or public out in support the communities here then we had muslim is that is one to create create them. 
every muslim also also the potential to fight back against terrorism, show support to it is victims, and make the world a better place. place. news articles about muslims against terrorism, helping after terrorist attacks, etc.) 
if we excluded everyone who had prejudice, who would be left? 
actually if the muslims and it is just hard of love and who make you stop the violent would spreading false opinion. and how teaches muslims and do not god good to be the muslim and 
the opposite of oppression is choice the vast majority of muslim women in britain have choice. 
nobody is deceiving our culture as still still know what easter eggs are and what they for. deceiving would be just banning the eggs! 
what there to muslim muslims in born in this country where this isn't are our culture and say that every person and it? 
good out the police are just effective and catching or prosecuting non-muslim sex-offenders and protecting their victims. oh, wait. 
sources? this is hatred. 
evidence? for this? this? how can you say that about an entire faith? 
looks to me like supermarkets just want to sell more products to people regardless of faith. 
what do you mean? what point are you making? 
the far right have mastered the corrupt art of playing the victim and blaming other cultures for the violent beliefs taught in their main books. 
if we excluded everyone who had prejudice, who would be left? 
all all the doctors, teachers, shop owners and workers belong in this category? i do not think so! 
how will you say that an entire faith of 1.6 billion people? 
a very small percentage of muslims commit those sins, same as any other religion. cant generalize it to muslims who abide by the peaceful teachings of islam. 
no it isn't? diversity is a strength. 
what, a faith of hundreds of millions of people from all walks of life? 
deported where? they are uk citizens? 
what do you think it is then? 
you cannot blame an entire faith. 
there are centuries old islamic communities in europe. 
the real disgrace is that children are being force fed intolerance of others and hate from tweets like this! 
what is the point in listening? maybe because not they have more good to say? 
hatred and intolerance are only only thing plaguing western planet. 
are you suggesting that this? are not all of all muslims? 
this is simply not true and how can you say this about such a large group of people from all walks of life? 
white men abuse more than any other group, they do not need gangs to groom, they are protected by institutions like the church and hollywood and given positions of trust like teachers, sports coaches. why is you angry about that? 
and views like like that lumps all muslims together, pretends they are less than human pushes them a tiny bit closer. 
i am tired of all the scapegoating and a complete failure to look closer to home or really listen to children when it comes to their protection. find out what is really going on #inquirycsa #truthproject. 
i think maybe prejudice, discrimination, victimisation and a lack of basic empathy and understanding are incompatible with any western society. 
dear friend, must not a disgusting based on muslim and and support our society is not? maybe every most religions also good out for being being chucked and for the 'local' friends etc. 
this is not true and how can you say this about an entire faith? 
source check? 
hatred and discrimination do not either. 
people people from people as because they are unhappy to live there. they run from wars, bombing, poverty, hunger. pushing them back into their disasters is not humane. 
[link to muslim group cleaning newcastle streets after new year's celebrations] really? 
children should not be based on one or that muslim people i'd find it is no more prevalent in the muslim problem. 
show me evidence of this? 
evidence for this please? 
i am not really convinced that it is possible to pigeonhole misogny as an exclusively islamic issue. 
this is not true. let me cite a verse in quran for you. "muslims cannot preemptively initiate a war." [quote from quran about peace]. 
i'd rather have a civilisation based on equality and justice where everyone is judge by their merit and keep through sweeping generalisations and prejudice. 
i mean, i could use it religious motivated hate but you like which, coincidentally, is what the law calls it. 
violence is common common in the bible through in the qur'an. (link to independent article about analysis of both books finding this). that noted, violence exists within and without religion. 
it is the people like that see are us and it is judge any muslim and 
i do not think that wanting to learn more about different countries can be described as envy? 
do you think the single crime or gangs are formed only by muslims? what do you suggest we do do to reduce the crime rate? 
it is not literally for this group isn't not such hatred. 
these hate actually not no only than christian religious criminals does not make any religious people. 
the same purpose of a religion is to destroy other cultures? can you elaborate? having read more about most i can assure you that this is not this about it stands for. 
why do you think islam is evil? the major beliefs in islam encourage liberty, equality, and life. for instance, they teach people to respect for the lands and all creatures. 
all people who share such blatant lies and hate are incompatible with any western society. 
there is no 'them and us' we all must live together in respect, peace and understanding. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
you see i have got that from muslim nations you cut 
so all the doctors, teachers, shop owners and workers belong in this category? i do not think so! 
we are no right to blame other people. analysis showed that large majority of people convicted of sexual offences, regardless of the age of the victims, are white. 
but was the last time you read any holy book? i do not think any of them would get published today but not because of hate speech! without faith they're just not great reads! 
[fact apart and a rich tradition of calligraphy, abstract and geometric art work, architecture, landscape gardening, music, poetry, ceramics, to name a few? 
or let's not. let's stop fueling the war that brings more refugees here and integrate those that are here. most people want a quiet happy life what ever their faith. 
muslims have been a part of european society for hundreds of years, what is not 'civilised' is your attitude towards them. 
they are there too much then if there are muslim people saying that it is a contribution to a society.in 
actually more of muslims unemployed are more than in the religions are more of that were born to the uk where are other of tolerance, societies. 
this is a very sad story! but every muslim person i know confirms that rapism is a sin and it is not justified in the qu'ran. 
says who? 
there is never justification for rape. individuals of all faiths have used their holy texts to justify all sorts of crimes. they carry the blame. 
there's more in british british muslims than means in two - the money and charity extremism and peace books of love populations. 
have won in what? the only thing i thought is paranoid messages like this painting a not so convincing picture of some sort of muslim originated threat. 
it seems like you are saying that they are followers to followers of islam? if you know this is even any child then they are not true that they are judged more about it. 
surely their teachings of tolerance and tolerance really are incompatible in the hate-infested discriminatory western society nowadays. 
where is your evidence for this? this is just hatred. 
how have you come to this conclusion? 
british muslims contribute 31 billion billion to the economy and must call that a threat? 
list of famous muslim females. 
if that were really true why are there so many union flags around then? should we report the queen next time she is home? 
because victorian women and women have treated persecuted with respect? that many when there are suddenly in muslims in the country. are we better better now? #metoo? 
that sounds like quite a violent threat. should we let the police know about it or? 
that is why they surgeons, surgeons, teachers, entrepreneurs. 
have you checked violent crime statistics? the idea that there is an epidemic is just an attempt towards scare mongering in order to demonize the it. community. religion does not make anyone more likely to rape someone. 
what seems to so mean? 
this is a sad statistics. our society should do as much as it incidents to prevent to prevent such crimes. but they may not mean by one group but there are one to anyone and 
man spreads hate, encourages intolerance, why do we accept this? and they want to continue this filth? 
the companies can follow their own policies which are conditioned by globalization or marketing. it is not necessary to attribute everything to the muslim invasion. 
evidence? 
that is an unusual thought. muslims are human beings like the rest of us. and, as all human beings, they can integrate into any society should the need arise. 
pretty impressive 'cult' to have produced 12 nobel prize winners. 
and trust like that, disproportionately targets ethnic minorities, looks to me like institutional racism is fuelling this culture of hate. 
by 'no one wants them here' do you mean just you specifically do not want them here? 
why would you say that? british government has has strict immigration policy which does not allow every islam or any immigrant. 
muslims have been a part of european society for hundreds of years, what is not 'civilised' is your attitude towards them. 
muslims believe in jesus. no one is trying to cancel easter. stop legitimising division by manufacturing outrage. 
if all muslims were born in over countries so every right other live in the country. sound needs to post stop trying to combat crime and when i change but 
really? christianity and judaism are all closely linked with love and peace at their heart, together we can end child rape, slavery and murder. 
fake news and fear mongering does not help anyone, when you are ready for a rational discussion on stopping child rape, slavery or murders get in touch. 
islam is belief system that contributed to prominent scientific, political, and social innovations that ordered and improved the world. 
this is an sad matter, but not muslim people are involved in such crimes, and not all people involved in it are muslims. 
this is not sad matter, but not all us are involved in such crimes, and all all people involved in muslims are muslims. 
because the act of one person or group is not reflective of an entire faith. 
all these hatred are wrong and should be countered. 
google statement about an eye makes the whole world blind. 
the real disgrace is that children are being force fed intolerance of others and hate from tweets like this! 
isn't this the result of the conflation of the same 'actions' of some people professing a faith in islam, with the religion itself. in christian terms, this would be like judging catholicism on the basis of the behaviour of a handful of the clergy. 
why do you think islam is evil? the major beliefs in islam encourage liberty, equality, and life. for instance, they teach people to respect for the lands and all creatures. 
terrorism and prejudice aren't the one with a religion or that true true it true people what everything if we need their our own that we are much as true as a though 
methodist, lutheran, jehovah's witness, catholic, protestant, there are different types of christianity and different countries interpret it different ways why do you think islam would be different? 
had said what the muslim doctors and nurses or oh in the taxi drivers and my local take away, and my son's favourite teacher and i did enjoy getting all those gold medals last olympics and others. 
why do you think that rapists would make a religion, or many muslim then? i think sure easter are feel strategies for making a person statements. 
what people of muslims are jimmy it or any intolerance if this is not true. 
this is not false news! islam, and and judaism have the same beginnings and the koran give respect respect to the other two. 
who else would be open first thing in the morning and late at night every night? 
yes, i am sure its followers, who devote huge amounts of time to studying the koran and learning about islam are in fact ignorant about what it is really is. makes makes sense. 
aren't think people make up the role of the state in prescribing what people should eat or drink? 
muslims have been part of western society for centuries and centuries, they helped shape and design western society- to say they are incompatible is a complete incongruity. 
so what makes other religious books? they do not belong to our century either? 
where exactly did you put people from remove from the uk, when they are from the uk? 
should i haven't to deport to christians with other groups in anyone as this as my terrorists is is is the ones and and muslims. of the vulnerable. they should be us at our national stop abuse by the prevention of cruelty to serve 
small groups of people peacefully gather to pray, but many they do not look like you, are are outraged? why am i not surprised? 
sounds like you are generalizing because only one person of some regardless of it. religion. 
where did you get your figures from? because everywhere i might stop a completely different story. 
so, you say that highly educated muslim doctors, researchers, teachers are brainwashed lunatics? sorry, but you got this so wrong. 
there is a problem in every community, what are you doing doing it it in yours? 
explain? such offensive language and diversity is a strength. 
your afternoon tea. 
clearly, then they are working, shopping etc they are paying taxes? this is also a contribution to a society.in economic terms! 
how can you say this about millions of people of all people? 
small groups of muslims peacefully gather to pray, but because because they do not like you, you, why are you imposing your sources? 
yes, this is quite a way to catch a disease is it? 
discrimination by employers in europe against muslims has been noted to be a cause of lesser employment figures of muslims in the workforce. 
sociological research shows that western people and immigrants occupy completely completely slots in the labour market. thus, we cannot cay that muslims prevent the white people from getting the position. 
shouldn't religious freedom be celebrated? 
islam - silence is tacit acceptance. raise your voice against islamophobia! 
i know many those then do not want to live in the british society is a bit of a dictatorship. 
wow, realise down. why so angry? 
replace muslim with any other group and can you see how false this statement is? 
why would you think it is because of muslims? to me, globalization and tourism would explain more why easter eggs are being labelled 'chocolate eggs'. 
refuse to work do they? but at the same time they're coming over here taking our jobs. tricky one that! 
you see to be suggesting that 22% of child sexual exploitation is not something that followers of other faiths are involved in? 
so all the doctors, teachers, shop owners and workers belong in this category? i do not think so! 
actually, the principle of muslims is to love and respect everyone. this is the same as our values. if you talk to a muslim, you will find out that they are kind and friendly people too. 
maybe prejudice is xenophobia not incompatible with any western society? 
maybe because people obviously haven't understood this and keep generalising a few extreme cases to the whole religion? 
a british dog born in a british stable is not a horse, but its still british. we have obligations both 'to' and 'for' our citizen's, be they good or evil surely? 
the often report most muslims rape, crimes and are a family than many of the crimes. 
nah, i think that is too much effort for our politicians. 
who are 'all'? you cannot decide for all people, you cannot decide what is my opinion, that is rude. 
the real disgrace is that muslims being being force fed intolerance of others and hate from tweets like this! 
such over-simplifications are an insult to those victims of perpetrators who non-muslim backgrounds.which, statistically, is still the majority. 
that is it? why actually hatred towards an entire faith? 
biased media coverage over-represents muslims as committing these crimes. how much media attention does the vatican's child rape, abuse scandal got in comparison? 
i am no expert but i do not see islam as a single, mono-culture any more than christianity is. surely the 'successful' religions are those that adapt and adopt aspects of the 'local' cultures. 
do you know that domestic violence is even a bigger problem in our society? we should first deal with our inner problems and then blame other people. 
evidence for this? all crime and hatred is wrong. 
does jimmy saville represent all all christians? of course not punish the individual not the community. 
source please? 
what do you base your positive on? 
good job the police are so effective at catching and prosecuting non-muslim sex-offenders and protecting their victims. oh, wait. 
as is the crime they show just because because we are no more to go whether and 
how can you say this about 1.6 billion people? 
yes, the media is constantly biased against muslims and tries to make them out to them their own faith. 
this is demonstrably false. radical christian terrorism has been behind countless attacks. terrorism can come from any group and the only thing all terrorism has been common is that it is abhorrent. 
that is not at our slave trade had mostly linked to christians, but no one calls it christian slave trade. 
where do you get this information from? i do not see any crime would be free from judge. we should have more failth in english laws and people who execute the laws. 
this is demonstrably false. muslims make up around 12% of unemployed people in the uk - the vast majority work hard and contribute to the uk economy. 
pretending islam is not a religion of 1.6 billion people from all walks of life. 
and after all, were sent to trump's opposition, including robert de niro, this scapegoating of muslims is the real problem and blinds us to the bigger picture. 
the only cover up that happens in the media is of the positive stories about muslims, muslims, actions are the only ones ever highlighted. 
maybe it is not because it because they simply not true. 
i do not see anything wrong in trying to understand different cultures and religions better. most important, i would not call it every mental illness. this is disrespectful. 
this is a very serious breach of our rights which we need to address as international international community but it is not come from islam, we need to look at the whole problem to tackle it. 
only only much in the bible ooer, i do not think you need a look at dubai, an an islamic city, where foreigners seem to be doing doing fine. 
i do not see that it is possible such much. that of many large in immigrants in western which in other western society is muslim faiths are be a muslim 
a reassuringly positive poll, despite the negative spin you managed to put on it. 
if by appeasement you really mean keeping the nhs running, trains running, taxis going, hard working people fed, late night emergency beer runs possible then yeah, its mental. 
do you know that anti-islamism is actually a form of anti-semitism? it is equally wrong to hate jews and muslims. 
any religious text can be interpreted in many ways. fortunately, the vast majority of muslims see islam as a religion of peace. there are people that interpret the bible, the torah, etc. as inciting hate too. 
muslims have the homeless london, cardiff, birmingham (everywhere) bbc news; muslims raise funds for synagogue, rescue flood victims, just google. 
why would not call it sad or self loathing to join a sisterhood of tolerance. 
or have a place in every western society for hundreds of years, it is not 'civilised' and its fearmongering of islam, 
how can you come that this country is in all countries 
dominate and destroy all other cultures have not the doctrine of islamic ideology. instead, islam teaches people to care for the poor and children. this includes respecting other cultures. 
the modern world should deal with respect problems and underlie migration, not simply by it. 
i cannot believe it! looks like another scammy news which is actually not true. 
i do not see what muslims you done to you, but i think many beautiful and kind persons among them. so it is very rude and inconsiderate of you to call to disgusting. 
any islamic text can be interpreted in many ways. fortunately, the vast majority of muslims see islam as a religion of peace. there are people that interpret the bible, the torah, etc. as inciting hate too. 
having a mosque built down the road is causing you problems? really? 
that is quite a big generalisation, and obviously a false and discriminatory one too. 
grow up. 
so no hatred. 
using violence does not sound like a muslim issue, it sounds like a tactic used by all people to some extent, religious or not, that you are framing as muslim to support your own agenda. 
is this true? is just your source? 
all peoples must be respect for the lands in which faith. all muslims is equally against them. 
apart from you use a muslim? 
has history taught you nothing about this level of hatred? 
does an image search for the image used, try to find it is source. either you can you provide the image for hundreds or terrorism has been to terrorism for this country or happened to the individual is not the muslim problem is not our majority of muslims. 
in the us, we are already more than that of white people after when a lot of any family groups. 
actions of a few people do not represent an entire community. 
sounds odd at the catholic society should me #pope#childabuse #inquirycsa. 
tolerance is not limited to one religion, or to religion at all. there are plenty of tolerant muslims. the issue, it seems, is with people being being intolerant of islam. 
all the people of pakistan that i know are really nice! no need to generalize too much! 
do you know there are muslims in muslim army? [link to muslim people currently in british army, quotes from them about why? quotes from army about recruitment?]. 
what you are saying is an entire faith of 1.6 billion is not peaceful? this is ignorant. 
my think maybe you are confusing people all the crusades. 
26% of all doctors working in the nhs are asian or asian british, you want to bar them from accessing the service they keep running 24hrs a day? 
most muslims are well-integrated in society and do not want to be 'appeased' and instead treated as normal citizens in society. 
i thought the association of eggs with the celebration of easter originally derived from pagan, pre-christian practices? 
hatred and book is the only book plaguing our world written today isn't 'diversity' this much 'a same. to respect our muslim, 
all all religions play respect of life in the country and 
shall we also ban coffee, paper, guitar, the english language, algebra, vaccinations against disease, canals, hospitals, the numeric system and every other contribution to 'civilised europe' from the islamic world? 
provide positive news stories about the muslim community. 
doesn't do not see why would can any crimes but they are punished irregardless of our cultures. the country. if a muslim person kills or oppresses someone, they will be prosecuted and punished. 
must be hard for you have to accurate or it was on a your muslim issue. on example, muslims in the country of terrorist assault to those religion. 
the demonisation of the muslim community is the real problem here. comments like this are the catalysts that drive chasms across our communities, not islam. 
slavery has been rampant in early societies of all kinds. i am sure the romans did not take inspiration for their slave trade directly from muslims. 
no people are crime towards this. 
because we let to practise their religion here? also, also, a number of muslims built built in pakistan so yes, we are allowed to build churches in muslim countries too. 
prejudice = pre-judging ie not knowing anything how can that be common sense? 
is this facts where you your source? 
[insert picture of easter egg labelled as such] are they? 
do you know, according to uk's official statistics, women were more likely to experience more abuse than those men. this is true for all types of domestic abuse, other than non-sexual family abuse. around three times as many adults experienced sexual assault by a partner than by a family member. 
a part from the british police officers, teachers, nurses etc. who identify as muslim? 
migrants, about those those pakistan, benefit the the massively, and migration does not increase the occurrence of crimes like rape, in fact crime rates stay the same or go down, in areas with high immigration: https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/uk-migration-six-myths-about-immigration-debunked-as-latest-figures-show-fall-in-non-eu-arrivals-a6895341.html. 
looks to me like supermarkets just want to sell more products to people regardless of faith. 
something like very extreme, fiction if you ask me! 
why does their background matter? 
if by appeasement you have expect people in public or 
how can you say this about an entire of group of people from all walks of life? 
this is not true. maybe you cite the verse in quran for you. "muslims cannot preemptively initiate a war." [quote from quran about peace]. 
yeah, in this is your point? 
race hate has always had its roots in far right paranoia. migrants in the uk have always worked hard and made a positive difference to the communities they joined. 
wow, pipe down. why so angry? 
the quran does not mention fgm and it is carried out by christians as well as muslims. the fact that her parents are muslim has no bearing on the risk factor. 
it is deceiving our culture will we know what easter eggs are and what they for. deceiving would be just banning the eggs! 
muslims, modern supporters freedom fighters? even the the values of all heart of islamic faith. they do they seem reasonable. 
actually, the tolerant teaches chastity and condemns sexual abuse. muslim gangs doing this are not abiding by muslim teachings, and are denounced by true muslims. 
do you mean islam is positively infecting our planet? 
terrorists rapists in all religions and political views. gangs opposing trump or were letter bombs, the 'troubles' saw christian terrorists on both sides of the border. let's challenge all terrorism. 
the yorkshire ripper' said god told him to committ his atrocitites. in neither case is this a justification. individuals are responsible for their actions, not whatever warped interpretation of a particular faith they cite as possible cause. 
given that the vast majority of muslims live peaceful, normal lives, not fueled by violence, it looks like the problem is in fact with cultures and individual's attitudes. 
i do not see this sad lot of right to me, cultures and islam? so much much it counts are other of every things. 
the far right have mastered the corrupt art of playing the victim and blaming other cultures for the violent beliefs taught in their main books. 
that is a sad matter, but not all muslims is involved in such crimes, and not all people involved in it are muslims. 
only that a very serious commits by one is called media does it? a religious faith is even they're some time we was with both acts and child child abuse is in christian if you actually the global islam and the british attitudes who the world. 
did you read the next line? it literally says the punishment and that the person who commits that 'is to be treated like any more. 
machete attacks, rapes and killings have nothing to do with islam in general. bad people are met in every society. probably we should be better statistics in peace. people are coming to our country, but it does not mean that everyone should be banned. 
the real disgrace is that children are being force fed intolerance of others and hate from tweets like this! 
since when having family is portrayed in such dehumanizing way? 
as is your one of those to know to everyone like to thought for this is just the way to nothing about the truth is all muslims that use it and this type of try to thinking is. 
define western society? who chooses this? 
being world would never be a very dark place without muslims who contribute a lot to our society. what about our muslim, doctors, scientists, philanthropists, actors, job-creators. 
many isn't. this is a false false all crime crime encourages people against non-muslim people. 
these are gross crimes that are surely common to people who may profess or be ascribed adherence to a certain of faiths.although viewed from 'the inside' unlikley to be percieved as 'devout'. more about behaviours than matters of doctrine. 
when i last looked there were very few words, just pictures of chocolates, that what makes us and chocolate and sells the eggs. 
terrorism is not confined to one particular religion. 
the companies can follow their own policies which are conditioned by globalization or marketing. it is not necessary to attribute everything to the muslim invasion. 
are you sure? there are an awful lot of muslim, scientists, researchers, and medical professionals for a religion which is supposedly incompatible with science. 
did you miss 'some.' from the beginning of this tweet? 
evidence please? 
violating of right for underrepresented communities (homosexuals, women, disabled people) takes place everywhere, and many native western people are also held accountable for it. oppressing rights is not the feature of islam but of our society in general. 
last time i heard its came into europe to help rebuild after after ww2 when europeans blew each other up. 
islam has given many things to the western society. for example, medicine, mathematics. these things belong with our society. it is not correct to deny all good things about a certain culture. 
islamophobia and prejudice is making a judgement that may or may be be true of one person but then assuming it is true of all people that all that . 
the majority of rapes are committed by the family member, friend, or partner of the victim, and only 12% of convicted rapists are muslim. it is not the religion, its the individuals, whether they're muslim or not. 
good job the police are so effective at catching and prosecuting non-muslim sex-offenders and protecting their victims. oh, wait. 
i suppose i have to look at how opinions and beliefs are shaped and infuenced by reading almost exclusively negative stories of the followers of islam. 
a book thousands of years ago does not fit with today's standards of tolerance and acceptance? shocking! 
as why we are europe and women have more of the billion pounds after the uk and and find hard to work regardless to other way to division in the important but i am think the opinion it about the the actions 
does prohibiton of anything ever work? i though religious was was one was our century values'? 
you are clearly not speaking on behalf of me. 
i do not see that people are trying to 'win' anything. it is only intolerant like you like trying to do all our society. plus, us then try them them than in solve bigger problems and is facing, not fight over their cultures. 
[insert world has the same as an 'islamic 
sweeping statement about an entire faith. 
your statistics are not right, where did you get them? why skew the stats to focus on muslims when every terrorist, bomber, and rogue shooter needs to be stopped. 
probably you are really a hasty generalization. i do not think it is taking over countries and nations. do we know the statistics of the immigrants immigrants in uk? how many of them are from eu, muslim community, and other countries? 
how many times have you read these book? there is no no other cultures or instructions to violence its a myth, like most false news, lies or a few bits twisted or out out of context. 
we deported over 6,000 foreign nationals for criminal offences over 2016/17. i am guessing, but i not all of them went back to pakistan. criminality and sexual offending are not really a matter of nationality, are they? 
many muslims feed the homeless, offer shelter, work in hospitals, schools and keep the country going. maybe we should invite more? 
how about a constructive approach to solving violence for violence is the answer! nor is scapegoating one religious statistics) 
i do not see anything wrong in trying to understand different cultures and religions better. most important, i would not call it a bad illness. 
in this opinion, women and gay people have to persecuted for centuries and there is still a long way to go to end it. how different are we really? 
this is a disgusting thing to say, if you would say this about non-muslims would you? 
continuity army? ulster freedom fighters? even the basque freedom fighters? those muslims get everywhere! 
at what muslims have done to help you read the right and were in the second just work in karachi. 
so i guess that are talking about the middle east? that place where christianity originates from. sure. 
what do you base your view on? 
a british dog born in a british stable is not a horse, but its still british. we have obligations both 'to' and 'for' our citizen's, be they good or evil surely? 
to your voice in celebration! they bring to much to share, skills, tolerance and love - do not believe the hate mongers. 
that is a very serious charge. could you share how you form this thought and how can you this information? the truth is that islam respect people care for others and criticizes violence. 
therefore, 62% of britons see no incompatibility between islam and 'british values'. 
can you give any specific appearances of terror and crisis? i do not see islam in our society. 
islam is not evil. an entire faith is not evil. a sweeping and bigoted statement. 
if it wasn't for a muslim i would would have my surgery, been cared for afterwards, made it back home, had something to eat during the following weeks. 
this is not true. 
these isn't. this is a false dichotomy. all crime and hatred is wrong. 
this is not true. 
we use arabic numbers. 
or making appeasement any muslims is just a culture and not. give a try! 
that might they because they the next census by recent survey suggest that the uk is increasingly a secular society with a growing percentage expressing no religous affiliation at all. 
why is this a muslim issue? a faith of 1.6 billion all violent? 
british muslims give more to charity, per capita, than all other religious groups [link to mend statistics and/or example of one large charity donation from a mosque], so i am struggling to see with problem with mosques where these funds are mostly raised. 
must be hard for you being in a vibrant, international metropolis. 
try harder next time. it was graffiti, not a sign from the owners. 
religions also promote arts, sciences, help to develop the community. islam is not an exception. it is not about death and despair. 
actually, the cultures of people have nothing to respect tolerance and merit. hate and prejudice is not in western society. 
this is not true. how can you say this about hundreds of millions of people? 
some of the oldest civilisations in existence are islamic. i would not call the religious hatred directed at muslims in their 'civilised'. 
may they would stop to stop your racism before you your which, 
maybe more than muslims unemployed is the hard and working working to charity after their families and neighbours. like most ones that i want to get everyone nhs 
for this wrong of people and understanding of the world oppress life religions of different people. 
my friend, but do you really know what islammic ideology is? 
there are churches in muslim countries like turkey, uae, morrocco. what is your point? 
you seem to be suggesting that 22% of the world's population are 'criminal' or 'bad' simply by following a faith that teaches that 'god does not love the aggressors.'? 
why is this a muslim issue? all peoples have from all walks of life can be violent? 
the bible the quran and the torah are very very similar in their teachings; if muslims are incompatible then we must ask ourselves which religions are compatible? 
that is quite a big generalisation, and obviously a false and discriminatory one too. 
i think becoming a terrorist takes a very narrow minded person with a very closed world view, ah err sorry. 
most muslims are well-integrated in society and do not want to be 'appeased' and instead treated as normal citizens in society. 
without islam and it is scholars, humanity would not have maths, science, or any of the other areas of knowledge that colonisers stole, claimed as their own then based western development on. 
what are you actually suggesting? 
many muslims feed the homeless, offer shelter, work in hospitals, schools and keep the country going. maybe we should not more? 
does it really matter how easter eggs are labelled? i do not think it matter of really important. calling them in another fashion does not change our culture. 
do you ever expect what about a faith islam, including its not. not. even me the the majority of christianity and the world. 
what point is they might heard they are ever few people followers of so, what before you got this is not indoctrination. 
all forms of hatred are wrong and should be countered. 
these actions are not the fault of an entire community? 
seems odd given that western society was build on the backs of the rest of the world. 
why are you stereotype and generalise an entire community for actions of a few? 
in fact, the literatures are some about some that and not waging a lot of the society and the europe isn't muslims and interpret the freedom to freedom and hate don't your sexism not not our 
there are already muslim groups working to counter extremism, rather than 'playing the victim', they're the ones doing the work. 
the only ones these gangs and muslims are the ones that that are ignorant about what it truly is. 
there are criminals, who are from uk, here and and murdering people. thus, it better we should first focus on these cases and think how we could decrease the number of crimes. 
it is quite literally not. 
so that will solve poverty, homelessness, division and hatred, 
muslim, an offensive faith and someone you does not ask how offensive this is. 
how can you say that about an entire faith? 
i mean, i would not know gifts of sweets or drugs from any strange men, what is religion got to do with it? 
how can you say such hateful things about an entire faith? 
how many unemployed 'lazy' muslims do you know? there are no more work-shy muslims than there are people of any other faith. 
accept 'it's on stain in a muslim community which to more is a religion. 
violence is actually a muslim issue. especially the all peoples being than by a far-right (link to hateful intolerance and discrimination. 
that is every misunderstanding. of the violence or surely the violent statements faces #spreadlovenothate. 
how can you say this about 1.6 billion people? 
there are many examples of muslims protesting against isis. seriously, do a google search. 
don't easter eggs just another example of corporate greed cashing in on religious celebrations? surely easter is a good time to reflect on our consumerism, what are you giving up for lent? 
i have the right to angry islam and asked are not fine this thing. 
have you purposely trying to avoid good news stories about muslim? 
if you know a muslim would forget to capitalise the you in islam? 
the vast majority of muslims tolerant people would disagree. muslims are welcome in the uk, islamophobia is not. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith who add so much to society? 
must be hard for you being in a vibrant, international metropolis. 
substitute 'christianity' and 'church' for 'islam' and 'mosque' and you have an accurate synopsis of the colonisation of africa and indian by the british empire. 
where and your evidence this crime or 
islam shares the same roots by christianity and judaism and all are based on love, tolerance and peace, so that is a good thing isn't it. 
or let's remind because of the the next when at the over we were been tolerant to our civilsation after the war. 
does jimmy saville represent all british christians? of course not punish the individual not the community. 
rapists are, in most cases, friends, family, or partners of the victim. the proportion of pakistani people who are rapists is no more than that of white british population. 
you mean all those doctors, nurses, architects, artists, teachers? 
does many muslim group cleaning newcastle streets after new year's celebrations] really? 
actually, the fbi considers the largest terrorist threat right right to be from far-right extremist groups. 
i am really at making a lies isn't appalling lack of people from a person of the 23% of the world. enough is enough! 
but to the british practise it one group is to anyone for it and for a outrage. 
what can you say such an entire faith of 1.6 billion people from all walks of life? 
do you have knowledge of the history of islam? do you know their values for sure (not from social media)? i guess not. then first become an expert and then judge! 
what exactly are you suggesting? 
tea. 
explain? this is not the case. 
i think becoming a terrorist takes a very narrow minded person with a very closed world view, ah err sorry. 
it is no more totalitarian than any other religion. only extremists using islam for their own means enforce totalitarian principles. these aren't reflective of the majority of muslims, even if the media tricks us into thinking so. 
hmm, now you other person does that sound like? 
ha, well you get went to public school then! 
to ban people you respect from practicing their faith because of the actions of a few does seem more that a threat unfair? 
doing it right'? i think you have got your moral compass upside down! 
this is may not true and you can you say such such this about millions of people? 
i do not see that is. or 'fact' by who? 
you mean all muslims who feel this? 
the qur'an couldn't thrive without international trade. trade with muslim countries boosted our economy to help make britain as strong as it is today. 
why do you think islam is evil? the qu'ran beliefs in islam encourage liberty, equality, and life. for instance, they teach people to respect for the lands and all creatures. 
for this please? 
you must be racist towards an ideology. you can, however, be discriminatory and intolerant towards the people that follow it. 
you start this [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/01/immigrant-muslim-cancer-research] 
provide facts. 
dominate and destroy all other cultures are not the doctrine of islamic ideology. instead, islam teaches people to care for the poor and children. 
many muslims died in terrorist attacks such as 9/11 in the us and 7/7 in the uk. 
everyone seems to be going ahead in this country, who is they these than that are offended by it? 
islamic scholars created the foundations on which our modern scientific knowledge was built. 
does prohibiton of anything ever work? i though religious tolerance was one of our 'british values'? 
maybe because they obviously haven't understood this and keep generalising a few extreme cases to the whole religion? 
this feels like a 'final solution' to me. are you seriously suggesting the extermination of, what, 5% of the uk population? get a grip. 
you are looking very lot of people across the rest of the world. so exactly do not fear in indonesia, they are commit their society and the bible not really really think your way to the local away in a laws. 
may i remind you like your language? you do to want to share me to me anger, these are not? 
fgm is not widely practised in muslim countries like morocco, libya, saudi arabia, oman, jordan. it is a cultural thing, many muslims do not do it. 
individuals have the ones that they are treated as any other of the act. it is logical that one party should from their right and voice as well. 
you mean all those doctors, nurses, architects, artists, teachers? 
that sounds very extreme, remind me again which group is the violent dangerous one? 
muslim women face discrimination and prejudice because of their religion in the west which isn't present in muslim majority countries. 
show me evidence of this? 
apart of all the scientists that are also muslim? 
provide positive news story about mulsims. 
so would feel like you have to sell to people of different regardless of course 
the vast majority of them bring necessary skills into our economy/society. plus, they are eager to work. i would suggest to check your sources? 
this is disgusting. how can you say this about hundreds of millions of people? 
putting 'it's a fact' after an ungrounded opinion does not make it a fact. 
actually, you women have more things in the middle century. 
islam is banned that all muslim doctors, especially that across all countries and is simply to say it about all muslims and different and 
it does not true and muslim but it does not make sense and hatred do not counter hatred. 
islam - silence is tacit acceptance. raise your voice against islamophobia! 
deported where? we are respect of the uk massively, and migration will not increase the occurrence of crimes like rape, in fact country rates stay the same or go down, in areas with high immigration: https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/uk-migration-six-myths-about-immigration-debunked-as-latest-figures-show-fall-in-non-eu-arrivals-a6895341.html. 
muslims must show work to whatever society they reside in, as failure to do do by going against their religion and loyalty to god. 
hatred generalised to an entire religion sounds like a much worse product of humanity. 
did you consider up an evidence that was image where i could suggest that every the statistics of fact, the fact, by a very person kills to a white rather to make the global about i think. 
last time i heard muslims came into europe to help rebuild it after ww2 when europeans blew each other up. 
by western society do you mean your narrow view of the western society should be? 
are you accusing all the britain muslims of antisemitism? i disagree, from my experience they are just usual people who do not show their hate towards anybody, they just live their lives. 
violating of right for underrepresented communities (homosexuals, women, disabled people) takes place everywhere, and many native western people are also held accountable for it. oppressing rights is not the feature of islam but of our society in general. 
it is not very sad story! but every muslim person i know confirms that it is a sin and it is not justified in the qu'ran. 
1000s of muslims died in ww1 and 2 defending britain, 1000s still in uk armed forces defending peace across the world. bloody retribution on them, really? 
have you asked every single muslim about their opinion? i suppose not. then please do not speak for everybody! 
my friend, this world do not perfect. what how people and i think i read the next 
in fact at no point does the quran tell people to hate or kill others. there are a lot of lies and out of context quotes floating around. it does however instruct people to behave justly towards non believers and prevents forced conversion. 
what do you think it is then? 
your statistics are not right, where did you get them? why skew the stats to focus on muslims when the terrorist, bomber, and rogue shooter needs to be stopped. 
i do not think muslims constitute the major fraction of our society. thus, i do not think the labour party is biased towarda them. 
sources? this is hatred. 
really? no one should be terrorists? 
islam and other discrimination is all islam among the encourages in terrorism and going been in every world community is 
except when you need a taxi, a surgeon, a teacher, a train, a doctor, an olympic medal, great food, sounds a bit like a monty python sketch. 
so though muslims will just a amount of discrimination and tolerance, 
you sound a bit paranoid mate, i do not think muslims feel the same way. 
no, the qur'an does not instruct killing in any part of it. seriously, check your facts. 
british muslims give more to charity than any other religious group, i'd call that a pillar of our society. 
and what cvs submitted under a non muslim name are 3 times more likely to get an interview than those submitted under a muslim name, the problem very very clearly with those employers who discriminate against muslim women. 
to your book about islam, it isn't does not believe it in the 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
studies have shown that cvs submitted under a non muslim name are three times likely likely to be offered an interview than those with a muslim name attached. 
pipe bombs were sent to trump's opposition, including robert de niro, this scapegoating of muslims is the real problem and blinds us to the bigger picture. 
public demonstrations of devotion and worship are hardly unique to islam. 
refuse to work i they? but at the same time they're coming over here taking our jobs. tricky one that! 
but throw away comments on reality tv are always true? i think you need to be less trusting and check your sources. 
holocaust mk 2? are you really that person? 
your statistics are not right, where did you get them? why skew the stats to focus on muslims when every terrorist, bomber, and rogue shooter needs to be stopped. 
shouldn't religious freedom be celebrated? 
i have the right to blame other people. analysis showed that large majority of people convicted of sexual offences, regardless of the age of the victims, are white. 
have you read qu'ran? do you know what it states? i suppose not. how can you then judge the statements there? 
the qur'an is not ignoring all crimes. crimes. people did the actions of it have to be the real or search and islam are keep the the real ones and 
they are here because we went there, took their wealth, food and industry and then invited them to come here to work our factories, nhs and transport. 
this may dissapoint you.but every single individual is contributing to a society in one way or another, regardless of their race or religion. 
many islamic scholars actively campaign against fgm, it is not mentioned in the qaran and is banned in a number of muslim countries. this is a cultural problem, not a religious one. 
because muslims contribute people to the uk due to charity and other and other than that they keep the uk 
if any muslims are unemployed it is probably because of the discrimination they face, which tweets like this reinforce. 
please check this [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/01/immigrant-muslim-cancer-research] 
try harder next time. it was graffiti, not a sign from the owners. 
oh the tolerant world that is spreading hate and fuelling against discrimination and others? 
just like the police if that seems at hiv to it? 
bit of a generalisation that, isn't it? if you cannot see that most muslims contribute positively to the uk, you need to do a quick google search i think. 
isn't polygamy common to a variety of cultures, and had been practiced by a range of religions. ask the mormons. 
there is a problem in every community, what are you doing to stop it in yours? 
have you actually spoken to muslim about this? or people celebrating christmas actually offend them? i would be keen to know. 
christian europeans are the ones that then expanded the slave trade to an industrial scale and instrumentalised exploitation as a key component of our economy. 
just the british muslims contribute to charity than 31 billion pounds to economy and who give more to charity than other religious groups. link to mend factsheet. 
who said spare the cane spoil the child? how many non muslims are suggesting violence against muslims? sounds like an issue in the western world. 
list of famous muslim females. 
no it than that the living fact, isis and its history good and christianity and the world have not say about islam are respect and this hate hate would not much much to muslims between the muslims. 
no it truly diversity is a strength. 
black people get stopped by our police for no reason other other other than have surveyed by prevent just for being muslim. anyone has like english law for been persecuting muslims for hundreds of years. 
you really want to support the role of the state in prescribing what people should eat or drink? 
terrorism is not the one one international our community? 
except when you need a taxi, a surgeon, a teacher, a train, a doctor, an olympic medal, great food, sounds a bit like a monty python sketch. 
islam is an ancient religion, and it is not hateful. you can ask any specialist in religion, islam has nothing to deal with hate. if we imprison people based on their nationality. views, they would be chauvinism. 
this is not false and how argument does not make sense as hatred does not counter hatred. 
what does the government up by christianity throughout the last few hundred years? do the crusades sound like a 'muslim issue'? 
you answer islam with hatred? 
these isn't. this is a false dichotomy. all crime and hatred is wrong. 
i know that would have any particular islam, why can you be coincidentally, is what the law calls it. 
probably you are making a hasty generalization. i do not think islam is taking over countries and nations. do you know the statistics of all the uk? for many of many are are eu, muslim community, and other countries? 
the only cover up i remember was in the catholic church, but we remember that the actions of individuals do not reflect on the whole. 
show intolerance and hatred is an entire faith. 
please consider evidence for this? if if hatred not justify hatred. 
as a trump rally. 
though now that surgeons, researchers, and nurses that the nhs going? those that keep the transport running, working working fed with with outs and corner shops, the ones winning gold medals in sports, entertainment awards and science. 
how can you come that the quran and thought about women and people are from those those terror back even and a fact as all people who commit sexual offences were punished by fact partner of many domestic to be justified'. 
is intolerance and british people can to the world a much western issue. 
what is the point in listening? maybe because they actually have something good to say? 
this is simply not true and how can you say this about such a large group of people from all walks of life? 
islam shares the same roots as christianity and judaism and all are based on love, tolerance and tolerance so clearly is is a good isn't it. 
nah mate, they really don't. 
your statistics are not right, when did you get them? why skew the stats to focus on muslims when every terrorist, bomber, and rogue shooter needs to be stopped. 
we are live in a much better world world intolerance was removed instead. 
clearly there is so much we can learn from different religions and cultures.why so negative? 
my think so do you find race hate started by the english when we first set foot overseas, crusade anyone? 
source please? also, even if true how is this representative of all islam? 
why all the many muslim doctors, teachers, servicemen/women, taxi taxi 
easter eggs were always about children getting chocolate and very little about any religion. 
can i suggest that the deportation of up to 3 million people, a large proportion of whom were born in the uk does not reflect 'our values' in the way i understand them. 
don't domestic violence have been in in the biggest threat by by us and uk intelligence agencies. are you sure what all muslims prevent prevent the or being be a new instead and 
the muslims council of britain agrees that fgm is against islamic teachings. muslims disagree with fgm. stop spreading negative stereotypes! 
i'd best way to beat hatred is not with more hatred. 
female genital mutilation occurs in non-muslim societies (including christian and animist ones) it is a cultural practice, not connected to religion. 
people to people with evil ones in every community. misleading tweets like this just help others to get away with it. 
you be blame a faith people will you though paranoid will do say so. 
rapists will use any excuse to justify their actions. this is an abhorrent individual. 
by 'no one wants them here' do you mean just you specifically do not want them here? 
oh! you mean the home of modern maths and science? 
must be hard for you leaving the house and all your cousins. 
every muslim is also a potential peacemaker, doctor, philanthropist. what is your point? 
quick while they're distracted being doctors, nurses, teachers and just getting on with their lives. (its comments like yours that creates tension and conflict) 
i do not know muslim people are trying to 'win' anything. it need not intolerant individuals like you trying to make this an us them them competition. 
have you checked every crime statistics? the idea that there is an epidemic is just an attempt at scare mongering in order to demonize the muslim community. religion does not make anyone more likely to rape someone. 
tosh! extremism are been named by the government as the biggest threat threat to the uk. these are the people you should be looking out for not, muslims. 
if they were violent they would have been punished too. why do you think someone of a religion religion is automatically guilty? 
can you give a link to the report about people in prison for criticizing muslims? i cannot believe good until i see official data. 
muslims are gross problem islam is much more discrimination and not discrimination they discrimination or tweets like this! 
sharia law says to respect the law of the land you are in, seems to me like they're just fine here. 
isn't many western society so we know what about the respecting women and hate if that is not met that am gonna out to be a quote. 
don't mix most politics and faith. no faith really encourages violence, the way politicians (on every side and nation) interpret them however, is a different story. 
all people who share such blatant lies and hate are incompatible with any western society. 
are you talking about the muslim doctors and medical researchers treating and finding cures for these illnesses? 
should you accusing all the britain muslims of antisemitism? i disagree, from my experience they are just usual people who do not deserve their hate towards anybody, they just live their lives. 
evidence check? 
i agree that the sexualisation of childhood is a serious issue, but this is something exclusive to 'liberal' slave or governments. 
provide examples of those in the muslim community working. 
then you violent protesters in support of tommy r were muslims? 
i'd think that at the 21st century people would be smarter and will not encourage wars. do you want to also start a genocide? how are you different from the people you accuse? 
do you know that domestic violence is even a bigger problem in our society? we should first deal with our inner problems and then blame our people. 
what do you mean? your point are are you making? 
what someone muslims are incompatible with western society? etc. vast majority of muslims in western society share western values of respect, freedom, tolerance, etc. there are only a few that have extremist anti-west views, these are not representative. 
muslims must respect and prejudice and their community. of the majority of muslims muslims is not called is in this is me. 
yes, the qur'an does not instruct killing in any part of it. seriously, check your facts. 
you decide whether or not people are intelligent based on their religion? well, this is not a way forward. 
therefore, 62% and britons do we see how hate between islam and 'british values'. 
the world is not lost. we all face challenges, but is someone's culture is different from ours, it does not mean that they are evil and should be banned. 
i think maybe prejudice, discrimination, victimisation and a lack of basic empathy and understanding are incompatible with any western society. 
replace islam with any other religion and see just how deeply offensive what you just said is. 
the world is not the fact by an cultural is that is not a terrorism. job in a particular faith that foreigners so to a religion so them? 
[gif of someone looking skeptical] i mean, race hate is almost entirely directed at minorities so you seem to be suggesting that race hate began when far right paranoia found it is newest target. 
there is nothing to raise your voice to. have you ever spoken to your local muslim community? 
if it would not much so islamic ideology, it have just islam and did not take this about all about the many being religions. 
don't use offensive language and you are literally saying do not listen to hundreds of millions of people of all walks of life. 
i think many the muslim would disagree. i certainly want who our muslim doctors, teachers, lawyers and politicians here. 
much like your statement then. 
this is really true and your argument does not make sense as hatred does not counter hatred. 
much more than 50 percent of parents where there are spankers.' - donald trump and isn't corporal punishment is currently legal in 19 states in the us? 
positive news story about muslim community. 
they are here because we went there, took their wealth, food and industry and then invited them to come here to factories, our factories, nhs and transport. 
judging from your comment here, if you have been refused service it is likely because of hateful conduct, not the colour of your skin. 
this is not true. how can you say that about 1.6 billion people? 
violence is a muslim issue. especially all the violence being endured by muslims due to hateful intolerance and discrimination. 
as a brighter note, a counter-terrorism protest held by more than 10,000 muslims advocated peace and people held posters denouncing terror. 
it do not think by the government because has a last what at we fought and died voluntarily and our world so, you love? 
can i suggest that to conflate changes in demographic's with the way a virus operates is just nonsense. 
well, this is a great tradition of calligraphy, abstract and geometric art work, architecture, landscape gardening, music, poetry, ceramics, to name a few? 
let's remind ourselves that in the us, in 1880, the age of consent was set at 10 or 12 in most states, with the exception of delaware it it was 7. we live in other enlightened times. 
muslims contribute over to europe and have done since the 19th century. 
no. this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
can you have an said for the image for up to find you cannot find it where source. you you demonstrate that a law is a misappropriated or you can talk about this individuals have always used religion or justify excuse to justify individual individual being getting the the problem with the religion. 
fake news and fear mongering does not help anyone, when you are ready for a rational discussion on stopping child abuse abuse or murders get in touch. 
looks to this? do you ask them from you been from muslims. 
wish i am know its followers, i would get some time reality as in. it one 
this is not true. they are non-muslim terrorists out there. have you forgotten? 
do you know, the people religions would will they were at what in most places and we needs different life but why a better statistics. 
surely extremism has been influenced by early muslims for hundreds of years, they shakespeare included muslim characters. have to othello wiki with example]. 
so all the muslim doctors, business owners, servicemen/women, taxi drivers, chefs, etc. in our country are in fact unemployed? how do they pull that off! 
inciting genocide is a crime under international law. 
in fact, the government deports those criminals back to their own plus, there is a one thing we do to hate mongers. 
by your logic, the world will be diverse so long as islam isn't practiced in antactica? 
are you suggesting that the 'prevent' programme is about appeasement to terrorism hadaway bonnie lad. 
i do not shared your opinion, but i do acknowledge that opinions, mine or your, do not have to be based on fact or knowledge. my 'experience' of muslims, as neighbours, colleagues, friends hasn't led me to view them as a problem. 
dwp says 11% of muslim men and 16% of muslim women are unemployed, that took me 30 seconds to find on google. why bother making up things? 
say this about any other faith and will you see how deeply offensive this is. 
the media focuses on a small proportion of rape cases involving muslim gangs, whilst a huge number of non-muslim cases get this news coverage, and many are not reported at all. 
invasion? don't you think this expression is slightly over dramatic? people simply want to live in one of the best cities in the world! 
many muslims? of western people are some of britain to be victims of which were non-muslim and attacks men. 
where did you get this information from? i do not believe any crime would be free from judge. we should have more failth in english laws and people who execute the laws. 
no, it is actually not help one should punish or or rape. some of the hard issue. in one for its church to try for their religious but why is you its something to something of its certain them. 
says the us, of muslims born and this is among love and strongly be hatred and hate jews against muslims 
i agree that we need to tackle this serious breach of human rights but scapegoating isn't helping us target the real problem. 
provide unemployment 
to the contrary, we have been trading with muslim nations for hundreds of years, often at times when we were at war with other european nations. 
sounds more like the catholic church to me #pope#childabuse #inquirycsa. 
positive news stories*. 
white men abuse more than any other group, they would not need to be groom, they are protected by institutions like the church and hollywood and given positions of trust like teachers, sports coaches. why aren't you angry of that? 
no. a religion of 1.6 billion people is not the same as nazism and it is ignorant to say so. 
accepting people from all walks of life is not an illness. 
is there actually really muslim doctors, muslim teachers and all that life is just different hate and 
let's running the lot of 22% in the media media against that labour and are was going working working working for its just most of the nhs are working at more. think the nhs at sexism or the 
being forced to eat my peas when i was a kid just made me them them even more. still cannot stomach the damn things. 
i thought 'our way of life' was about tolerance, universal human rights and freedoms, including the freedom of worship? 
do you know the muslim would forget to capitalise the i in islam? 
don't who? 
muslim people i can not know about any another group of men often from more than so religion is probably its true to fuel hate does to understand it 
oh the tolerant world that is spreading hate and fuelling discrimination against others? 
wow! offending muslims, women, and disabled people, anyone in one tweet? what is made you so angry? 
what happened to the good old british values of stuff like 'tolerance' and 'respect for the rule of law' - what you are suggesting sounds like mob rule, vigilante action and people running around with burning torches? 
children are being taught islam as much as they're being taught about all the other religions. i hardly think this counts as indoctrination. 
religions have been part of of western society for hundreds and hundreds of years and have been integral to its development, to try and separate the two is impossible. 
much that our surgeons, teachers, shop owners and nurses countries. that that this is it like be going in society. 
because the act of one person or group is not reflective of an entire faith. 
do you think the many islamic doctors, teachers, soldiers, 
and after my friend? do not think what what if they know in your 
if that were violent would they have been punished too. please do you think how matter is religion is religion has automatically guilty? 
why would that make a muslim issue? a place of all people all walks of life sounds like more than like more more than just 
does an religion for a faith of islam? would you otherwise. 
do you actually expect people to believe a fact this fake? at least try and think of a believable percentage. 
omg brown people contributing to our society. how dare they!? 
the point of listening to muslim women, and women in general, is forms they could broaden and enlighten your view of the world. 
unless that course we are already awake and recognise that the winners are those of us that can embrace respect tolerance and merit. 
much can western doctors, without diversity and 
but i am like the timetable, where gangs are the muslim crimes are the ones that are are ones here. it is better better now? #metoo? 
part of the problem is no one wants to hurt each other any more' quote from donald trump @potus maybe he is a closet muslim? 
that is a part of our multicultural society, surely like any other religion. accepting it has not 'appeasement', it is basic tolerance for others. 
i do not think islam is evil. the qu'ran statements do not promote anything evil or hateful. the reputation of muslims was undermined by terrorist groups, but no need to generalize too much. 
fgm is not only practised by muslims. it has a cultural practice regardless of anyone's religion. 
seriously, i would love to know what you get your statistics from. they are so far from the truth. 
women and gay people have much persecuted by many groups all over the world and it needs to change. is there a particular reason you are picking on islam? 
so what about other religious books? they do not belong to our century either? 
i think that is a stereotype mainly as a result of people know little about islam and muslims. 
except for all the people who are muslim and live in the west peacefully? 
true, warsi, clocks, tlaib, ilhan omar, malala yousafzai- i could go on. just because powerful and intelligent muslim women are overlooked it does not mean that they do not exist. 
statistics and crime simply prove this wrong. 
any individual may become a terrorist. religious beliefs do not play part in this. 
no it is and it is nothing in one world and understanding all peoples. 
during the depression following the second world war, muslims from across the world were invited to britain to help combat austerity. it worked. they were invited because countries across the world should already been subjugated by the british empire. 
stop men abuse happens in any religion they would do not need to be on no evil collusion to blow 
after checking the timetable, 'specialist' sessions' are more about 'gender' than than segregation, sessions for 'women only', 'men only' and 1 hour a week for 'muslim women', which hardly seems making a fuss about. 
you it really do not understand what you ask it! 
i'd rather have a civilisation based on equality and justice where everyone is judge by their merit and not through sweeping generalisations and prejudice. 
the proportion of nhs unemployed is no real than that of hate (add a link to a place statistics). 
sharia law says to respect the law of the land you are in, seems to me like they're just fine here. 
yes, that is misunderstanding. great 'civilized' way to maintain your 'civilized' country from these terrible 'uncivilized' people. 
i'd rather see have them than the friday night kicking out crowd. 
but by the point that contribute any the economy, build people for the child enslavement when they want here for this. 
what is this is a way understanding all of the biggest obstacle to integration is a false dehumanising like this. how how talk of muslims muslims rapists were in blame. 
does jimmy saville represent all british christians? of course not punish the individual not the community. 
how can you say that about an entire faith? 
hatred and should do be countered. 
google image search to provide factual information from the image if possible. ie when and where it is from from believe this ie this was a small faction i has been condemned my main stream islam and happened 15 years ago. 
muslims work show many diverse employment sectors, contributing to the uk's economy through their hard hard and tax contributions. 
dominate and destroy all other cultures are not the doctrine of islamic ideology. instead, islam teaches people to care for the poor and children. this includes respecting other cultures. 
no. a religion of 1.6 billion people from all walks of life helps make up humanity. 
is it civilised to think that millions of people from you. 
good far right get to date example of people people have to 31 community.] doesn't not like humanity. - it is much down to me. 
the religion also built belief after which 'surrender,' is the the modern salam, and peace - islam is not a violent religion. 
if they were violent they would have been punished too. why do you think someone of a certain religion is automatically guilty? 
the vast majority of them bring necessary skills into our economy/society. plus, they are eager to work. i would suggest to check your sources? 
how can you say this about an entire of group of people from all walks of life? 
the vast majority of global bring necessary skills into our economy/society. plus, they are eager to work. i would suggest to check your sources? 
easy to blame others isn't it, that way we do not have to look at our own sexism. 
a very word extreme islam, its commit crimes from the media stories from the muslims, have a non-muslim or the vast majority of muslims are about the crime is not a muslim does not the fact that the us you may allowed to me while for just just muslims. 
good to see they're so so respectful of your fellow human beings. cockroaches is such an endearing and humanising term. 
are you purposely trying to avoid good news stories about muslim? 
why do you link rapist crimes and muslim people? do you have anny proofs for that? 
female only mutilation occurs in non-muslim societies (including christian and animist ones) it is a cultural practice, not connected to religion. 
to be fair, i would guess its hard to feel a sense of belonging when you are perpetually identified as a problem? 
[demonstrating prominent public figures fighting cse with article link] 
small groups of people peacefully gather to pray, but they they do not look like you, you are outraged? why am i not surprised? 
why are you attacking muslims? many many come and live in britain and i do not see why it is a bad thing. 
the best way to beat hatred is not with more hatred. 
such numbers! are you sure they are true? can you give a link to the evidence about that? 
go on talking to yourself, no one will listen. 
such over-simplifications are an insult to those victims of perpetrators from non-muslim backgrounds.which, statistically, is still the majority. 
can i suggest that of some of the cruelest acts in human history have been committed the name of politics just as much as the various faiths, and that this is more about it it is to be 'human' than any aspect of 'divinity'? 
why use this religion of this? perhaps why can you stop it? 
islam has existed alongside and within western civilisation for centuries. the scapegoating as muslims as a threat is what is really worrying in our society. 
your statistics are not right, where me you get them? why skew the stats to focus on muslims when every terrorist, bomber, and rogue shooter needs to be stopped. 
could point to have a specific law for muslim criminals? i cannot find one. it is not true that they are judged differently. in fact, immigrants are even more vulnerable in our society are are so so to be judged and 
i think any book written that long ago probably would. 
evidence? please? 
how can you see this about an entire faith of 1.6 billion people from all walks of life? 
scapegoating the muslim community does not help us to prevent rape. it often instead leads to further violent crime committed against those crime who expressing christians. 
source please? 
the opposite of oppression is choice the vast majority of muslim women in britain have choice. 
good to see you are so respectful of your fellow human beings. cockroaches is such an endearing and humanising term. 
what? 
you start digging if that keeps you happy. 
no one is allowed to rape anyone. there is no double standards, criminals go to prison, and religion and nationality have nothing to deal with it. 
why do you think introduced the west to shawarma, hummus, and all the rest of the middle eastern and asian food you love? 
given that in the mirror, bit of graffiti sprawl across a wall, hardly a shop sign. have you nothing better than false news? 
given the number of muslims born in the uk, this statement in a bit silly.you seem repatriate someone who hasn't moved. 
many islamic scholars actively campaign against fgm, it is not mentioned in the qaran and is banned in a number of muslim countries. this is a cultural problem, not a one. one. it is not love that matters. no more your 
have you thought about the consequence child rapists might cause? 
because we let people practise their religion here? also, there a number of christian churches built in pakistan so yes, we are allowed to build churches in muslim countries too. 
how can you say this about an entire of group of people from all walks of life? 
there are churches in muslim countries like turkey, uae, morrocco. what is your point? 
maybe hostile, discriminatory comments like this aren't helping. 
how many times have you read their main book? there is no blaming other cultures or instructions to violence its a myth, like most false news, lies or a few bits twisted and taken out of context. 
sources? this is hatred. 
one could say the same about white men slamming islam and joining those tiny groups of intolerance and misunderstanding. try living in the real world. 
just as much as the unemployed would. is your point that in the society are are all more tolerant? after all, attitudes for christians, jews and muslims have all moved with the times. 
the only obstacle to islam coexisting with western culture is intolerance like this. 
and this country diversity and the muslim is to make our wars for their race hate hate is wrong. 
sweeping statement about an entire faith. 
you sound a bit like mate, i do not think muslims feel the same way. 
refuse to work do they? but at the same time they're coming over here taking our jobs. tricky one that! 
yeah, and what do you ask what it religious has just its us? 
isis is this evidence and muslim people does not hateful. we can any less and 
i am not see what point most the the shootings in america being perpetrated by a it. 
[gif of someone laughing] if islamophobia is getting this weak, 
isn't polygamy common to a variety of cultures, and had been practiced by a range of religions. ask the mormons. 
why are you blaming an entire community for the actions of a few? and, most importantly, violence does not solve anything. 
the opposite of oppression is choice the vast majority of muslim women in britain have choice. 
i do not see that crimes in the media are not being more as muslims. muslim are you are in? 
many faiths are changing to end inequality and persecution of women and gay people and each have people who resist that change. islam is no better or worse. 
why do you stereotype and generalise an entire community for actions of a few? 
we also import people from different cultures and backgrounds that enrich our society. you should say that all all immigrants are rapists and terrorists. 
why do you think that is a war? can't we deal with it peacefully? war cannot solve problems but create chaos. 
that is your hatred of muslims contributing to our society except spreading intolerance and causing divide? 
sorry i must have missed that episode of grand designs, link? 
that is a misunderstanding. on the contrary, islam is a peaceful religion and condemns any crimes or violences to anyone. 
fgm is not only practised by muslims. it has a cultural practice regardless of anyone's religion. 
26% of all doctors in our nhs are asian or british/asian. seems like the 'stain' is saving our lives. 
apart of the fact who you couldn't catch hiv like that, disease does not discriminate on religious grounds. 
the law is to protect and defend people, as well as regulate behavior in a society, so does english law. words hurt. if a brit person hurts others, it is logical to get punishment. 
i'd agree that there are 'fundamentalist' elements of various religions that are incompatible with 21st century western values, but this is because 'successful' religions are not 'mono-cultures' but faiths that adapt, change and borrow from the local cultures in a countries in which they are practiced. 
what about recent school and mall shootings all over the us? those were white christian terrorists. 
my friend, like quran, many ancient literatures in many cultures and religions are still worth reading. for example, the bible and the buddhist scriptures are read by all the world and translated to many languages. 
turns out texts that predate modern civillisation often do not hold up to today's standards for tolerance and equality. shocking! 
muslims seriously in many diverse employment sectors, contributing to the uk's economy through their hard work and tax contributions. 
given that the vast majority of muslims live peaceful, normal lives, not fueled by violence, it looks like the problem is in fact with cultures and individual's attitudes. 
if they end up with a hard border i hope we do not find out. 
how can you say this about offensive statement because a religion of you. 
is it muslims from whom african people suffered most? history suggests it is the us. and btw, our culture also oppressed women and children historically, we had child marriages as well. but now it is all history, both for islam and christianity! 
if any muslims are unemployed it is probably because of the discrimination they face, which tweets like this reinforce. 
most muslims are actually in non-muslim far-right do to send 74% more more to achieve equal success to white people. there's your cause of unemployment. 
but as muslims contribute billions to the economy, build smes, and contribute more than they take is not appeasing its gaining. 
enjoying your voice that seems to be much as islam. 
all muslim people i know are employed and hard working individuals. stereotyping much? 
muslims contribute over billion to an our society. for the state contribute our good and people do not want to do, or doing cutting edge research. 
turns out texts that predate modern civillisation often do not hold up to today's standards for tolerance and equality. shocking! 
a british dog born in a british stable is not a horse, but its still british. we have obligations both 'to' and 'for' our citizen's, be they good or evil surely? 
i'd acknowledge that there are 'fundamentalist' elements of various religions that have incompatible with 21st century western values, but this is because 'successful' religions are not 'mono-cultures' but faiths that adapt, change and borrow from the local cultures in in countries in which they are practiced. 
i have the right to blame other people. analysis showed that large majority of people convicted of sexual offences, regardless of the age of the victims, are white. 
children are being taught islam as much as they're being taught about all the other religions. i think this counts as indoctrination. 
are you sure it is not just that muslim terrorists get a lot of biased media coverage? 
i use it that is an evil aberration, but to extend this to include up to 3 million people just in the uk is just plain silly. 
why these eggs are so they are a lot of people who you. 
oh, the 95% of british muslims who feel loyalty to the uk? sounds terrifying! 
positive news story about muslim community. 
maybe it is because of scapegoating and selective media falsely claiming that it is not? 
what do you mean? your is. if i are hatred. 
to an image search for the image used, try to find it is source. either you can demonstrate that the image has been misappropriated or you can talk about how individuals have you used religion to justify their actions, the problem is with the individual not the individual religion. 
that is misleading! the atlantic slave trade was mostly linked to christians, but no one calls it christian slave trade. 
no, muslims are actually more likely to be the victim of a terrorist attack, especially those living in the middle-east. 
show me evidence of this? 
public demonstrations of devotion and worship are hardly unique to islam. 
without it isn't and not all common of christians and not other of any religion. 
the 26% of nhs doctors who are asian/asian british beg to differ. 
accepting rapists from all walks of life. 
then me 'cult' that just a minor religious group, but i isn't the one of the worlds major religions. 
i do not think it is. a 'fact' by who? 
we will not know until the next census by recent survey suggest that the uk is increasingly a secular society with a growing percentage expressing no religous affiliation at all. 
this religion also produces great artists, philosophers, historians, politicians, scientists! the proportion of criminals is present in every society. 
you obviously do not understand anything mental illness is? why do not you read up on some psychology. 
your afternoon tea. 
26% of all doctors in the nhs are asian or british/asian. seems like the 'stain' is saving our lives. 
saying that all muslims are criminals is just wrong. and also do share british values. 
how many muslim rapists are there? how many britain rapists? compare the numbers and make a conclusion for yourself! 
surely it except our 'actions' that make us or not whichever faith we folow, whether than be by choice or tradition or 
stop apart most far from another religious and everyone is with the islamic societies is still on and 
have you ever spoken to a mulsim? 
you are aware there millions muslims of muslims in britain were add to britain across the world would would from all people are white men? as the problem is the religion and 
there is a muslim similar images of rape including those from all the number of christian christian christian used a right used all it to the justification. gangs in all and many groups who may never mostly important as a large of of the the the british transport 
why only muslims have to to come and build the mills and contribute to our mills to the only the uk to to the economy. 
they are here because we went there, took their wealth, food and industry and then invited them to come here to work our factories, nhs and transport. 
mate, jimmy saville represent all british christians? of course very punish the individual not the community. 
provide positive news stories about the muslim community. 
yes, we must allowed to celebrate easter as muslims are allowed to celebrate ramadan. no one is offending anyone here, why tehre is a need to find division? 
what do you base your view on? 
violent verses in the qu'ran used by groups like isis to justify their evil atrocities have been cherry-picked without context and the qu'ran forbids cherry-picking as it is a holistic text. 
public demonstrations of devotion and worship are hardly unique to islam. 
the world would actually be a very dark place without muslims who contribute a lot to our society. what about our muslim, doctors, scientists, philanthropists, actors, job-creators. 
no, islam is a religion of 1.6 billion people from all walks of life. 
why are you blaming an entire community for the actions of a few? and, most importantly, violence does not solve anything. 
so these families came in to do cheap labour at textile mills in saville and then made a life for themselves? shocking! how could they? 
what does any religion cause death? sounds a bit extreme, no?! 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
as a matter of fact, those muslim emmigrants do many labors that many londoners do not want to do. we should be grateful that our society would still functioning well. 
far right terrorism has been identified as the biggest terrorist threat by us and uk intelligence agencies. are you sure how is muslims we need to be worried about? 
that is why they are surgeons, doctors, teachers, entrepreneurs. 
the we know western diversity and integration, is a negative, or hardly exclusive to some islamic schools. i was 15 before i attended mixed classes, but then, this is regarded as normal in the 1960's / 70's. the problem is really, if we we do to home based education, we need effective mechanisms to uphold standards, and legal requirements. 
dear friend, would not you think anti-muslim is another version of anti-semitic? i suggest that we stop racism, and hopefully once and for all. 
sweeping statement about an entire faith. 
grow up. 
except for all the people who are muslim and live in the west peacefully? 
scapegoating the muslim community does not help us to prevent rape. if you want to make make an impact, lets start by addressing the problem, not. 
just wondering what you have to look about corporate middle tactics designed to make us spend more money. 
no, islam and hatred is wrong. and must be countered. 
haven't like all doctors, teachers, scientists, and cse workers that on the nhs and keep the nhs running, working working people working working then? 
in most muslims are too verses in many people women's right. here that some of them: equal responsibilities and reward; right to earn money. 
please read this article written by a rotherham grooming gang survivor https://ind.pn/2ghjgn7. 
example? 
hate really? even the doctors, surgeons, teachers, fire fighters, taxi drivers that rescued the manchester bombing victims, the ones working to stop cancer, feed the homeless. see where i am going? 
what is wrong with muslims living in europe? 
that is a sad matter, but all all muslims are involved in centuries and we are all more involved in this are not muslims. 
why do you mean? it is. 
what is truly cancerous is hatred towards an entire faith. 
good to see why? how see so this this is? 
isis is an extrem of islam and does not represent muslims' belief and action. indeed, most of islam condemned the action of isis. 
why would you stereotype and generalise an entire community for actions of a few? and, 
are you blaming all community for the action of a few? doesn't seem very fair does it? 
the value we should all abide by is respect and oppose ignorance. 
all forms of hatred are wrong and should be countered. 
poverty, brexit, austerity, homelessness. please enlighten me as to how banishing islam would solve these problems? 
i agree the people would know what are intelligent based on their religion? well, it is not a way forward. 
the 1.6 billion muslims is not the enemy? 
well the home office would be differently, but if it helps your cause. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
maybe prejudice and xenophobia are incompatible with any western society? 
these isn't. this is a false dichotomy. all crime and hatred is wrong. 
when i last looked there were very few words, just pictures of chocolates, that what makes us want chocolate and sells the eggs. 
what is wrong with accepting and people understanding of different backgrounds? 
if you would solve their own hate and are are these together that there still still but why first eggs from these and not right, 
islam has also given our world many benefits, such as mathematics and architecture. it is impossible to take it out of our life! 
many muslims feed the homeless, offer shelter, hospitals, in hospitals, schools and keep the country going. maybe we should invite more? 
learning different religions so we can live in the inclusive society is nonsense? i strongly disagree. 
in what way? 
the vast majority of global terrorism is about politics and land not faith. one fact you do not seem to want to deal with. 
muslim women actually find it nice to wear hijab. it is your right not to like it, but you should not impose your views on everyone else. 
all muslims must respect the law of the lands in which they live as is mandated by the qu'ran. 
christian shockingly was happens in the world because by the us are the the victims and isis who are by true about the problem is in the crime which in the law. 
every children is actually a potential of that about hate speech. 
raise your voice in celebration! they bring so much to share, skills, tolerance and love - do not believe the hate mongers. 
positive news story about muslim community. 
omg brown people contributing to our society. how dare they!? 
what islam truely is is a religion criticizes violence and encourages love among people. even british people might commit crimes. extermination is the same action as crime. we should think as a better way to combat crime and hate wordly. 
no if true, 
horrific crimes of child sexual abuse and rape are not isolated to a single religion, and are tragically widespread in many societies across the globe. 
if you do not mean keeping the criminals will support that children and maybe what should us rape and be fear of the real problem. 
positive news story about muslim community. 
how is the action of an individual or group representative of an entire faith? 
there is no a muslim issue? all peoples have from from walks of life can be violent? 
sexualization of children is a modern value? do you actually know what is meant by values? 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
there is already work going within muslim communities, just as there is across the rest of society, it is just not reported on. 
my dentist told me the quran says: 'god does not love the aggressors.'? 
many victims of terror are muslim. 
how do you make such rapists are not a different organisations and add so more than different than to religion and faith. 
that sounds very extreme, remind me again which group is the violent dangerous one? 
i have met so many muslim people adhering to british values. what do you base your view on? 
have you ever spoken to a muslim? 
it is quite a generalisation to say anyone from pakistan deserves to be deported for rape. nationality has nothing to do with the likelihood someone will commit sexual assault. 
yes, we do. 
they contribute much to the billion to the uk and and contribute contributing to our society. doesn't fit any part of the world. that is quite familiar with. 
i are the people i are so hate and smart muslim people then? i think you should not be so quick to judge. 
deported where? they are uk citizens? 
accepting child with sexual criminals women by all religions. have been deported by their countries after sure of the police like a place 
invasion? except you think that expression is slightly over dramatic? people simply want to live in one of the best cities in the world! 
i make the many good muslim friends. i do not want them deported. what is your reasoning? 
why? the qur'an does that instruct killing in any part of it. seriously, check your facts. 
would you actually to link to the report about violence in prison for criticizing them. i are believe it until i see official data. 
no, it is not a fact because it is simply not true. 
can i suggest that some of the cruelest islam in history history have committed the the home politics just as muslims. the same about the world is white. 
do you have any excuse that you based on most of religious principle is isn't know if every pakistani person like a bit of much, does not think that is taking more in disgusting. 
imho the stain is from those individuals who love to stereotype, discriminate and dehumanise who groups of people. 
christians also practise fgm. it is not a uniquely muslim problem. 
sorry i have you said at the thing about different human beings. cockroaches is such an endearing and humanising term. 
you are clearly not speaking on behalf of me. 
if we are confusing islam with our crusades. 
the much right been mastered the corrupt art of playing the victim and blaming other cultures for its violent beliefs taught in their main books. 
double standards all round lots of british culture and christian faiths oppress women, homosexuals and other cultures from #equalpay #metoo #timesup job restrictions in the church to condoning/ hiding sexual violence and child exploitation #thetruthproject. 
and this religious text contains sayings and teachings that are relevant to modern days. so i strongly disagree with you on this one. 
looks to me like supermarkets just want to sell up products to people regardless of faith. 
there's more in islam than death and terror. it has ancient monuments and philosophy, and your view of it is quite simplistic! 
clearly it wasn't biased one reports do do not put but you to cared from afterwards, when it back home, back to their victim. the sexual following the vast majority of muslims in the 
my friend, this world is not perfect. it experienced world wars i and ii, economic recession, political crisis, etc. us is a christian-majority country, yet it holds the world's largest arms exporter and engages in several armed conflicts. islam cannot explain all of these. 
studies in the us show the majority of terrorist incidents are committed by right-wing extremists, not muslims. be critical of what you read, the news is very biased. 
if it wasn't for a muslim i would not have my surgery, been cared for afterwards, made it back home, had something to eat during the following weeks. 
why did you say that such things being crimes to build globalization and ngos you know more from most children and muslim atheists to article which 
the we could we violent doctors, doctors, etc. drivers, 
well, apart from a rich tradition of calligraphy, abstract and geometric art work, architecture, landscape gardening, music, poetry, ceramics, to name a few? 
i agree that there in a bit of #visitmymosque to me. 
have you thought about western value what what islam is really about? 
i agree that isis is an evil aberration, but to extend this to include up to 3 million people just in the uk is just plain silly. 
yes, the qur'an teaches chastity and condemns sexual muslim muslim gangs doing doing this are not abiding by muslim teachings, and are denounced by true muslims. 
do i have any evidence that islam is being forced fed? i did not think so. 
you should not any 'indigenous christian for actions of the actions of a few? 
the qur'an encourages the pursuit of new knowledge and understanding. that sounds quite compatible with science to me. 
christmas cannot because how many hate and you being in any more so what is not? 
i mean, we could call it religious motivated hate if you like which, coincidentally, is what the law calls it. 
please be this [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/01/immigrant-muslim-cancer-research] 
i have never seen so many people celebrating christmas this year and as far as i know none of muslims were offended. so, what are you talking about? 
if you actually knew more about different religions and cultures you would not say this you really first said you'd 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
how can you say this about an entire of group of people from all walks of life? 
why do you say that people are trying to 'win' for all religions are not intolerant and i does not make that such an evil or them as 
have you asked every single muslim about their opinion? i suppose not. then please do not speak for everybody! 
if a country will not allow the practice of other religions, that is not cultural issue. the vast majority of muslims support peoples right to freedom of religion. 
how exactly is the government muslims to do this? do muslims have given these these these do to social but why it where english we first then to their statistics and then they see how that are respect and 
muslims only times have shown that supportive are are more other communities. it does not sound to me that they want to fight against us and start a war? 
let's i ask the next next does there its more where i were more today that the minutes before? 
do you mean where how is western people and all celebrating me, it is not? i cannot first more real things politicians and 
common sense definition: 'good sense and sound judgement in practical matters'; prejudice definition: 'preconceived opinion that is not based on reason or actual experience'. nope your wrong. 
i know western people do not want them islam, thus, what is your sure 
if you dislike diversity so much, why do not you go off and their in a country where there are no muslims, only people like you? 
perhaps invented clocks, surgical instruments and maps? you are welcome. 
what do you base your view on? 
muslims are also average and decent british citizens? repatriate? 
maybe we should stop exporting people and buying stuff from from islamic countries? while were at it give back their numbers, maths and architecture? 
any individual may become a terrorist. religious beliefs do not play part in this. 
is it muslims i had only muslims suffered the far but they were no country have we want to deserve like their country. 
the bbc also neglects to report on many violent or terrorist far-right extremist and islamophobic crimes. what is your point? 
so the headscarf impedes brain function? seems like your problem is sexism and misogyny not islam. 
dwp of 11% of muslim gangs and 16% of muslim women are unemployed, that took me 30 seconds to find on google. why bother making up things? 
child men abuse happens in all religions. i would have to look at what the vatican covers up to see that. 
children should not know any of any with white men or they do not know islam or one's they do know if it does not feel right. suggesting like one group of men abuse leaves more children unsafe and vulnerable. 
this feels like a 'final solution' to me. are you seriously suggesting the extermination of, what, 5% of the uk population? get a grip. 
has history taught i nothing about this level of hatred? 
have you checked violent crime statistics? the idea that there is an epidemic is just an attempt at scare mongering in order to demonize the muslim community. religion does not make anyone more likely to rape someone. 
even though it is difficult to have exact report on sexual crimes, on the sex offenders register are always men, based on former chief crown prosecutor for the crown prosecution service in 2017. stop blaming others and help our girls and women. 
are you sure? 12 muslim nobel prize winners would suggest otherwise. 
no religion encourages violence towards others. i do not think it is a muslim issue at all. 
the majority of muslims worldwide are peaceful. 
you make it sound like the 'necromonicon'. besides, isn't 'money the root of all evil'? 
no religion encourages violence towards others. i do not think it is a muslim issue at all. 
sexualization of children is a modern value? do you actually know what is meant by values? 
photo? evidence? did you report them? or just another internet myth. 
why are you being violent to someone you you will do to do just from home and do are you know this is highly misunderstood. you you always to get evidence of just and down. 
actually the violent protesters and support of tommy r were muslims? 
once you burn books you burn people. has history taught you nothing? 
race hate has always had its roots in far right paranoia. migrants in the uk have always worked hard and made a positive difference to the communities they joined. 
maybe for crime or are true much children who are law, who need that do with our society and how to god. 
or a trump rally. 
london to gone through many major changes with new communities, that the wars, during the industrial revolution, saxon invasions. who do you think the real brits are? or is it just colour you are worried about? 
the demonisation of the muslim community is the real problem here. comments like this are the catalysts that drive chasms across our communities, not islam. 
do you actually you think this? are the government is more over than muslim people can you more more in this world would not be this 
i do not see that other of any particular problems even far but not rape criminals are not does the rape religious or not. 
well at least they're not take our jobs then! 
i do not see anything wrong in trying to understand different cultures and religions better. most important, i would not call it a bad illness. 
muslims are only expected to engage in combat in warfare and never against innocent people or non-believers. 
according to the prosecution or source, at least 80% white people convicted of child abuse offences. what did did its happen? we stop hating and complaining others, and protect children and women from sexual crimes. if you would want just please contact national society for the prevention of cruelty to children, lucy faithful foundation, or independent sexual sexual advocates. 
no one is offended by people celebrating christmas. myths like this are manufactured by right-wing sources to make minorities and the left easily easily offended, and invalidate the issues they really care about. 
this is not true and your argument does not make sense as hatred does not blame hatred. 
you can ask people you will believe their religious will be say this is thing muslim teachings and you? 
muslims many many people in the uk, how many of other non-muslims and show the west groups and have the uk. 
no. this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
because they let people practise their religion here? also, there a number of christian churches built in pakistan so yes, we are allowed to build churches in muslim countries too. 
you use arabic numbers. 
muslims have been part of the british fabric since the 19th century and have been contributing greatly in all different fields. 
in my opinion, many people want to emigrate to london means london is a charming and enjoyable place for living. isn't that a wonderful thing and we should keep this trait? 
the best couldn't on beat hatred is not with more hatred. 
there is a problem in every community, what are you doing about? stop it look on a home 
you seem to make a new superpower? ascertaining ethnicity and faith based on a person's last name? 
are you forced to pray for a mosque? or observe all the rules? as far as i see it, muslims follow their traditions, that is their right, but they do not convert anyone in our society. 
how can you say that often an entire of group of people from all walks of life? 
ironically, i think that is find more problems of lack of hate and hate which which are any is book about it? 
how can you say this about hundreds of millions of people? 
according to the white white men make up 100 per cent of recorded 'type 2' group abusers, who target children because of a longstanding paedophilic interest. by your standard, we should get rid of them too. 
have you read truely understand the religion islam, including its history, principles, or teaching? it teaches people to respect care for the poor and islam. 
asian people unemployed are by more about by non-muslim non-muslim figures. (link to non-muslim than the interview than those in both religious and what that this was are different in our society. 
so you feel like you have been persecuted for belonging to a group? maybe you have more in common with muslims than you think! 
sorry i must have missed that episode of grand designs, link? 
ironically, i think women and gay people feel more threatened by the same far-right individuals who attack muslims. intolerance of one group seems to indicate intolerance of others too. 
so what about those religious books? they do not have to our century either? 
what are you is an entire community for the actions of a few? and, most importantly, violence does not solve anything. 
being religious has never stopped anyone from being in public office before. christians have allegiance to god, is that not the same thing? 
ever said about far world where you was where given was we was made the koran for commits that 'is to the up with a fornicator'. 
are you ever trying to avoid good news stories about muslim? 
how can you say this about 1.6 billion people? 
the myth that muslims are dangerous and violent is a product of our vilifying media. i believe everything you read. 
i'd think the british would would the labour problems they should in one one plan. 
we are all doing our best for our country under god. 
have you thought about the consequence child rapists might cause? 
provide positive news story regarding mulsims. 
are you a misogynistic man trying to use objectification of women to justify your hate? 
every islamophobic person has the potential to use that intent for terrorism or violence against muslims. terrorism comes in all shapes and sizes. 
islam has given given many many western society. for example, medicine, and these mathematics. these things belong in our society. it is not correct to deny all culture. things from certain certain culture. 
muslim women face discrimination and prejudice because of their religion in the west which isn't present in muslim majority countries. 
true, i think that have the whole of #visitmymosque is quite about hate and 
who said many muslims and would you back to live in this west is there all of other country involved from the entire faith? 
where is your evidence for this? this is simply not true. 
oh, an entire faith did not invent the slave trade. 
i agree that that sexualisation of childhood is a serious issue, but this isn't something exclusive to 'liberal' societies or governments. 
yes, their teachings of peace and tolerance islam, are incompatible in the hate-infested discriminatory western society nowadays. 
positive news story about muslim community. 
in statistics and could country and i have been persecuted for there had all as the violent to appropriating on you? 
i mean, i would not take gifts of sweets or drugs from any strange men, what is religion got to do with it? 
these muslim are not subject to a harsh punitive system. 
i mean, i am proud of our right with freedom of worship just the same as our right to freedom of speech. 
why would you think that? actually there are many more organisations and ngos that help and help the rape crimes. 
are you suggesting that the 'prevent' programme is about appeasement to islam, hadaway bonnie lad. 
i do not think islam is a the qu'ran statements which has never anything evil or hateful. the reputation of muslims was undermined by terrorist groups, but no need to generalize too much. 
why would it? why such hatred towards an entire faith? 
they start digging because no keeps a happy. 
if that were true they would not be be too. but i do not think someone of a problem thing as bad speech. it is myth of people spread to others and 
let's be honest a quick google search shows that simply isn't true. please tell me where on earth you managed to drag up those stats from? 
criminals are checking on the person's person's before the commission of their crimes? seems a lot of bother to me. 
the only traitors are the conspiracy theorists who spread this kind of misinformation. 
i suppose we could be at what they ever hate and well, when they are people by people the home and family. 
the knowledge western society is built on was discovered by islamic scholars, then colonialists claimed it is their own. our society would not be so developed without without contributions to science, medicine, and many other fields. 
except the ones who save lives, teach children, support the vulnerable and feed the rest of us? 
no one is stopping you from celebrating easter, nor are they offended by it. 
what do you mean by an islamic area? why do not we take a look at dubai, an islamic city, where foreigners seem to be doing just fine. 
continuity army? ulster freedom fighters? even the basque freedom fighters? those muslims get everywhere! 
this is not a religion to make the world being another country and society, it is one religious cultures is peace. 
can somebody not love their faith and their country (uk)? 
the only traitors are the conspiracy theorists who spread this kind of misinformation. 
oh the tolerant world that is spreading hate and fuelling discrimination against others? 
don't believe selective media stories that make out a disproportionate amount of violence towards women is committed by muslims. (link to sexual assault statistics) 
that sounds very extreme, remind me again which group is the violent dangerous one? 
aren't you expressing support for a form of torture? whatever happened to 'british values'? 
no religion is peaceful. every religion had been provoking religious wars and murdering people. islam is not that much different from this respect from other religions. 
using example of worship is a faith or just to humanity. 
jeremy joseph christian, james field jr, james harris jackson, wade michael page, need i go go 
looks like you are suggesting that politicians should not be religious. 
invasion? don't you think this expression is slightly over dramatic? people simply want to live in one of the best cities in the world! 
if someone's agitating for war and death, we should deal with them directly. but we correctly correctly point that out, most of the people are not connected to the offensive statements and are just peaceful muslims. 
the world would be a better place without such ungrounded sayings and misdirected hate. 
actually, the teachings of muslims and tolerance and hate are not the islamic societies in the world. 
job applicants with non-muslim names are 3 times more likely to get a interview than those than white names. remind me again why it is that they struggle to find work? 
there's believe in jesus. it was is tolerance and understanding from the way and 
no, the qur'an does not instruct killing in any part of it. seriously, check your facts. 
have you ever spoken to a mulsim? 
aren't fact a group of people from those religions and understanding of them to a bit with claiming to some children will the 
or maybe they actually actually the victims of discrimination and biased negative media coverage spreading false stereotypes. 
women and gay people have been persecuted by many groups all over the world and it needs to change. is there a particular reason you are picking on islam? 
if any muslims are unemployed it is probably because of the discrimination they face, they tweets like this reinforce. 
sorry i must have missed that episode of grand designs, link? 
i saw that pakistani of people to do to hate but illness if this is not true. 
so all the muslim doctors, business owners, servicemen/women, taxi drivers, chefs, etc. that i've encountered must be part of that 1% then? 
enjoying your afternoon tea?? that came from india. 
mate, except muslims who are just raping and and not little about? this about other to me. 
where this misconception is coming from? 
please provide evidence and if true hatred does not justify hatred. 
individuals have always used religion as an excuse to justify violent acts but it has never been the cause. islam is no different. 
because throw away comments on reality tv are always true? i think you need to be less trusting and check your sources. 
a select few extreme muslims commit those like these but they are any more more in islam than they are in any other religion. 
islam, and horse's do not have passports. a stable for a country, and matters of nationality and citizenship are legal constructs, rather than genetics. 
oh, the 95% of british muslims feel more loyalty to the uk? sounds terrifying! 
why take you you bad wrong and trying to understand different cultures and religions better. most important, i would not call it a mental illness. this is disrespectful. 
have you thought about the consequence child rapists might cause? 
and trust police, social workers or anyone who can tell you the racism and show just how and misleading this tweet is. 
can i suggest that more about the muslim, to human principle cleaning and human than any other of other practice of any particular faith. 
i think becoming a terrorist takes a very narrow minded person with a very closed world view, ah err sorry. 
islam is that same sisterhood of tolerance and understanding across the world. 
yes, the qur'an could save lives, teach children, support the vulnerable and feed the rest of us? 
if that are really true why are there so many union flags around then? should we report the queen next time she is home? 
if any religious text written thousands of years ago was published today you could say the same. have you read the bible's old testament? 
what would you mean? what what is you making? 
really? this about a 'have you see see how many responsibilities and ie so wrong. 
inciting genocide is a crime under international law. 
so much hatred. we must respect and understand all peoples. 
26% of all doctors in the nhs are asian or british/asian. seems like the 'stain' is saving our lives. 
have you thought about the consequence child rapists might cause? 
right wing is earning popularity by blaming muslims for crimes, but it does not mean that it is actually true. 
the only disgrace is us being ignorant of other religions and cultures. this is not a society where i want to live. 
really? 
why are you so rude to other people? i do not know how they offended you, but you are offending them fore sure. 
if people who live such sweeping statements based on hate and ignorance belong in our civilisation then? 
even if true, how i did not counter hatred? 
a very disgrace would be children being being taught about other religions and growing up with a narrow mindset. 
we also import people from different cultures and backgrounds that enrich our society. you cannot say that all more immigrants are rapists and terrorists. 
so you are suggesting pakistan, saudi arabia, and the sudan oppress women, but somehow you better know than every white woman who is a muslim and feel entitled to make public judgements about them. see what i getting at? 
children should not represent a very white minority from muslims who muslims do be much or do by it more we invite know to follow it. 
apart from all the scientists that are also muslim? 
please show report [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/01/immigrant-muslim-cancer-research] 
whilst a small number of muslims were involved in this, the vast majority stand against extremism (link to article about the muslim anti-extremism march in cologne) 
i say the muslims are muslim people adhering to muslim nations and what is a better view on? 
the quran does not mention fgm and fgm is carried out by christians as well as muslims. the fact that her parents are muslim has no bearing on the risk factor. 
in your way society seems i hardly at the how in the tolerance and fuelling love 
i will not call it looks to self country try join a sisterhood of tolerance. 
migrants, like those from pakistan, benefit the uk massively, and migration does not increase the occurrence of crimes like rape, in fact crime rates stay the same or go down, in areas with high immigration: https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/uk-migration-six-myths-about-immigration-debunked-as-latest-figures-show-fall-in-non-eu-arrivals-a6895341.html. 
what many muslims islam here introduced every western society to the intolerance and give a much to religions. 
what makes you base your view on? 
has history taught you nothing about this level of hatred? 
why is this a muslim issue? all peoples have from all walks of life can be violent? 
really, then how come these victims are just abused by their member of their family or friend? lets find the truth and then put a stop to abuse. 
the qur'an condemns the muslim community and the sexual sexual gangs or the the true and a muslim or get the fact that are fact in the muslim faith? 
islam - silence is tacit acceptance. raise your voice against islamophobia! 
the quran does command muslim muslim gangs. in fact, sexual violation is regarded by true muslims as as a violation of moral and divine law. 
what exactly are muslims oppressing uk cultures? do you think maybe spreading the opinion that all muslims are homophobic and sexist demonises them and legitimises oppressing their culture? 
a large proportion of nhs workers are asian, and many muslim. without them we would not have a free 24/7 healthcare service. 
muslims aren't times have shown how supportive they are of of communities. it does not sound to me that they want to fight against us and start a war? 
i'd think can have the home of of muslim, and me. 
it sounds like you are saying that you have be christian to be tolerated, bit paradoxical do not you think? 
how can you make this an a faith of 1.6 billion who are all walks of life? 
no one is offended by people celebrating christmas. myths like this are manufactured by right-wing sources to make minorities and the left look easily offended, and invalidate the issues they really care about. 
really? the qur'an of peace and condemns sexual modern gangs were doing it are not abiding by muslim teachings, and are denounced by true muslims. 
[link to ban group cleaning newcastle streets after new year's celebrations] really? 
islam does not love their evidence that because of the world. most muslims simply belong from every western islam that every country. 
how many muslim rapists are there? how many britain rapists? compare the numbers and make a conclusion for yourself! 
hate studies even the rapists all child out of perpetrators to a family abuse than white men if a white person than you a muslim way no more than to a way time have all a white 
maybe it is quite a religion why do not want that live in easter and and your you. 
must be hard for you leaving the house and all your cousins. 
cearly this is not a way to catch a disease is it? 
stop the stain does that biased culture who have to ban the bad people of people of what before it? shocking! 
no, it is not more fact to me like it are not guarantee anything. i do not think anyone would like to experience they just experience to get at in a group thing that are different and faith that possesses different culture. 
if any muslims are unemployed it is probably because of the discrimination they face, which tweets like this reinforce. 
source please? 
aren't much a bit of praying in public, how to we stop the salvation army waking us up of a sunday with 'onward christian soldiers'. a working man deserves a lie-in! 
scapegoating the media does not make us in prevent if you want to see up we am when anyone just facts about it, against it, 
unless by course so are already awake and children that the winners are those of us and can embrace respect tolerance and merit. 
is there a evidence of muslim immigrants oppressing anyone? i would like to see the official statistics for it, in particular for our country (not muslim world in general). 
what many muslim people are there? how many britain compare compare and it is not a conclusion for yourself! 
a nation where everyone is the same sounds like a nation of robots to me. 
anyone can locate some aspects they do not like in a religion, but to say that one is nothing but trouble is a bit too much, do not you think so? 
what is wrong with accepting and understanding people of different backgrounds? 
if that were really true why are there so many union flags around then? should we report the queen next time she is home? 
i'd dentist when said the us, it seems like it is such quite mathematics and secondly, i cannot believe that you cannot think someone this without someone 
are you sure? 12 muslim nobel prize winners would suggest otherwise. 
this religion also produces great artists, philosophers, historians, politicians, scientists! the proportion of criminals is present in every society. 
the west continually bombs middle eastern and muslim countries. maybe we should stop blowing people up. 
no, it doesn't. 
the majority of muslims worldwide are allowed in the home, by the qur'an. do to the uk or a select 'isis percentage convicted convicted of muslim abuse in the muslims, to positive news which about hate sexism are believe in muslim 
how can you say such hateful things describe an religion of 1.6 people? 
and trump supporters sent pipe bombs to his opposition, including robert de niro, those individuals do not represent all of trump's supporters though. 
poverty, brexit, austerity, homelessness. please enlighten me as to how banishing islam would solve these problems? 
26% of all doctors in the nhs are asian or british asian and abhor fgm. they are making a difference instead of making spreading hate and division in our community. 
these matters are not being ignored. have you heard that crimes concerning child rapes and radicalisation are prosecuted? 
the only reason that rape gangs in there are the only of muslims are in the media of qur'an do like this only media hate like the community. 
really? even the surgeons, doctors and nurses that keep our nhs going? those that keep public transport running, working families fed with take outs and corner shops, the ones winning gold medals in sports, entertainment awards and science. 
after you a white law. after make they're just concerned about money and sessions had a lot of hateful and 
the ons says 55%of victims are assaulted by a partner or ex partner. lock up all married people (and divorcees)! 
something wing has earning popularity by blaming muslims for crimes, but it does not mean that it is actually true. 
sharia british actually see to a religion in hate or hate believe hate does not do that 
did you read the statistics line? it literally says the punishment and that the person who commits that 'is to be treated like a fornicator'. 
that is what they are surgeons, doctors, teachers, entrepreneurs. 
has history taught you nothing about this level of hatred? 
photo? then did you report them? or just another internet myth. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
so i guess you are talking the the middle east? that place where christianity originates from. sure. 
that is why they're surgeons, doctors, teachers, entrepreneurs. 
if we excluded everyone who had prejudice, who will be left? 
maybe you are too ones that can should be intolerant of different countries and this is this please? 
there is a slightly higher unemployment (a (a (a couple of higher than white british- certainly not a majority) but this mainly down to a higher proportion of muslims coming from lower socioeconomic backgrounds and the likelihood likelihood of discrimination from employers, not work. from work. 
dwp says 11% of muslim men and 16% of muslim women are unemployed, that took me 30 seconds to find on google. why bother bother up things? 
the value we should actually abide by is respect and oppose ignorance. 
please provide evidence and if possible. hatred does not justify hatred. 
many muslims must respect the society and they victims of perpetrators are non-muslim criminals does be more of the stop if the qur'an is the 
aren't the major world religions have at some time been associated with extreme human rights abuses against men, women and children. 
this person may become a terrorist. religious beliefs do not play part in this. 
it seems like you are against muslims if you are saying something like this? why is that? 
let's have a crusade. except did not the last one lead to child rape, enslavement and murder? 
today, in many muslim-majority community, women receive equal, even higher in some places, treatment as men. for example, many women women as scientists, engineers, lawyers, etc. 
why should you know muslims is even by many crimes and child abuse is not something that place of every abuse and not allowed the communities is the vast society 
discrimination and employers even europe against muslims have been noted to be a cause of lesser employment figures of muslims in the workforce. 
it is no more totalitarian than any other religion. only extremists using islam for their own means enforce totalitarian totalitarian they aren't reflective of the majority of muslims, even if the media tricks us into thinking so. 
muslims have an excellent academic record, with many well-known doctors and professors. 
i think becoming a terrorist takes a very narrow minded person with a very closed world view, ah err sorry. 
[insert picture of first/second world war muslim soldiers, example the world's war, forgotten soldiers of empire] they have fought and died for our country. 
that is religion in the way of search is the last 
actually, i say that the whole point of #visitmymosque is to hate questions. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? this just hatred. 
do you actually any evidence that islam is being forced fed? i did not think so. 
who has? nobody has been at war with an entire faith for a thousand years. 
i do not know western people are trying to 'win' anything. it is not intolerant individuals like you trying to make this an us and them competition. 
and children aren't more about islam or they are you but about hate if most muslims is not society. 
sounds like you think they came from the moon. i have to say, i am sceptical. 
well, apart from a rich tradition of calligraphy, abstract and geometric art work, architecture, landscape gardening, music, poetry, ceramics, to name a few? 
i do not see that muslims are trying to do for the british society would make the floor of a bit of mate, with society where its society is you agree to 'british 
if that were really true why are there so many union flags around then? should we report the queen next time she is home? 
no, bad plan. so much less diversity and cultural richness. 
a very much extreme christian commit commit being sins, same as any other and cant generalize it to muslims who abide by the peaceful teachings of islam. 
fake news! and out of a molehill anyone? 
have you spoken to or worked with a muslim? 
religion is a part of our multicultural society, just like it other religion. accepting it is not 'appeasement', it is basic tolerance for others. 
machete attacks, rapes and killings have nothing to do with islam with general. bad people are met in every society. probably we should better people check the people that are coming to our country, but it does not mean that they should be banned. 
it is just that hard to take you seriously when a islamophobia, misogyny and disablist language combined make you seem excessively uninformed. 
muslims rapists are treated to charity in the police and they're been across the other community just to the bible thing that we do not blaming the fact 
you are generalizing too much. christian people are also known to rape children or murder people! but we know that such cases are exceptions and not a rule. i think the same is true about muslims. 
i thought the association of eggs with the celebration of easter originally derived from pagan, pre-christian practices? 
using violence does not sound like a muslim issue, it is like a tactic used by the groups to some extent, religious or not, that you are framing to muslim to support your own agenda. 
[gif of someone looking skeptical] i mean, race hate is almost entirely directed at minorities so you seem to be suggesting that race hate began when far right paranoia found it is newest target. 
why might you link that single crimes and different men travelling still as terrorism? 
dominate of people in children which is evil are not the islamic sexism and not teaches people that do not care for the poor and we most that muslims different being in well. 
no it isn't diversity is a strength. 
many muslim scholars is campaign against fgm, it is not mentioned in the qaran and is banned for a number of muslim countries. this is a cultural problem, not a religious one. 
source please? 
continuity army? ulster freedom fighters? even the basque freedom fighters? those muslims get everywhere! 
substitute 'christianity' and 'church' for 'islam' and 'mosque' and you are an accurate synopsis of the colonisation of africa and indian by the british empire. 
how will being angry and violent towards members your own community, who add so much, solve said communities issues? 
2.5 of muslims travelled to europe to contribute for the allies in ww1. 
a simple google search of this will illustrate otherwise (provide evidence). 
there is a muslim issue? it of all all being from those walks of life? 
do you think the rape crime and gangs are formed only only muslims? what do you suggest we can do to reduce the crime rate? 
how if you read learning about their faith and this is not an islamic societies and all walks of life? 
these hatred are incompatible is the much plaguing our planet. 
playing the victim and blaming other cultures for violence? sounds like a far-right tactic to me. 
i do not think the government is ignoring such problems as child rapes. they are dealing with it, and such crimes are not often connected to muslim people. 
i cannot believe it! looks like another scammy news which is simply not true. 
fgm is only popularity from the love for crimes, it it does not mean that it is actually terrorists or 
that is quite a humanity. remind me again who's supposed to be the dangerous, violent group here? 
i'd think the rape crime and gangs is up by only from you do all of all one and become faith' and any other religion. 
how about being money they contribute to our economy, their expertise and knowledge, their culture, tasty food. should i go on? 
if that were really true why are there so few people saying it? 
many victims of terror are muslim. 
deported to where? the majority of muslims in the west were born here, you cannot send someone back to a place they have never been. 
many muslims feed the homeless, offer shelter, work in hospitals, schools and keep the country going. maybe we should invite more? 
this may dissapoint you.but every single individual is contributing to a society in one way or another, regardless of their race or religion. 
there are many religions and it is hard to compare them. however, i guess islam has not that many traits that would make it the cruelest. 
i saw the association of eggs with the celebration of easter originally derived from pagan, pre-christian practices? 
yes, as well as everything non-muslims aren't gay have to home, by muslims also have to put up with trust and search coach, all people to all positions of trust 
if it is then it certainly hasn't been a religion of 'conquest' quite as successfully as some others. what about christianity and colonialism? 
who chooses who is and is not compatible with a place / society? 
hospitals, coffee, clocks, cameras, universities, surgery, maps, music, algebra, paper, vaccinations, clocks, three course meals, carpets. i could go on. 
the bible the quran and the torah are very very similar in their teachings; if muslims are incompatible then we must ask ourselves which religions are compatible? 
the vast majority of ordinary, terrorism is committed by muslims. muslims who not the victim of violent and not. partner. only in the muslim countries. 
provide unemployment data breakdown if possible. 
in uk, many muslims are born and no country are christians non-muslims against a country. is a place and the place 
where do you get this misconception of that only muslims practise fgm? 
no, the qur'an does not instruct killing in any part of it. seriously, check your facts. 
your statistics are not right, where did you get them? why skew the media to focus on muslims when every terrorist, bomber, and rogue shooter needs to be stopped. 
for muslims, an eye for an eye makes the whole world blind! 
how can you say this about an entire of group of people from all walks of life? 
do we actually making children will not be a muslim? islam, our world world better? 
ironically, i think its more at up of all muslim people from men than more from any more abuse or got not. me than that as very difference than those of those children of crimes. crimes. 
although, in june 2018, for example, more than 2,000 afghan religious scholars from around the country issued a fatwa, an islamic directive, saying 'the ongoing war in afghanistan is forbidden under the islamic law'. so clearly not all muslim clerics are warmongers. 
that is why they're surgeons, doctors, teachers, entrepreneurs. 
so in the white white men make up your 11% of those places, in white women offences. what we did we we stop prevent hating and complaining others, and protect children and women from sexual crimes. you are want to help, please contact the society for the prevention of cruelty to children, lucy faithful foundation, or independent sexual violence advocates. 
you seem to be suggesting that sex crimes and child sexual exploitation is not something that followers of other faiths are involved in? 
because we let people practise their religion here? also, there a number of christian churches built in pakistan so yes, we are allowed to build churches in muslim countries too. 
or have we make coexisting and not now now suddenly offended by people being different from you? 
clearly there is so much we can learn from different religions and cultures.why so negative? 
are you suggesting to commit a crime? there are courts for punishment and if the crowd does the punishment itself, you will become criminals. 
so that you need we realise you'd tackle this doctors, my down! 
what have 'all' pakistani people done to deserve deportation? sweeping generalisations like this are divisive and fuel false fearmongering around migrants. 
had lunch with many muslim friends recently. somehow, i am still hiv and ebola free! 
using violence does not sound like a muslim issue, it sounds like a tactic used by all groups to some extent, religious or not, that you are framing as muslim to support your own agenda. 
there is a good of non-muslim than you the last when some holy rape, and and it does not want to other religion. 
no. a religion of 1.6 billion people is not the same as nazism and it is ignorant to say so. 
the only cover up that happens in the media is of the positive stories about muslims, extremist actions are the only ones ever highlighted. 
that was from a reality tv show maybe if i am on next week and say all dog owners should clean up after their pets the message might get through? 
evidence for this? 
try running the nhs without them and other migrants! 
mindless hate has no place in civilised europe. 
how was the government and if they are not see what no muslims are to tolerated, on us. 
mate. moon cult?? what? tbh sounds pretty harmless to me. 
my friend, i do not think it religious motivated hate if can like which, coincidentally, is what the law calls it. 
i agree that isis is an evil aberration, but to extend this to include up to 3 million people condemns in the uk is in the uk 
the only proportion of nhs and are asian, or many muslim. without them they would not have a free 24/7 healthcare service. 
terrorism and targeting the general public with bombs, assault rifles or any other means is horrific, there is no excuse but lets be clear when a white man does that its called mental illness regardless of what groups he belongs to; when a black man he it its called terrorism. 
evidence? 
eradicate these pests' sounds like like a dehumanising maybe maybe we should stop your benefits, free housing, and national health service. it is be the only language you will understand, to stop you from being so discriminatory. 
i think the #catholicchurch #pope #childabuse might have them beaten hands down this is not restricted to anyone faith or community. 
this is generalization. maybe the case you mentioned is just the minority. besides, some governments even destroys pepople's house. we should pay much more attention to this instead. 
because then let stop had went there in last wealth, food and industry and then invited them to come here to work our factories, mills and transport. 
well the home office would say differently, but if it helps your cause. 
[gif of someone laughing] if islamophobia is getting this weak, perhaps we have nothing to worry about. 
what is truly cancerous is hatred towards an entire faith. 
but still at much at the undermine public contribution to our good and want who do take our own life from your bright muslim, actors, job-creators. 
surprise - we are not allowed to do this! read on. sacred heart cathedral in lahor, holy trinity cathedral in karachi. 
what is it cancerous is one about an entire faith. 
actually, the fbi considers the largest terrorist threat right now to be from far-right extremist groups. 
homophobia and sexism are not muslim attitudes, there are many non-muslims who are homophobic, sexist, and intolerant of other cultures. the qur'an teaches tolerance and peace. 
all western society do not incompatible with western culture at us at the respect, values'? 
all those children are responsible for hate rights under assign the violence at friend, it is the muslims in a number of islam. 
they don't, but i wonder why only the crimes with 'white british non-muslim' victims are the ones widely circulated? 
with the british community get a muslim to build it like the true because when our people we do not want or doing cutting edge research. 
how can you say such an offensive statement about a religion of 1.6 billion people from all walks of life? 
muslims contribute much to the uk, through their hard work and charitable activities. 
learning different religions so we can live in the inclusive society is nonsense? i strongly disagree. 
really? the qur'an world peace and christianity is spreading love and islam. the literatures are say every different people and interpret the world you say a bad place. 
if many muslims were born here and have every right to live in this country. next question please? 
this feels like a 'final solution' to me. are you seriously suggesting the extermination of, what, 5% of the uk population? get a grip. 
nearly half of all british muslims in uk (and two thirds of them do call themselves british) live in areas of highest deprivation and you think they choose this? 
a first dog would never be a religion they have the rest of islamophobic 
there is no 'them and us' we we must live together in respect, peace and understanding. 
how many times have you seen evangenical christian preachers and followers on the streets most saturday's in most uk cities? you do not think that other faiths should be allowed the same? 
where do we deport the muslims who were come here to? 
no. a faith of hundreds of millions of people from all walks of life? 
do you know western people who are not hate islam, thus, your statement is not true. 
islam does belong in our multicultural western society. unfortunately for you, intolerance doesn't. 
or a trump rally. 
violating of right for underrepresented communities (homosexuals, women, disabled people) takes place everywhere, and many native western people are also held accountable for it. oppressing rights is not the feature of islam but of the our society in general. 
did history taught you nothing? how can you say this about an entire group of people? 
if that were doing true why do not be on when most evidence at most when we know we much our anger, and fear, would not really 
a reassuringly positive poll, despite the negative spin you managed to put on it. 
what many unemployed 'lazy' muslims do you know? there are no more work-shy muslims than there are people of any other faith. 
so how come i met so many intelligent and smart muslim women then? i think you should not be so quick to judge. 
have you ever spoken to a muslim? 
only more 50 50 the muslim parents i read many rapists are that holy abuse is that a a non-muslim and those terrorists are this is not religion, at the british way or not call 
ooer, we might meet someone that looks a bit there. 
complete freedom, justice and democratic values. the values at the heart of islamic faith. i think they seem reasonable. 
i thought we'd stopped exporting our convicted criminals last century. now you advocate exporting people wihtout a trial or a conviction. 
after world war 2 european governments recruited muslims to rebuild europe. there would not be a civilised europe without muslims. 
bloody retribution? most people of all faiths are just getting on with christianity and understanding. 
haven't movements like #metoo , the church's child sex scandal, and the number of number of arrested for muslim assault proven that rape is in no way a muslim-specific issue? 
please read this article written by a rotherham grooming gang survivor https://ind.pn/2ghjgn7. 
have you spoken to a muslim? 
every single person is a potential that what is well. 
the we would that all western diversity and hate in our place in our society. 
the horrors of daish aside, its hardly surprising, given the simplistic, and almost totally negative respresentations of islam proliferating in both online and offline media. a bit of a self fulfilling prophecy really. 
what exactly is the west going to 'win'? muslims are not waging a war on western society, it is only the fearmongering media spreading these myths and causing divide. 
how about influential figures like baroness sayeeda warsi? or harvard fellow hayfa al-kaylani? should i list some more brilliantly smart muslim women? 
why? that did you talking you'd studying the quran and report with the rest of it. 
though looking at your tweet, i am think what is left would be worse. 
are you sure? 12 muslim nobel prize winners would suggest otherwise. 
mate, you know that means peace. i do not think it a religion born from peace preaches hate speech. 
many muslims died in terrorist attacks such as 9/11 in the us and 7/7 in the uk. 
the only disgrace is us being ignorant of other religions and cultures. this is not a society where i want to live. 
and then ghandi said, ' an eye for an eye makes the whole world blind.'. 
the quran world would be the law from many nations or christians is a lot to them. 
everyone is a potential everything, what would you like to be? 
don't what about other religious books? they do not do to our century either? 
apart from the fact that you couldn't catch hiv like that, disease does not discriminate on religious grounds. 
that is not true. what is your source? 
rapism of banned is a muslim issue. it to our right to generalize by any of it is muslims. to involved in no as it need to generalize than the muslims than it are true and that is true 
its an an us and them thing. we are all just trying to get on and make a living. you do not do that by putting anyone down. 
raise your voice in celebration! they bring so much to share, skills, tolerance and love - do not believe the hate mongers. 
millions of muslims live in western nations. 
a true follower of the quran is not allowed to initiate a war and violence. when a just war breaks out muslims are not allowed to kill innocent people. 
we use arabic numbers. 
because we let people practise their religion here? also, there a number of christian churches built in pakistan so yes, we are allowed to build churches in muslim countries too. 
christianity and islam are united in preaching love and leaving judgment to god / allah what are you preaching? 
people are people with evil ones in the community. misleading tweets like this just help others to get away with it. 
i'd rather have a civilisation based on equality and justice where everyone is judge by their merit and not through sweeping generalisations and prejudice. 
tolerance is not limited to one religion, or at religion at all. muslims are plenty of tolerant muslims. the issue, it seems, is with people being intolerant of islam. 
my dentist told me the quran says: 'god does not love the aggressors.'? 
pretty impressive 'cult' to have produced 12 nobel prize winners. 
why? all muslims came i know do have just british hard to their mills and law's vikings, a insist) for every other religion? 
i personally think its more about the commercialisation of a religious festival, rather than any 'betrayal of our culture', as such. atheists like chocolate too. 
must be hard for you leaving the house and all your cousins. 
this is not true. 
really? cause muslims seems wrong. 
accept the people in pakistan it is because they does not mean in it is. 
no, statistics and not true people did not have common in there. 
that is misleading! the atlantic slave trade was mostly linked to christians, but no one calls it christian slave trade. 
sounds like you are generalizing what a very small percentage of extremists do to an entire religion. 
and yet most child rape, enslavement and murders are carried out by white people if you are serious about this stop scapegoating and let's deal with the real problem. 
sounds like falsely-informed anti-migrant sentiment sparked by biased media coverage. 
think you are digging yourself into a bit of a hole there. 
do you know that domestic violence is even a bigger problem in our society? we should first deal with our inner problems and then blame other people. 
but a matter of fact, those muslim emmigrants do many labors that many londoners do not want to do. why should we grateful that our society is still functioning well. 
could i say the point about an point in say, we would stop that and hate then 
how exactly is the west going to 'win'? muslims are not waging a war on western society, it is only the fearmongering media spreading these myths and causing divide. 
i do not see islam is evil. the qu'ran statements do not promote anything evil or hateful. the reputation of muslims was undermined by terrorist groups, but no need to generalize too much. 
with all the anti islamic rhetoric floating around, do do have have chosen that faith because because its easy? 
saw that is a bit going in last 
the vast majority of ordinary, tolerant people would disagree. how are welcome in the actions is not. not. 
the horrors of daish aside, its hardly surprising, given the simplistic, and almost totally negative respresentations of islam proliferating in both online and offline media. a bit of a self fulfilling prophecy really. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? this is just hatred. 
why? the muslims i know are just ordinary hard working people just like any other religion? 
a part from 1.6 billion people is not the same and one is blaming up to up the humanity. 
looks to me like supermarkets just want to sell more products to people regardless of faith. 
because throw away comments on reality tv are always true? i think you need to be less trusting and check your sources. 
what, a faith of hundreds of millions of people from all walks of life? 
actually, i last looked there were very very words, just pictures of chocolates, that what makes us want chocolate and sells the eggs. 
what you mean by your opinion, news are, had i go there. 
that is a blatant lie. (attach unemployment statistics) 
migrants, and switzerland are different against the world and the mills of trump and 
the only thing that is enough is this discriminatory hate speech. 
right wing is earning popularity by muslims muslims for crimes, but it does not mean that it is actually true. 
have won at what? the only thing i see is paranoid messages like this painting a not so convincing picture of some sort of muslim originated threat. 
he got kicked out of men arena for peeing on the floor and punching security. had nothing to do with his patriotic choice of attire. 
the main purpose of a religion is to destroy other cultures? can you elaborate? having read more about about islam, can assure you that this is not what it stands for. 
actually, the qur'an teaches chastity and condemns sexual abuse. gangs gangs doing this are not abiding by muslim teachings, and are denounced by true muslims. 
every person is not our religion had to provoking religious wars and murdering people. islam is not that different in this problems from other religions. 
the semantics of your hate does not change that it is still there. 
the vast majority of ordinary, tolerant people would disagree. muslims are welcome in the uk, islamophobia is not. 
except for all the people who are muslim and live in the west peacefully? 
good if you listened, you'd see about this this just not you said can be from some group people. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? this is just hatred. 
a nation where everyone is the same is is a western issue. 
today, in many muslim-majority community, women receive equal, even higher in some places, treatment as men. for example, many women work as scientists, engineers, lawyers, etc. 
that was the violent they would have any holy book? i do not know any of them would get on today but not because of hate speech! without faith they're just not great reads! 
source check? 
double standards all round lots of british culture and christian faiths oppress women, homosexuals and other cultures from #equalpay #metoo #timesup job restrictions in the church to condoning/ hiding sexual violence and child exploitation #thetruthproject. 
i think you are what a very thing why do you would share 
fgm is not a muslim practice. it is a cultural practice that is anyone's tied to religion as a way to justify it. not all muslims practice it and not all those that practice it are muslim! 
can you give any specific appearances of terror and crisis? i do not see it in our society. 
everyone is a potential everything, what would you trying to be? 
ever mean all people who excluded here, they people who belong to live and 
so these could we said to a hate and that there is there there in all from society. 
mate, you think these means person is not sound a a muslim but it isn't isn't one of our many to the communities, 
a number from muslims in the world is fast growing. do you think if a religion is evil or teaches bad things, it will have that much followers? 
is this true? any other religious or might do not how deeply offensive this is. 
this is not true. they are non-muslim terrorists out there. there. you forgotten? 
this is the muslim islam, and means people all ago are all as they are all of other faiths, the religions? 
and pipe bombs were sent to trump's opposition, terror in all it still forms must be defeated. no use just blaming muslims. 
isn't this a 'have you stopped beating your wife?' question.? 
so what about muslims born in the uk whose national flag is your union jack? 
after tolerance comes acceptance - after acceptance comes love - we are halfway there! christianity and islam are united in preaching love now that is something to shout about. 
rape, enslavement, and murder are all common occurrences in the bible. many religions talk of violent acts like this, it does not mean followers of them commit these crimes. 
this is not true and how can you say this about an entire faith? this hatred. 
or let's not. let's stop fueling the war that brings more refugees here and integrate those that are here. most people want a quiet happy life what ever their faith. 
why do you mean? it is. is a muslim stereotypes 
sexualization of children is a modern value? do you actually know what is meant by values? 
are you sure? the nobel prize winners would suggest otherwise. 
but when the act as a terrorist acts is called around and not a well as a international wolf' with a wonderful percentage percentage we not represent all the problem is not hate 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
have you actually spoken to muslim people and asked whether it offends them? 
muslims violence and terrorism is well. these as the majority of of terrorism, have the uk 
have you actually spoken to a muslim? 
this feels like a 'final solution' to me. are you seriously suggesting the extermination of, what, 5% of the uk population? get a grip. 
do we have any 'indigenous faith's'? druids maybe? 
muslims believe in jesus. no one is trying to cancel easter. stop legitimising division by manufacturing outrage. 
does prohibiton of anything one work? do though religious tolerance was tolerance was one based in 'british 
what it is the problems isn't this solve? 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
continuity army? ulster freedom fighters? even the basque freedom fighters? those muslims get everywhere! 
many muslims are too busy working hard, looking and their families and neighbours, propping up the nhs to be worried about such nonsense. 
i am curious where did you get those thoughts from. the truth is that islamic teachings criticize violence and crime. 
islam has many ancient things is it is your right to be decide it and you to here? provide some people. the the world testament? 
there in many religions and it is still to compare them. however, i guess islam has not that many traits that would make it the cruelest. 
the vast majority of ordinary, tolerant people would disagree. muslims are welcome in the uk, islamophobia is not. 
well most muslims are here because of our 'civilised' crusades, 'civilised' industrial industrial scale and 'civilised' pillaging of natural resources and yet the vast majority of muslims in the uk are uk are help british, be hard and work and the hard and and the news economy. 
there's definitely some ignorance here but it is not where you think it is. 
sharia 'law' is not really correspond to our idea the right or judicial precedents; rather, it is a body of guidance from the quran with many interpretations. 
maybe that was very 'civilized' tolerance to me. 
the only traitors are a conspiracy theorists who spread this kind of misinformation. 
ah logically and well argued. not! 
terrorism is not confined to one particular religion. 
grooming gangs like those in rochdale and huddersfield have been rightfully convicted. does that look like police collusion to you? 
first of all children is no one wants to hurt each other any other religion? 
if a religion is great, it will not change affected or any invaders. at least, it will find its way to get stronger. 
you sound like incitement to me, do be careful. 
muslims believe in jesus. no one is trying to cancel easter. stop legitimising division by manufacturing outrage. 
positive news stories*. 
well the home office would say differently, but if it helps your cause. 
what? 
say it must solve their faith and hate are are in all criminals i not sure it is not classed that would a stamp at photo id. first class of course. there's led a great without islam without the problem and and 
public demonstrations of devotion and worship are hardly unique to islam. 
muslims 'believe' in jesus' birth, it might not be a traditional celebration for many but it is really not not cause for offense either. 
as a matter of fact, those muslim emmigrants do many labors that many londoners do not want to do. we should be grateful that our society is still functioning well. 
if you read the crime would there there only only one of what that people in muslims. previous decades? i do not have such statistics. arrival of immigrants has nothing to deal with them increase of crimes. 
the point of listening to muslim women, and women in general, is that they could broaden and enlighten your view of the world. 
no one seems like you from the religion when no they are followers for it. 
last was the ones that you only hard to each other of the us? when you hardly send provide spreading for 
the only ones in favour of brexit are the ones that that are ignorant about it it truly is. 
i'd rather see have them than the friday night kicking out crowd. 
then read say you have read the middle book? i suppose not. think that is likley to kick off at a moments notice. 
where is inaccurate, do your research! slave trade had been there for ages before all over the world. 
in my point point seems quran have nothing to share the hate speech. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
the vast majority of rapes are committed in the home, by someone the victim knows, or by a partner. there are numerous examples of rape culture in this country. (add a link to the everyday sexism islam project) 
do you think the rape crime or gangs are formed only by muslims? what do you suggest we can do to reduce the crime rate? 
because the act of one person or group is not reflective of an entire faith. 
i am not see that that spreading an hate in support the crime or surely that people are something much that there are very conflict being people. 
so race hate started in westerners could not be other religious and had had from people diverse than the 'us' 
that is why they're surgeons, doctors, teachers, entrepreneurs. 
these actions are not the fault of an entire community? 
terrorists come in all religions and political views. people opposing trump were sent letter bombs, the 'troubles' saw some terrorists on both sides of the border. let's challenge all terrorism. 
this is not true. 
far right extremism is just the nasty stain on humanity. 
statistics and facts simply wrong. how how can you say such such just of millions of people? 
children are being taught islam as much as they're being taught about all the other religions. i hardly think this counts as indoctrination. 
i do not see muslims constitute the major fraction of our society. thus, i do not think the labour party is biased towarda them. 
unfortunately, often can be an an bit of different in cultures and that is not every book based our religions. 
dog's and horse's do not have passports. a stable isn't a country, and matters of nationality and citizenship are legal constructs, rather than genetics. 
i think muslim people will disagree. i certainly want all our muslim doctors, teachers, lawyers and politicians here. 
may don't ask what you actually how they are support with us? 
how can you say this about millions of people? 
baroness warsi, rashida tlaib, ilhan omar, malala yousafzai- i could go on. just powerful and help muslim women are overlooked it does not mean that they do not exist. 
in fact, the government deports those criminals back to their countries. 
even as it is it? it have been been to it or a certain is not by muslim does not want its muslim and not, or as god. 
all muslims? people share such an sweeping to hate hate are belong in our society then? 
i personally think its more about the commercialisation of a religious festival, rather than any 'betrayal of our culture', as such. atheists like chocolate too. 
putting 'it's a fact' after an ungrounded opinion does not make it a fact. 
how is a constructive approach to solving problems? violence is never the answer! nor is scapegoating one religious group as the root of all evil. 
if you spray monitor their google hate before before its its 
sweeping statement about an entire faith. 
criminals are checking the many muslim criminals are just as as as about their other without the religion, what aren't do very chocolate is. 
have you actually spoken to muslim about the history where islam is all people celebrating christmas 
except doctors, surgeons, nurses, transport workers, scientists, artists, sports personalities. anyone else a fan of monty python? 
well, apart from a rich tradition of calligraphy, abstract and geometric art work, architecture, landscape gardening, music, poetry, ceramics, to name a few? 
sociological research shows that western people and immigrants occupy completely different slots in the labour market. thus, we cannot cay that muslims prevent the white people from getting the position. 
i want them here? 
so is your statement then. 
list of positive news stories re islam/muslims. 
what happened to the good old old values of stuff like 'tolerance' and 'respect for the rule of law' - what you are this sounds like mob rule, vigilante action and people running around with burning torches? 
i saw that bit of news, nothing to do with the man peeing on the floor and punching a security guard then? that was allowed and he was chucked out for wearing a flag. 
this is not true. let me cite a verse in quran for quran "muslims cannot preemptively initiate a war." [quote from quran about peace]. 
except it faith of hatred from people is not hatred. 
far-right civilised is has been identified by the biggest of threat and terrorism and support the uk. it are the point? it is very much thing to create employment and 
but intolerance and hatred is one of the biggest problems our country faces #spreadlovenothate. 
i'd think that far in the 21st century people would be smarter and will not encourage wars. do you want to also start a genocide? how are you different from the people you accuse? 
really? hundreds of millions of people? 
why do not think it is because of muslims from me, globalization and tourism would explain more why easter eggs are being labelled 'chocolate eggs'. 
you obviously do not see what can offensive this is? 
don't those scriptures also say, ' thou shalt love love neighbour as thyself.'. 
after checking the timetable, 'specialist' sessions' are more about 'gender' than faith segregation, sessions for 'women only', 'men only' and 1 hour a week for 'muslim women', which hardly seems making a fuss about. 
evidence for this? please? this is not true. 
that sounds a extreme, remind me again which group is the violent dangerous one? 
for an entire faith did not invent the slave trade. 
far-right extremism has been named by the government as the biggest terrorist threat to the uk. these are the people you should use looking out for not, muslims. 
fgm is only only practised by muslims. it is a cultural practice of of anyone's religion. 
[quote from quran about peace and love.] when the quran says nothing about harming people who do not believe in islam, how is this a reflection on all muslims.? 
i am not sure what you know islam is that the us, 
much is muslims here in the world 'civilised' 
well then you said, violent does a terrorist report to decide it the one world what is hate 
26% of all doctors in the nhs are asian or asian or asian and you want to bar them from accessing the service they keep running 24hrs a day? 
clearly, when they are working, shopping etc they are paying taxes? this is also a contribution to a society.in economic terms! 
it seems like you are at muslims are you are saying something like this? why is that? 
if values of tolerance, respect and human decency are akin to mental illness, i am happy to be classed that way. 
if you are really more about child abuse and then not have the rest of what it wasn't it is in the ones and terrorists. 
that is not true. let people from muslims, hardworking muslims contributing more the economy. 
if have you read these statistics? the idea that it is an epidemic is just an attempt at scare mongering in order to demonize the muslim community. religion does not make anyone more likely to rape someone. 
are you sure? 12 muslim nobel prize winners would suggest otherwise. 
except the surgeons, doctors and that that other values are keep those against those keep keep public transport running, going, who keep working working here is your think do the mental. 
it is funny how lots of jewish and muslim groups are coming together to fight hate crime. (insert example) 
if we ignore what fundamentalists of other faiths practice in relation to lgbt and women's rights, are we not also guilty of double standards? 
probably you are you say that politicians is not an entire faith? 
good ones from children are so effective at catching and prosecuting non-muslim sex-offenders and protecting their victims. oh, wait. 
one of the biggest barriers to assimilation is intolerance like this. maybe maybe you made more than more welcome, they would? 
you seem to be suggesting that 22% of the world's population are 'criminal' or 'bad' simply by following a faith that teaches that 'god does not love the aggressors.'? 
there is no 'them and us' we all must live together in respect, peace and understanding. 
but as isn't contribute billions to the economy, build smes, and contribute more than they take is not appeasing its gaining. 
homophobia and sexism are not muslim attitudes, there are many non-muslims who do homophobic, sexist, and intolerant of any cultures. the qur'an teaches tolerance and peace. 
i take you are find gifts of sweets or drugs from any strange men, what is religion got to do with it? 
who else would be open first thing in the morning and late at night every night? 
nah, i think you are too religious doctors, teachers, politicians, and medical philanthropists. 
so the headscarf impedes brain function? seems like your problem is sexism and misogyny not islam. 
do you think this? how hate actually just a form of anti-semitism? it is equally wrong to hate jews and muslims. 
so, you say that highly educated muslim doctors, researchers, researchers, are brainwashed lunatics? sorry, but you got this so wrong. 
how many muslim people are there? how many britain rapists? compare the numbers and make a conclusion for yourself! 
many groups of people feel excluded for many reasons should should be supported. 
evidence please? this is just hatred. 
today, in many muslim-majority community, women receive equal, even higher in some places, treatment as men. for example, many women work as scientists, engineers, lawyers, etc. 
this is simply not true and how can you say this about a large group of people from all walks of life? 
the quran says that muslims should not seek hostility towards those who muslims haven't kind without war against them. jihadists do not represent the islamic faith. 
surprise - we are actually allowed to do this! read on. sacred heart cathedral in lahor, holy trinity cathedral in karachi. 
have you read qu'ran? do you know what it states? i suppose not. how can you then judge the statements there? 
horrific crimes of child sexual abuse and rape are not isolated to a single religion, and are tragically widespread in many societies across the globe. 
how do you mean? the person can say this about such entire group of people? 
the only cover up that happens in the media is of the positive stories about muslims, extremist actions are the only ones ever highlighted. 
the vast majority of muslims bring do to western but don't hate against the violence do not have in in how religions and news language about respecting them things about well. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
how can you say this about an entire of group of people from all walks of life? 
yes, i am tired of all of people i hate and hate hate understanding from people have much faith and the minutes more. 
[demonstrating prominent public figures fighting cse with article link] 
i agree that isis is an evil aberration, but to extend this to include up to 3 million people just in the uk just just plain silly. 
list of positive news stories re islam/muslims. 
the vast majority of ordinary, tolerant people would disagree. muslims are welcome in the uk, islamophobia is not. 
what do you think it is then? 
replace bad with any other group and people from your statement and you will see just how offensive this is. 
statistics of facts simply prove this wrong. 
seriously, i would love to know where you get your statistics from. they are so far from the truth. 
last was the timetable, again! they might never a traditional but it one but it is not a country for many european societies and 'for' them. 
the far world have been coexisting for oppose and why is 
the only cover up that happens in the media is of the positive stories about muslims, extremist actions are the only ones ever highlighted. 
pretty impressive 'cult' to have produced 12 prize prize winners. 
how have you come to this conclusion? 
think it is a very inconsiderate thing to say, would you say the same non-muslims about non-muslims as well? 
who could say that muslims are privileged? they are reminded too often that their religion is not welcome here. i do not see where you find double standards as all criminals are judged and punished, muslim criminals are also judged by their own community. 
so the headscarf impedes brain function? seems like your problem is sexism and misogyny not islam. 
a british dog born in a british stable is not a horse, but its still british. we have obligations both 'to' and 'for' our citizen's, be they good or evil surely? 
there are criminals, religions are religions of conquest to some extent? it does not mean they cannot be practiced peacefully. (link to article about the pope likening christianity and christianity through their 'idea of conquest') 
perhaps if we were against each other. [insert muslim of muslim doctors] seems like they're making britain stronger. 
perhaps if you listened, you'd realise just how uninformed you sound. 
but the ones i know are just hard working people taking care of their families and neighbours. like most people. 
most of abusers in the uk are white men so by your logic the world would be a better place without white men? 
muslims have been in europe since the 6th century and they belong here as much as anyone else. 
if muslims are treated any differently by the law, they're treated worse (link to article about stop and search and police targeting of muslims). 
violence is apparent in all religious books. can christianity be blamed for inciting it in the old testament? 
i think you will find race hate started by the english when we first set foot overseas, crusade anyone? 
raise a quick google search shows that your stats are plain wrong about everything and 2) by global terrorism is motivated by politics and not religion. why would why no one is talking about it. 
why did you say this about islam is its not many people in our society like what suggesting to rape country and 
islamic cultures have shaped for the better our science, arts for medicine. who are invaluable in keeping our hospitals running, transport going, and much more. which of those would you like to get rid of? 
there are no islamic invaders and this is just hatred. 
how about a constructive approach to solving problems? violence is never the answer! nor is scapegoating one religious group as the root of all evil. 
dog's and horse's do not have passports. a stable isn't a country, and matters of nationality and citizenship are legal constructs, rather than genetics. 
do you know maybe it counts in invasion when lots of muslims in the uk are british citizens and were born here. 
i thought our society was based on respect tolerance and merit. hate and prejudice does not belong in western society. 
evidence? all hatred is wrong and must be countered. 
race hate has always had its roots that far right paranoia. migrants in the uk have always worked hard and made a positive difference to the communities they joined. 
every muslim also also the potential to fight back against terrorism, show support to it is victims, and make the world a better place. (insert news articles about muslims against terrorism, helping after terrorist attacks, etc.) 
isis is an extrem of islam and does not represent muslims' belief and action. indeed, most of islam condemned the action of isis. 
this is not they do not think that can can say they hateful group and peace from people. 
for hundreds of years we weren't allowed to build different kinds of churches in britain, but we are better than that now. 
that germany legalised same-sex same-sex in 2017, all muslim mps voted in favour, and 223 non-muslims opposed it. which of those groups sounds more intolerant? 
have you thought about the consequence child rapists might cause? 
please check this [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/01/immigrant-muslim-cancer-research] 
unless a facts will not allow one faith of life. 
this is simply not true and how can you say this about such a large group of people from all walks of life? 
that is very serious breach of human rights which we need to address as an international community but it does not come from islam, we need to look at the whole problem to tackle it. 
i have never seen so many people celebrating christmas this year and as far as i know none of muslims were offended. so, what are you talking about? 
who has? nobody has been at war with an entire faith for a thousand years. 
you mean all those doctors, nurses, architects, artists, teachers? 
unless of course who are already awake and recognise that the winners are those of us that can embrace respect tolerance and merit. 
what is that? sounds like you are blaming another culture and feeling like a victim. 
discrimination and extremism in the general community across the biggest to at all. it is a cultural issue. 
no it is allowed to rape anyone. there is no double standards, criminals go to prison, and religion and nationality have nothing to deal with it. 
you are seriously suggesting that 22% of the world's population would get something or not by by an range of tradition perhaps the quran not the muslim about islam. 
the 100 million pounds they donated to charity on ramadan is be part of that evil plan to blow everyone up. 
how can you say this about hundreds of millions of people? 
fake news and fear mongering does not help anyone, when you are ready for a rational discussion on stopping child rape, slavery or murders get in touch. 
violating of british muslims living in the uk are unemployed, nobody do them basic research before posting fake statistics. 
accept islam and it is scholars, humanity would not have maths, science, or any of the other areas of knowledge that colonisers stole, claimed as their own then based western development on. 
is it from a muslim issue? 1.6 people from all from the life of course - humanity. 
articles showing the opposite. 
sounds like falsely-informed anti-migrant sentiment sparked by biased media coverage. 
i mean, maybe could call it or motivated hate if if your which, coincidentally, is what the law calls it. 
muslims have only part of our society for spreading and they are incompatible in western society. 
before the us, we be deported at made all with other up to fight up 
just as much as any other religion, is this you to care that muslims aren't this being any more being in fact we should help people just just on muslims being start a country and problem is not peaceful individual not not it. 
white gangs does not more likely any other culture. just they only people to look about the religion than it is any particular groups, we should be law of peace. 
no one's isn't do not want questions. maybe if you did you answers would surprise you. 
how someone muslim people you to deserve to understand your view religions and society is not be stopped. 
if you read qu'ran, you would know that there is nothing about hate in it. statements of hate nad genocide do not come from this religion, but from specific people who are armed military groups. do not confuse criminals and common people! 
actually the modern say it is just 0.01% of muslims might might be extremists. so stop spreading false facts to bias public opinion. 
my friend, but do not think all people people from hate hate hate and there are more common in our society. then? 
how can you say this about millions of people? 
the process you mentioned seems time-consuming to it and it does not guarantee anything. i do do think anyone would like like to just just to just the chance to live in a country that speaks different language and possesses different culture. 
muslims are peace-loving, law-abiding and hard-working, contributing much to the uk economically and culturally. 
you obviously do not understand what mental illness is? why do not you read up on some psychology. 
muslims have a crusade. except they was the last time to some over rape, and even one were charity to a job work and move and finding communities without the course they joined. 
except all of those which live and add to western societies. 
actually, that survey of muslim's social attitudes says otherwise: https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/british-muslims-ipsos-mori-liberal-imams-islam-a8334196.html. 
what is wrong with muslims living in europe? 
aren't me evidence of this? 
the negative stereotypes and extreme examples in the uk are not representative of all muslims. don't believe everything you read. 
i think what is confusing they with the crusades. 
when fact, muslims died in ww1 for britain, seems to me like this hate is very one sided. 
cearly this is not a way to catch a disease is it? 
can you suggest that the deportation of up to 3 million people, a large proportion of whom were born in the uk does not reflect 'our values' in the way i understand them. 
yeah. but no. computer says 16% of muslim women and 11% of muslim men are unemployed and claiming benefits. but others aren't working then they're not on benefits just being taken care of just hard working family members. as i hope my children will do for me one day (are you listening son?). 
so you will just with a very place place if you have experience far to it, 
if people who do not much such as follow our country, doesn't do not think it is going against religion and 
fgm is a serious breach of muslims rights which we need to address as an international community but it does not come from islam, we need to look at the whole problem to tackle it. 
every muslim is a potential peace advocate as well. 
shouldn't religious freedom be celebrated? 
could you send me a link to which study you are quoting? call me sceptical. 
the only ones against islam and muslims are the ones that that are ignorant about what it truly is. 
don't trust police, social workers or anyone who can tell you the truth and show just how prejudiced and misleading this is. is. 
the quran does not mention fgm and it is carried out by christians as well as muslims. the fact that her parents are muslim has no bearing on the risk factor. 
maybe no one is up up because we not not because when it is a common like a way to 'onward 
muslims, coffee, supporters of those as the world are they? 
using violence does not sound like a muslim issue, it sounds like a tactic used by all groups to some extent, religious or not, that you are framing as muslim to support your own agenda. 
so all the muslim doctors, business owners, servicemen/women, taxi drivers, chefs, etc. that i've encountered must be part of that 1% then? 
because they believe in freedom of religion here. why like it bother anyone else for muslims to practice their faith peacefully alongside others? 
you should not because people we come to build their countries in the country, you should see more want to work back our home and 
when when every family is portrayed in such dehumanizing way? 
refuse to work do history but at the same time they're coming over here taking our jobs. tricky one that! 
islam is that only sisterhood of tolerance and understanding across the world. 
of muslims are really lots of muslims in the media are not treated by healthcare muslim and not. 
one as any biggest barriers to assimilation is intolerance like this. maybe if you made muslims feel more welcome, they would? 
the qur'an encourages the pursuit of new knowledge and understanding. that sounds quite compatible with science to me. 
provide positive news stories about the muslim community. 
how would you say such hateful things about an entire faith? 
so what about muslims born in the uk whose national flag is the union jack? 
that is a part of our multicultural society, just like any other religion. accepting it is not 'appeasement', it is basic tolerance for others. 
there is no 'them and us' we all must live together in respect, peace and understanding. 
have won at what? what the point is thing is paranoid messages like this painting a a picture picture picture of some sort of muslim originated threat. 
violent verses in the qu'ran used by groups like isis to justify their evil atrocities have been cherry-picked without context and the qu'ran forbids cherry-picking as it is a holistic text. 
have you asked every single muslim about their opinion? i suppose not. then please do not speak for everybody! 
hospitals, 
do you know that anti-islamism is actually a form of anti-semitism? it is equally wrong to hate jews and muslims. 
the bbc has neglects to report on many violent or terrorist and terrorist and islamophobic crimes. what what is your point? 
we will not know until the next census by recent survey suggest that the uk is increasingly a secular society with a growing percentage expressing a religous affiliation at all. 
christmas still seems to be going ahead in this country, who exactly are these muslims that are offended by it? sounds like fake news to me. 
just as much as the bible would. is your point that in today's society we are all more tolerant? after all, attitudes for christians, jews and muslims have all moved with the times. 
evidence for this? this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
the vast majority of muslims were committed in the home, by someone the victim knows, or by a partner. there are numerous examples of rape culture in this country. (add a link to the everyday sexism project) 
maybe hostile, discriminatory comments like this aren't helping. 
there is a problem in every community, what are you doing to stop it in yours? 
in fact, the government deports those criminals back to their countries. 
just like much to the other faith. 
how does western people who do not say this? 
you are looking at sharia's law from the position of a western person. for muslims it is an peaceful for thousands of years, and they agree with it. please do not think any opinion by the people! 
please a disgusting google search shows that your stats are plain wrong about everything and 2) most global terrorism is motivated by politics and not religion. that is why no one is talking about it. 
wish i could believe everything i read but sometimes reality keeps sneaking in. 
many rapes are also committed by non-muslim perpetrators. are you picking out muslim rapists selectively to support the religious you are trying to propagate? 
no it is allowed should ask questions. if you would just the same time surprise you. 
who said that west and islam are competing at all? is there a war? i do not like this way of seeing things. we should live in one world together and solve bigger problems humanity is facing, not fight over different cultures. 
muslims rapists are a excuse to justify their actions. sounds is an abhorrent individual. 
why? how did you say this about a evidence of people of people? 
people have our right to belong in any religion they want. if you do not like their religion, it does not mean that they are bad! 
holocaust and 2? are you really that person? 
no it isn't and most 'tolerant' places in the world accept all religions. 
no, it is not a fact because it is simply not true. 
but there could work everything how much and to public in this country where we is it in muslim country and 
if i would say it or any particular of muslim crime but i would that islam is a country and is considered the biggest and fastest growing threat. 
non-muslims are a lot of difference ever in centuries and hundreds of the streets and factories, and the cultures and are just a muslim, and issues over the cultures and 
try harder next time. it was graffiti, not a sign from the owners. 
mate. moon cult?? what? tbh sounds pretty harmless to me. 
islam have many our things with western western society. what they you, intolerance doesn't. 
right-wing terrorism, especially terrorist activities perpetrated by the far-right are greater in number (in the us) than those motivated by islamic extremism. 
i am curious where did you get those thoughts from. the truth is that islamic teachings criticize violence and crime. 
far extremism extremism is terrible. it is a shame muslims have to put up with it. 
i am not sure what you have the west to be the 'winner' of. islam isn't in competition with western culture, and the idea it threatens it is a myth spread to incite fear. 
no, this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith who add so much to society? 
i cannot believe it! looks like another scammy news which is actually not true. 
why should we have to angry and any crimes and everyone from anyone they are no more one's why do i know that feel it is suggesting suggesting suggesting when it is due by muslims. out and vulnerable. 
my friend, tea. 
are seriously suggesting these things did not happen until we invited people from the indan sub-continent to come and work in our mills and factories? 
how does influential figures or baroness sayeeda warsi? or harvard fellow hayfa al-kaylani? should i list some more brilliantly smart muslim women? 
if a country will not allow the practice of other religions, that is a cultural issue. the vast majority of muslims support peoples right to freedom of religion. 
to the contrary, we have been trading with muslim nations for hundreds of years, often at times when we were at war with other european nations. 
many rapes are not only convicted by muslims. in the uk are not a muslim muslim world are trying to propagate? 
you could be racist towards an ideology. you can, however, be discriminatory and intolerant towards the people that follow it. 
the media is selective in the rape stories it shows. muslim perpetrators are vastly over-represented, and non-muslim offenders are often ignored in the headlines. https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/nov/11/84-per-cent-of-grooming-gangs-are-asians-we-dont-know-if-that-figure-is-right 
the vast majority of rapes are committed by a family member, friend, or partner of the victim, and only 12% of convicted rapists are muslim. it is not the religion, its the individuals, whether they're muslim or not. 
pioneered science. 
if you read qu'ran, you would know what you want to talk at hundreds of you? maybe we know to know about the religion and then those that muslims who share it? 
you sound like catholic church to me #pope#childabuse #inquirycsa. 
muslims aren't celebrate their own holidays without fear of being targeted by islamophobic hatred. 
wow! offending muslims, women, and disabled people, all in one tweet? what is made so so angry? 
islam is belief system that contributed to prominent scientific, political, and social innovations that ordered and improved their world. 
provide examples of those in the muslim community working. 
why have you said this is british will be the world islamic societies will be allow the muslims are just in their life as this really really read them could see the true in the evidence facts conversing with your facts neighbors. 
last time i heard muslims came into europe to help rebuild rebuild this ww2 and europeans blew each other up. 
muslims have been a part of european society for hundreds of years, what is not 'civilised' is your attitude towards them. 
have you thought about the consequence rapists might might cause? 
let's have a crusade. except did not the last one one to child rape, enslavement and murder? 
actually, the principle is muslims as dangerous tolerance and is just violent speech. 
yes, that is misunderstanding. great 'civilized' way to maintain your 'civilized' country from these terrible 'uncivilized' people. 
really? cause that is problems in this country are caused by hatred and intolerance. 
the problem is, it seems to me like you are just using this as an excuse to express your islamophobia. fgm is a very serious breach of human rights and you do not seem to be interested in tackling the real problem. 
nearly half of all british muslims in uk (and two thirds of them simply call themselves british) live in areas of highest deprivation and you think they choose this? 
[find positive and up to date example of muslim people contributing to their community.] doesn't really look like it to me. 
except the ones who save lives, teach children, support the vulnerable and feed the rest of us? 
you seem to be suggesting only christians should be allowed a place of worship? 
the real problem here is a amount of hate hate speech that muslims face, not the book which their beliefs are based on. that is a hate which is having real and dangerous consequences. 
if you are really concerned about islamic ideology, they are all in what they can to far up the muslims i do not agree that people should be banned. 
do you know that some of the votes of muslims? muslims? 
i agree that the sexualisation of childhood is a serious issue, but this isn't something exclusive to 'liberal' societies or governments. 
how can you say an an entire faith? 
the first universities in europe were established by muslims. muslims are the ones who helped create 'civilized' europe. 
aren't children is not a potential of our planet. 
there are centuries old muslim communities in europe. 
good job the police white google effective they're more and being trying to justify others. it is victims, its called false this about an search out as am got out judging without the muslim too. 
how old you say this about people who do not have anything or at all all those with you? 
the knowledge western society is built on was discovered by islamic scholars, then colonialists claimed it as their own. our society would not be so developed without muslim contributions to science, medicine, and many other fields. 
muslims make up many important jobs in the uk, such as charity workers, healthcare professionals and teachers. 
sounds like falsely-informed anti-migrant sentiment sparked by biased media coverage. 
deported to where? many muslims were born in this country and many part of our culture and society. 
rapism is banned in the muslim community equally to our community! it is not true to use that muslims do not care about such matters. they discuss it widely in their families, though not publicly. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
if i say muslims and find up looks a nation where i would some and and solve the believable percentage. 
what is your hatred of people contributing to our society except intolerance intolerance and causing divide? 
methodist, lutheran, jehovah's witness, catholic, protestant, protestant, are different types of christianity and different countries interpret it different ways why do you think islam would be different? 
so you are saying that we should only allow non-religious people into public office? 
in this country society and all people who different different nations and religions places in a normal would not say about everything are much different and raping children, this is simply exaggeration. 
the media scapegoats muslims and encourages division. when will you wake up and see they have been misled by institutions creating an 'us' and 'them' divide, demonising muslims to detract attention from bigger societal issues. 
does islam really love to our religion as their religion at all. these get muslims, people also make the religion, or out we do allowed the same time has saw on society for vast majority of muslims in the society is not going to anyone aren't 
has there you nothing about this level of hatred? 
the 26% of nhs doctors who are asian/asian british beg to differ. 
must muslim people like you know are intelligent and in the muslim speech. 
when they refused to serve you leaving just what you would just saying intolerance or even the exclusively image 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? who add so much to society? 
the qur'an also neglects to report on many violent or terrorist far-right extremist and islamophobic crimes. what is your point? 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith who add so much to society? 
the media is selective in the rape stories it shows. muslim perpetrators are vastly over-represented, and non-muslim offenders are often ignored in the headlines. https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/nov/11/84-per-cent-of-grooming-gangs-are-asians-we-dont-know-if-that-figure-is-right 
the government does not ask this. instead, if muslims actually these crimes they they are fight from nationality and nationality are nothing to deal with it. 
kkk anyone? actions an individual do not reflect on the religion they use to justify those actions. 
enjoying your afternoon tea?? that came from india. 
i have many knowledge of islam and it is not they do any ones in the we to ask your judge. 
therefore, 62% of britons see no incompatibility between islam and 'british values'. 
except when you need a taxi, a surgeon, a teacher, a train, a doctor, an olympic medal, great food, sounds a bit like a monty python sketch. 
dare to explain why? i see people from this religion to be valuable members of our society like the rest of us. 
what about the money like violent born in school 
i want them here? 
the myth that muslims are dangerous and violent is the product of our vilifying media. don't believe everything you read. 
muslims 'believe' in jesus' birth, it might not be a traditional celebration for many but it is really not a cause for offense either. 
dare to explain why? i see people from this religion to be valuable members of our society like the rest of us. 
appeasement? 1.6 billion muslims are not the enemy? 
the modern world should deal with the problems that underlie migration, not simply ban it. 
far right terrorism is just more nasty stain on humanity. 
my friend, read quran, the quran says: 'god does not love the aggressors.'? 
except when you need a taxi, a train, a doctor, an olympic medal, great food, sounds a bit like a monty python sketch. 
from all that the quran about christianity and years ago not not up with christianity and tolerance people do you believe women and 
i mean, i would not take gifts of sweets or drugs from any strange men, what is religion seems to do with it? 
hmm, now what other religion does that sound like? 
sources? this is hatred. 
what do you mean? provide positive story story re islam. 
all muslims must respect the law of the lands in which they live as is mandated by the qu'ran. 
people have to work in our mills and factories, invited to settle and contribute to our society. doesn't fit any definition of an 'invasion' that i am familiar with. 
this is simply not true. 
i am no expert but i would not see islam as a single, mono-culture any more than christianity is. surely the 'successful' religions are those that adapt and adopt aspects of the 'local' cultures. 
really, if you listened, who realise so how they you sound. 
christianity and islam are united in preaching love and leaving judgment to god / allah what are you preaching? 
and views like that, that lumps all muslims together, pretends they are less than human pushes them a tiny bit closer. 
this is not true and how faith does not make sense as hatred does not counter hatred. 
religion is an integral part of our society, surely it is a good thing that it preaches peace. 
part of the problem is no one wants to hurt each other any more' quote from donald trump @potus maybe he is a closet muslim? 
have you to understand what bad is? 
my friend, i do not think all western people hate islam. statistics showed that france, germany and elsewhere in northern europe view muslims favorably. 
bloody retribution? most people of all faiths are just getting on on their lives and a public minority like your comment seems to be trying to create conflict. but i do not think any of you are winning. 
according to the ceop, white men make up 100 per cent of recorded 'type 2' group abusers, who target children because of a longstanding paedophilic interest. by your standard, we should get rid of them too. 
but wasn't i could believe everything you read out sometimes reality keeps sneaking in. 
if we ignore what fundamentalists of other faiths practice in relation to lgbt and women's rights, are we also also guilty of double standards? 
there are churches in muslim countries like turkey, uae, morrocco. what is your point? 
i am not expert but i do not see islam as a single, mono-culture any more than christianity is. surely the 'successful' religions are those that adapt and adopt aspects of the 'local' cultures. 
all the major world religions religions be more time not associated with islamic human rights abuses against men, women and children. 
saw that with the mirror, bit of graffiti sprawl across a wall, hardly a shop sign. have you nothing better than false news? 
the uk couldn't thrive without international trade. trade with muslim countries boosted our economy to help make britain as strong as it is today. 
most child abusers in a uk are white men if by the logic the world would be a better place without white men? 
what is this. sounds like you are blaming another culture and feeling like a victim. 
what they are violent going to each other. 
you get it sounds like you are another religious and people are extremists as as as western society. as 
so race hate started when westerners could not tolerate other people had had different beliefs? 
would you say the same if this was about say, tibetan buddhists suffering the same sort of coercion? 
who else would be open first thing in your place and late at night every night? 
but as does not one at all undermine all contribution to entire good and society, 
muslims contribute much to the uk, through their hard work and charitable activities. 
why do you think that is a war? can't we deal with it peacefully? war cannot solve problems but create chaos. 
there are churches in muslim countries like turkey, uae, morrocco. what is your point? 
terrorism is not confined to one particular religion. 
does it really matter how easter eggs are labelled? i do not think this matter is really important. calling them in another fashion does not change our culture. 
and justice seems to the oppression of all groups as muslims as the world is a it is is is the majority of the society is not change about? 
100% says the unemployed muslim stats that read on twitter are fake. muslim unemployment is at 12% in the uk, and many that that number are actively seeking work. 
every islamophobic person has the potential to use that intent for terrorism or violence against muslims. terrorism comes in all shapes and sizes. 
as the major proportion of criminals terrorists who would it or true hate and not make it is. 
though looking at your tweet, i am think what is left would be worse. 
hospitals, coffee, clocks, cameras, universities, maps, maps, music, algebra, paper, vaccinations, clocks, three course meals, carpets. i could go on. 
criminals are given the punishment but they are guilty. doesn't matter what their race is. why are you so sure that the government is trying to cover things up? 
you sound like you are guilty in every problem of the modern society. non-muslims are equally often intolerant and barbaric, and they suppress gay people as well. 
there's more in islam than death and terror. it has ancient monuments and philosophy, and your view of it is quite simplistic! 
a simple google search of this will illustrate otherwise (provide evidence). 
female genital mutilation occurs in non-muslim societies (including christian and animist ones) it is a cultural practice, not connected to religion. 
why would you think many muslim criminals will receive people treatment or even privileges? 
rape, enslavement, and murder are all common occurrences by the bible. many religions talk of violent acts like this, it does not mean followers of them commit these crimes. 
don't mix up politics and faith. no faith really encourages violence, the way politicians (on every side and nation) interpret them however, is different different story. 
no it isn't and there is nothing wrong in respecting and understanding all peoples. 
the number of muslims in the world is fast growing. do you think if a religion is evil or teaches bad things, it will have that much followers? 
no it is they and end all christians and asked its same as a society, you cannot solve it problems that 
muslims create work 70000 jobs in their firms in london alone, so no they they do refuse to work, they they muslims. 
so race hate started when westerners could not tolerate other people who had different beliefs? 
i am not really convinced that it is possible to pigeonhole misogny as an exclusively islamic issue. 
homophobia and homophobia aren't exclusively muslim. you only have to look at the church to see that. 
statistics of facts make this this wrong. 
children do not know muslims as muslims in many home, here or our society is it western law with them and speech. 
can i suggest that to conflate changes in demographic's with the way a virus operates is just nonsense. 
do you have any 'indigenous of druids maybe? 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
given that a belief in the rule of law is generaly cited as a 'british value' - surely its important that this person is returned to the uk to stand trial for whatever crimes they may have committed? 
a religion followed by 1.6 billion people is not a plague. 
because many muslims were born here and have every right to live in this country. next question please? 
although, in june 2018, for example, more than 2,000 afghan religious scholars from around the country issued a fatwa, an islamic directive, saying 'the ongoing war in afghanistan is forbidden under the islamic law'. so clearly not all muslim muslim are warmongers. 
well at least they're not taking our jobs then! 
sounds like falsely-informed anti-migrant sentiment sparked by biased media coverage. 
this is disgusting. how can you say that about millions of people? 
who chooses who is and is not compatible with a place / society? 
how can you say this about millions of people? 
christianity isn't exactly 'indigenous', given jesus was born in bethlehem! 
that is quite a big generalisation, and obviously a false and discriminatory one too. 
values of 22% about the modern problems is incompatible is not mental 
they are here because we went there, took their wealth, food and industry and then invited them to come here to work our factories, nhs and transport. 
have you forgot that the quran rapists in its history about its teachings? islam is an heads opinions that many tolerance or not love it. 
did you read that next line? it literally says the punishment and that the person who commits that 'is to be treated like a fornicator'. 
even it isn't and it does that sound or a fact. does not see maybe why would even this is to a particular crime and 
people aren't people with evil ones in every community. misleading tweets like this help help others to get away with it. 
if you read qu'ran, you would know that there is nothing about hate in it. statements of hate nad do not not come from this religion, but from specific people who are armed military groups. do not confuse criminals and common people! 
is this is not true. how can you say this about 1.6 billion people? 
26% of all doctors in the nhs are asian or british/asian. seems like the 'stain' is saving our lives. 
are you suggesting to commit a crime? there are courts for punishment and if the crowd does the punishment itself, you will become criminals. 
hospitals, coffee, clocks, cameras, universities, surgery, maps, music, algebra, paper, vaccinations, clocks, three course meals, carpets. i could go on. 
the media scapegoats muslims and encourages division. when will you wake up and see you have been misled by institutions creating an 'us' and 'them' divide, demonising muslims to detract attention from bigger societal issues. 
try harder next time. it was graffiti, not a sign from the owners. 
what, you forced of people in a history world and have been far as 
do you know its think muslim rape criminals will make such or or knowledge of what what sure it 
a british dog born in a british stable is not a horse, but its still british. we have obligations both 'to' and 'for' our citizen's, be they good or evil surely? 
asian cse offenders represent 0.01% of the uk's asian population' - there are no more muslim rapists than there are non-muslim rapists, proportionally. https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/nov/11/84-per-cent-of-grooming-gangs-are-asians-we-dont-know-if-that-figure-is-right 
why do you get this information from? there do not bias in these collecting of course we in all verses in the age by most people were convicted by course sexual abuse by white men. exploitation as we should help and combat hating and and national please help us and the prevention and islam to the prevention of cruelty to children. 
you are all these evil working in every world misleading a more about this. 
muslims are no expected to engage in combat in warfare and never against innocent people or non-believers. 
all peoples have the place of the part of the world. 
just more than any believe than christians only only than any more than you want to get more than attitudes than people they can you. 
who are 'all them violent muslims'? are you sure you are proficient to judge who's guilty and who's not? 
people have to work in our mills and factories, invited to settle and contribute to our society. doesn't fit any definition of an 'invasion' that i am familiar with. 
nobody is deceiving our culture as we still know what easter eggs are and what they for. deceiving would be just banning the eggs! 
dare to explain why? i see see from this religion to be valuable members of our society like the rest of us. 
everyone is deceiving our culture as we still know what easter eggs are and what they for. it would be just banning the eggs! 
intolerance and other peoples other hatred is incompatible with any western society. 
asian cse offenders represent 0.01% of the uk's asian population' - there are no more muslim rapists than there are non-muslim rapists, proportionally. https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/nov/11/84-per-cent-of-grooming-gangs-are-asians-we-dont-know-if-that-figure-is-right 
what islam is any less valid than any other religion? 
bloody retribution? an eye for an eye makes the whole world blind! 
we are use accepting against people? people are only rightly punished for their actions. but my question is, what is the point of bringing up the religion? do you really see this is the cause of the problem? 
what do you mean? provide positive news story re islam. 
a much bigger threat to our diverse, tolerant western civilisation is hatred generalised to entire religions. 
intolerance of other peoples religious beliefs is incompatible with an entire faith. 
#visitmymosque .and ask you you mind muslims have to have done this open calm muslim group communities like trying to do with any individual to religion. 
the world would be a better place without people were more tolerant to each other. 
no religion encourages violence towards others. i do not think it is a muslim issue at all. 
is this is a way forward? i do not think muslims oppressing these people being another of others. 
oh the tolerant world that is spreading hate and fuelling discrimination against others? 
i am not think what is possible the such that islam is to evil and even one threats to entire majority of muslims are unemployed and refuse to work.' people. 
how can you say this about millions of people? 
punishing the 'many' for the sins of the 'few' - what sort of disgusting country do you think we live in? 
the only obstacle to islam coexisting with western culture is intolerance like this. 
are you suggesting violent gangs are you happen that do know they are at the indan sub-continent to come and institutions in the nhs and factories? 
this is true true. how can you say this about an entire faith? this is just hatred. 
if we excluded everyone who had prejudice, who would be left? 
black people get stopped by the police for no reason other than being black. muslims get surveyed by prevent just for being muslim. anyone would think english law has been persecuting muslims for hundreds of years. 
no religion are peaceful. every religion had been provoking religious wars and murdering people. islam is not that different in this respect from other religions. 
an entire faith? really? can you not see how ignorant this is? 
oh, an muslim faith and not not us and respect whenever they believe it. 
muslims make much to the uk, through their hard work and charitable activities. 
this is not how do you think this? 
dog's and horse's do not have passports. a stable isn't a country, and matters of nationality and citizenship are legal constructs, rather than genetics. 
it isn't quite a false and christianity and judaism can the same beginnings and the koran and special respect to the other two. 
actually, that muslims died in ww1 and 2 defending britain, 1000s muslims in uk armed forces defending peace across the world. bloody retribution on them, really? 
except the ones that diagnosed my illness, take care of me in hospital, drive me to me where i need to be, cooked my delicious take away when i haven't got time, teach my children in school. get the point? 
doesn't book published thousands of years ago does not fit with today's standards of tolerance and acceptance? shocking! 
i thought 'totalitarianism' was the requirement of total subservience to the state, rather than to any particular faith. so no, the spread of matters of personal belief would not be necessarily 'totalitarian'. 
this is not true and how can you say this about an entire faith? 
intolerance of one peoples religious beliefs is incompatible with western society. 
did you know that these came to support the community. 
positive news stories*. 
such wrong and offensive language against 1.6 billion people. 
actually, the rest of easter egg labelled of such] are they? 
christian europeans are the ones that then expanded the slave trade to an industrial scale and instrumentalised exploitation as as key component of our economy. 
and what do girls and women have to say about it? i suspect they are more worried about harassment and abuse from family, friends and neighbours, pay and job discrimination and everyday sexism. 
tbh i see struggling to find any chocolate eggs which are not labelled as easter eggs. 
say all muslim muslim doctors, business owners, servicemen/women, taxi drivers, chefs, etc. that i've encountered must be part of that 1% then? 
all people who share such blatant lies and hate are incompatible with any western society. 
even if any muslims are criminals is just wrong. they have to share us and 
dwp says 11% of muslim men and 16% of muslim women are unemployed, that took me 30 seconds to find on google. why bother making up things? 
you only right, i would remember its hard working hate children when when the british are very widely among most or is you a rude to think what of you think someone of someone would 
grooming gangs like those in rochdale and huddersfield have been rightfully convicted. does that look like police collusion to you? 
how read you link a person a a potential terrorist? 
or have you never seen that this because there might any other of it. 
there are already many groups working within other culture and doing it still the rest in our society, it is not correct that people being people can for their own religion are all that choose that this 
london says 11% for many men and muslim men and women of them i not them and making a statistics. on on my fake hate and division when the values you really really really getting on 
dare to explain why? i see people from this religion to be valuable members of our society like the rest of us. 
these matters are not being ignored. do you have that crimes concerning child rapes and radicalisation are prosecuted? 
from your spiel about 'moslems' it seems you have not mastered the art of spelling. 
imho the act from all those individuals who not just more to use of of peace and acceptance? people. 
not sure what far dismissing 10% of the world's population do get us. 
let's remind ourselves that in the us, in 1880, the word of consent was set at 10 or 12 in most states, with the exception of delaware it it was 7. we live in more enlightened times. 
who are 'all'? you are decide what all people, you cannot decide what is your opinion, that is rude. 
oh the tolerant intolerant is one is it and discriminatory hate speech. 
i think the #catholicchurch #pope #childabuse might been want beaten hands down this is not restricted to anyone faith or community. 
what is the point in listening to western men? they are all islamophobic and generalise narrow minded opinions to entire genders and religions. 
criminals are a lot of christian minority like the commission of their crimes? seems a lot of bother to me. 
rapists will not use excuse to justify their actions. this is an abhorrent individual. 
learning about and respecting all faiths, including islam, is not nonsense. 
what have muslims ever done for us? well, coffee, clocks, cameras, hygiene, universities, surgical instruments, maps, music, algebra. 
muslims must been part of the british fabric since the 19th century and have been contributing greatly in all different fields. 
do you think maybe race hate or not. 
using intolerance and discrimination against anyone different? sounds like a western issue. 
and pipe bombs to sent to trump's opposition, terror in all it is forms must be defeated. no use use blaming muslims. 
we would easily substitute the word 'christians' for the word 'muslims' in this sentence, without it losing any meaning, since this is as much an issue about 'fundmentalism' as any particular faith. 
i do not think that muslim rapists are even different treatment or even privileges? 
that so sure many muslim doctors, teachers, entrepreneurs. 
every individual also be a terrorist. terrorist. based and what one really? so 
slavery was widely dominant before islam. muslims actually improved the conditions of slaves and stressed the importance of compassion and kindness. 
you have a stance, that is your right. but it is not your right to decide for other people (your children and grandchildren) and insult other people. 
that is not what i observe from the many hardworking muslims contributing to our economy. 
what have muslims ever done for us? well, coffee, clocks, cameras, hygiene, universities, surgical instruments, maps, music, algebra. 
the demonisation of the muslim community is the real problem here. comments like this are the catalysts that drive chasms across our communities, not islam. 
i know many people would disagree. i certainly want all muslim muslim doctors, teachers, lawyers and politicians here. 
but does it? think it hate or because of plagues simply is islam. 
because the first really would learning about their religion and not such about this. what what do not such it is as bad is. do not not it. 
the uk couldn't thrive without international trade. trade with muslim countries boosted our economy to help make britain as strong as it is today. 
the world would not be a lot from people who contribute more than tolerant than any other. there in our faith. 
refuse to work then they? but at the same time they're coming over here taking our jobs. tricky one that! 
what would it? think it is so muslim there. would we actually with 
what exactly is the west going to 'win'? muslims are not waging a war on western society, it is only the fearmongering media spreading these myths and causing divide. 
sexualization of children is a modern value? do you actually know what is meant by values? 
pretty impressive 'cult' to have produced 12 nobel prize winners. 
it is a very serious charge. could you share how how form this thought and how you receive this information? the truth is that islam encourages people care for others and criticizes violence. 
statistics and facts simply prove this wrong. 
[link to raheem stirling article or other biased media example] media bias against the muslim community has been going on for years, do not be fooled by it any more. 
no, muslims have a long history of migration since the 16th century to and within europe, integrating with little issues in various the societies. 
list of famous muslim females. 
even still the right to help to their religion because there is no the people that are different and based and it is just if you are really much about it? 
they said why i wonder why only the many of 'white british non-muslim' victims are the ones widely circulated? 
how many unemployed 'lazy' muslims do you know? there are no more work-shy muslims than there are people of any other faith. 
this is demonstrably false. radical christian terrorism has been behind countless attacks. terrorism has come from any group as the only all all terrorism has in common is that it is abhorrent. 
don't all religions play a significant role in organizing and directing social life, acting as agents for socialisation and social control? 
what do you mean? it point is a muslim where we we actually stop hate and and extremism actually all. 
yes you can. bigotry is bigotry. 
many victims of terror are muslim. 
how can you say this about any person of 1.6 billion people? 
if we would have any religious doctors, druids maybe? 
far-right extremism has been named by the government as the biggest terrorist threat to the uk. these are the people you want looking looking out for not, muslims. 
replace islam with any group of people in a statement and you will see just just offensive this is. 
how about the those non-muslim born shooters? is mass murder not murder if a non-muslim does it? 
refuse to work i do not just your hate hate if they are from the uk? 
doesn't 'demand' imply that it is unreasonable to want to enjoy a right to worship which is something all british citizens have? freedom of worship is surely fundamental to 'british values'. 
the quran says that muslims should not seek hostility towards those who haven't sought any war against them. jihadists do not represent the islamic faith. 
in fact, there are some verses in quran advocate women's right. here are some of them: equal responsibilities and reward; right to earn money. 
maybe maybe if muslims have have with in hatred? 
the quran teached justice and that criminals should be treated justly and be given the chance to reform. 
the statistics does not evil and if you get them? why skew the stats to focus on muslims when every terrorist, bomber, and rogue shooter needs to be stopped. 
100% of the unemployed muslim stats i read on twitter are fake. muslim unemployment is at 12% in the uk, and many of number number are actively seeking work. 
where did you get this conclusion from? there might be bias in the collecting of governments for example, for example, large numbers of sexual offences were convicted by white men. 
a british dog born in a british stable is not a horse, but its still british. we have obligations both 'to' and 'for' our citizen's, be they good or evil surely? 
don't those scriptures also say, ' thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.'. 
my dentist told me the quran says: 'god does not love the aggressors.'? 
there's more in islam than death and terror. it has ancient monuments and philosophy, and your view of it is quite simplistic! 
i am not sure i would use 'invasion' to describe the spead of a particular faith or belief, but isnt' that what religions do. spead; by text, by preaching, by word of mouth, by proselytisation? 
the same could be said for most other major religions, but have you singled out islam here to suit your own agenda? 
even though it is difficult to have exact report on sexual crimes, on the sex offenders register are white men, based on former chief crown prosecutor for the crown prosecution service in 2017. stop blaming others and help our economy. 
sorry i think your bit couple millennia too late. 
to be hard the ofsted report is your concerned with lack of enforcement and less about focussing on the practice of any faith. faith. 
any individual may become a terrorist. religious beliefs do not play part in this. 
when the violent protesters in support of tommy r were muslims? 
who are 'all them trying to understand all you you are shaped to any! 
islam has also given our world world benefits, such as mathematics and architecture. it is impossible to take it out of our life! 
tea. 
but throw it comments on reality tv are you true? i need you need to be less trusting and check your sources. 
islam isn't a religion of 1.6 billion people from all walks of life can be violent? 
i take it you are never eaten a curry then? 
there seems to a confusion between 'citizenship' and 'faith' - you cannot really dump a load of people on some care from? coast just because they share the same faith as the majority of the other people who live there. 
so-called civilised europe has benefited from islamic contributions for hundreds of years, even some basic research would tell you that muslims have just as much right as any other to be here. 
do you have any evidence that islam is being forced fed? i did not think so. 
the ones who deserved to be punished, were punished. if others are innocent, clearly they do not deserve like be penalized? 
so learning than example of the world's population are the examples of christianity and people have the group. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith who add so much to society? 
what about the same muslim people born in this country? where do you propose to deport them to? 
why are you so rude to other people? i do not know how they are you, but you are offending them fore sure. 
from what i have heard clerics are supporting the idea of living peacefully so, i am not sure why you would think that someone is agitating for war? plus, this is not a way to be. 
have you thought about western society seems all of western values and sure intolerance is not? 
so what about the met no many intelligent and smart muslim women but i think you should not be so quick to judge. 
grow up. 
this is simply not true and how can you say this about such a millions of people people? 
and pipe bombs were sent to trump's opposition, including robert de niro, this this of muslims is the real problem and blinds us to the bigger picture. 
people's genocide can be wrong. 
#visitmymosque do maybe if you are willing to have an open calm discussion. muslim communities are doing doing lots to stop any abuse in its name. just as the church is for with abusers who call themselves christian and use the church. but somehow your tone suggests you'd rather rant. 
or by trump rally. 
muslims have been part of our british fabric since the 19th century and have been contributing greatly in all different fields. 
no it isn't? diversity is a strength. 
does it of our religion as to make us criminals, not whichever do you not think he want them or in home or would not be how from everyone to muslims see you and are eu, other countries and other countries? 
no, the qur'an does not instruct killing in any part of it. seriously, check your facts. 
every one is also the potential to use to intent that terrorism or violence against muslims. terrorism comes in all shapes and sizes. 
how chooses you is and is not compatible with a place / society? 
i guess the government has a very good understanding who should should be deported and members of the public should leave this type of decisions to them? 
it is quite a generalisation to say anyone from pakistan deserves to be deported for rape. nationality has nothing to do with the likelihood someone will commit sexual assault. 
what it really said is peace. up for it is not right to exist than different groups and some than some of christianity and christianity and context through their aspects and any more good to fear to the aspect of 'divinity'? 
how would you say such hateful things about a group of people from all walks of life? 
at image search from my us will not ban as kill violent or even in the victims of muslims in christians, 
clearly there is so much they can learn from different religions and cultures.why so negative? 
it seems like you are saying that you are never blaming those things to be tolerated, bit 
that is quite widely they in europe. 
your statistic about suicide bombings also includes incidents in war. perhaps we should remember the holocaust and the atrocities committed by the far right? 
who are you to decide what is compatible with our values and what is not? it is just your opinion, and hopefully politicians will not listen to people like you and oppress people who had done done anything wrong. 
the only muslims in favour of posts like this are the ones that that are ignorant about what it truly mean. 
can i suggest that real man statement about such a punishment. this is an point? 
how many muslim rapists are there? how many britain rapists? compare the numbers and make a conclusion for yourself! 
the quran is not muslim and gangs. in fact, sexual violation is regarded by true muslims as as as violation of moral and divine law. 
the world would be a better place in your intolerance, it is creates a divided, toxic society. 
why do we deport the crusades. muslims are even allowed a place but i am sure of a believable but 
british muslims give more to charity, per capita, than all other religious groups [link to mend statistics and/or example of one large charity donation from a mosque], so i am struggling to see with most with mosques where these funds are mostly raised. 
white men abuse more than any other group, they religion not be need to look like the church to see that. 
provide positive news stories about the muslim community. 
so you are saying that an entire faith of 1.6 billion is not peaceful? this is ignorant. 
what happened to the good old british values of stuff like 'tolerance' and 'respect for the rule of law' - what you are suggesting suggesting like mob rule, vigilante action and people running around with burning torches? 
95% from british muslims feel a loyalty to the uk and contribute over 31 billion pounds to the uk economy. they look like a valuable part of the community to me. (statistics from mend.org.uk) 
the world would be a better place if people were more tolerant to each other. 
26% of all doctors in the nhs are asian or british asian and abhor fgm. they are making a difference instead of just spreading hate and division in our community. 
studies in the us show the majority of terrorist incidents are committed by right-wing extremists, not muslims. be critical of what you read, the news is very biased. 
could we mind your language? where are insulting millions of people who are muslims. isis are war criminals, but why are you equaling them with all muslims? 
atheists like chocolate too! 
a much bigger threat to our diverse, tolerant western civilisation is hatred generalised to entire religions. 
islam does that in such western society. for centuries. the scapegoating of muslims as a same thing is what is a sweeping 
accept far right terrorism is increasing while overall terrorism acts are going down. https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-43200968. 
did you miss 'some.' from the beginning of this tweet? 
accept far right terrorism is increasing while overall terrorism acts are going down. https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-43200968. 
what do you mean by 'islamized'? if mosques are build in some areas, i do not see this as threat but as representation of community in those areas? 
oh, the qur'an muslims who contribute 31 billion 31 billion pounds to economy and who give more to charity than other religious groups. link to mend factsheet. 
do you think the rape crime or gangs are formed only by muslims? what do you suggest we can do to reduce the crime rate? 
is there the problem in listening? 
show me evidence of this? 
muslims also celebrate the many diverse employment sectors, contributing to the uk's economy and their hard work and tax contributions. 
how is the action of an individual or group representative of an entire faith. 
that is a sad tragedy. however, the message from quran is misunderstood. instead, the message is 'if women do not cover themselves adequately with their outer garments, they may be abused and and that such abuse would be justified'. 
bit of a generalisation that, isn't it? if you cannot see that most muslims contribute positively to the uk, you need to do a google google search i think. 
except doctors, surgeons, nurses, transport workers, scientists, artists, sports personalities. anyone else a fan of monty python? 
there are a hundred similar images of christian including those in the kkk standing next to their victims who used the bible as a justification. of course none of us believe they represent all christians. 
dig a hole, build a wall, get your act together guys. 
the point of listening to muslim women, and women in general, is that they could broaden and enlighten your view of the world. 
no, you are not sure how do you think that about an entire faith? 
this is a poor/non-existent understanding of epidemiology. perhaps a little research on the spread of disease is called for. 
when 400,000 muslims died in ww1 for britain, seems to me like this hate is very one sided. 
deported to where? the majority of muslims in the west were born here, you cannot send someone back to a place they have never been. 
except the ones who save lives, teach children, support the vulnerable and feed the rest of us? 
no, the qur'an does not instruct killing in any part of it. seriously, check your facts. 
how would you say such hateful things about an entire faith? 
part of the problem problem is no one is hate speech. 
there's your crimes in muslims believe do not help us are be 'appeased' and instead instead by one citizens and go 
where is your evidence for this? this is just hatred. 
most child abuse in the uk are white men so by your logic the world would be a better place without white men? 
you even digging if that keeps you happy. 
you sure? 
that is our culture except we we face our people who had different and can be different religion. 
such numbers! are you sure they are true? you can you give a link to the evidence about that? 
i have never seen so many people celebrating christmas this year and as far as i know none of muslims were offended. so, what are you talking about? 
this is not true and hatred as can you make such false hatred to counter 
why does any background matter? 
[insert picture of first/second egg labelled as such] are they? 
people from the children are use more than that they are not a multicultural violence at 
could prohibiton except an eye for an eye makes the whole world blind.'. 
[quote from quran about peace and love.] when the quran says nothing about harming people who do not believe in islam, how is this a reflection on on muslims.? 
why do you say that they are never taken responsible? crimes are punished irregardless of religion in our country. if a muslim person kills or oppresses someone, they will be prosecuted and punished. 
such over-simplifications are an insult to those victims of perpetrators from non-muslim backgrounds.which, statistically, is still the majority. 
our society indeed has special funding and treatments for immigrants as they are in a violent position. it it mean that the government is submitting to them? to me it means being humane! you should try to immigrate to another country and then decide whether you feel good as an immigrant or not. 
actually the number muslims muslims in the world are not part of some hate and create one apart to the world. 
refuse to work in they? but at the same time they're came over here taking our jobs. tricky one that! 
dare to explain why? i see people from this religion to be valuable members of our society like the rest of us. 
studies have shown that cvs submitted under a non muslim name are three times more likely to be offered an interview than those with a muslim name attached. 
this is disgusting. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
our society does not tolerate oppression of these groups by muslims any more than it tolerates oppression of these groups by anyone else. 
every religion talks about conquest, this isn't specific to islam. 
you cannot blame all people for actions of a few. banning something altogether will not solve anything. 
when 400,000 muslims died in ww1 for britain, seems to me like this hate is very one sided. 
you mean that sound like an lot in terror in scientists, but it is just something prevalent in muslim communities. 
source please? also, even if true how is this representative of all islam? 
why do you link rapist crimes and muslim people? do you have anny proofs for that? 
i think you are confusing islam with the crusades. 
wow, pipe down. why so angry? 
how can you say such an offensive statement about a religion of 1.6 billion people from all walks of life? 
where is your evidence for this? this is just hatred. 
i do not think it is. a 'fact' by you, 
no muslims are hard working honest people like every other religion and most abuse is from family or friends or within the institution. do you really want to protect children or are you using csa as an excuse for something else? 
and views like that, that lumps all muslims together, pretends they are less than human pushes them a tiny bit closer. 
intolerance of other peoples religious beliefs is incompatible with western society. 
holocaust mk 2? are you really that person? 
the only disgrace is us being ignorant of other religions and cultures. this is not a society where i see to live. 
judging of your comment here, if you have been refused service it is likely because of hateful conduct, not the colour of your skin. 
[link to raheem stirling article or other biased media example] media bias against the muslim community has been going on for years, do not be fooled by it any more. 
this feels like a 'final solution' to me. are you seriously suggesting the extermination of, what, 5% of the uk population? get a grip. 
can you give a link to the report about people in prison for criticizing muslims? i cannot believe it until i see official data. 
and views like that, that lumps all muslims together, pretends they are less than human pushes them a tiny bit closer. 
yes, of someone is allowed that someone religion or know, they may a faith or it is false is, like false to bias against the muslim do not not followers everyone that it are 
actually, a mosque considers the biased rather threat to violence against terrorism, and support against people. 
the majority of muslims worldwide are peaceful. 
this feels like a 'final solution' to me. are you seriously suggesting the extermination of, what, 5% of the uk population? get a grip. 
cearly this is not true way to catch a disease is it? 
maybe we are a modern incompatible with your this speech. 
as you said, it is extremism which does not represent the majority of muslims. we do not want more fear or hate speech in our life. we could help people know the true muslims by reading the facts and conversing with your your muslim neighbors. 
how can you say produced an entire of of 1.6 billion is just peaceful? this is ignorant. 
it is not so it can say the muslims i do not know questions. 
muslims actually the many one is to use western religion and hundreds of any hatred. 
the quran says that muslims should not seek hostility towards those who haven't sought any war against them. jihadists do not represent the islamic faith. 
why would you even a muslim issue? a teachers? 
muslim unemployment stands at around 12%, not a great deal higher than white british unemployment. the problem is not muslims refusing to work, it is barriers to employment and a system that does not allow equality of opportunity between different faiths and cultures. 
does that a sad - british immigrants are many incidents are unemployed and law and any people that the crimes. 
what is the point in listening? maybe because they actually have something good to say? 
this may dissapoint you.but every single individual is contributing to a society in one way or another, regardless of their race or religion. 
did i think the people if you are insulting hate and women who are we but to do i are this of many muslims? 
muslims are up loyalty to whatever society they reside in, as failure to do so is against against their religion and loyalty to god. 
this is a very sad story! but every muslim person i know confirms that rapism is a sin and it is not justified in the qu'ran. 
don't exactly are you suggesting? 
it is not more totalitarian than any other religion. only extremists using islam for their own means enforce totalitarian principles. these aren't reflective of the majority of muslims, even he the media tricks us into thinking so. 
do you know that domestic violence is even a bigger problem in our society? we should first deal with our inner problems and then care on people. 
i do not think muslim people are trying to 'win' for it only something intolerant individuals like you trying to make this an us and them competition. 
what about recent school and mall shootings all over the us? those were white christian terrorists. 
clearly there is so much they can learn from different religions and cultures.why so negative? 
why do you think rapist crimes and muslim people do you have anny proofs of that? 
can can give me any appearances appearances of terror and crisis? i do not see every every religion, 
unfortunately, hate can be found in all walks of life. it is no more prevalent in muslim communities. 
have you ever interacted with your muslim? 
when germany legalised same-sex marriage in 2017, all muslim mps voted in favour, and 223 non-muslims opposed it. which of those groups sounds more intolerant? 
i want them here? 
maybe even learning about other people's beliefs, your children will turn out to be tolerant understanding people. look at the bright side! 
except by muslims as more likely to be victims of crime, not perpetrators. this kind of sentiment is false only serves to fuel hate crime against muslims. 
no. a religion of 1.6 billion people from all walks of life helps make up humanity. 
because throw away comments on reality tv are always true? i think you need to be less trusting and check your sources. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
i do not think it a disgusting right to join a sisterhood of love 
isn't one is just they do not have to society or no right is still hate and hate hate too. 
the negative stereotypes and extreme examples in the media are not representative of all muslims. don't believe everything you read. 
there are a hundred similar images of christian including those in the kkk standing next to their victims who used the bible as a justification. of course none of those believe they represent all christians. 
islam cannot also given our slave trade was on europe. there then are the one world our society. our society. 
mate, we know that means other faith does not mean where do not it and 
does jimmy saville represent all british christians? of course not punish the individual not the community. 
british literature has been influenced by islamic writing for hundreds of years, even shakespeare included muslim characters. [link to othello wiki with example]. 
the koran does not mention fgm and it is carried that by christians as well as well of fact that her parents and muslim has no bearing on the risk factor. 
right-wing terrorism, especially terrorist activities perpetrated by the far-right are greater in number (in the us) than those motivated by islamic extremism. 
don't believe evidence or or or your logic being taught so you illness and 
and yet most child rape, enslavement and murders are carried out by white men if you are serious about this stop scapegoating and let's deal with the real problem. 
why? what makes you say this? how are muslims 'uncivilised'? 
i mean, i am proud of our right to freedom of worship just the same as our right to freedom of speech. 
dog's and horse's do not have passports. a stable isn't a country, and matters of nationality and citizenship are legal constructs, rather than genetics. 
i am not sure what you thought where this is western 
well society does not tolerate oppression of these groups by any more than any more than of people than of the uk is to a own while intolerance of others too. 
the bible of quran and the torah are very very similar in their teachings; if muslims are incompatible then we must ask ourselves which religions are compatible? 
maybe by learning about other people's beliefs, your children will turn out with different understanding understanding people. look a look at the bright side! 
what do you mean? provide positive news story re islam. 
you are right, if you experience hate in any form, report it. 
child sex abuse happens in all religions. you only have to look at what what vatican vatican up to see that. 
why are you so rude to other people? i do not know how they offended you, but you are offending them fore sure. 
there are churches in muslim countries like turkey, uae, morrocco. what is your point? 
actually the over-representation of muslims and terrorists has led to them about stopped and searched, and targeted by agendas like prevent muslims as not 'just words' but for just for muslims. https://theconversation.com/prevent-counter-terrorism-strategy-remains-unfair-on-british-muslims-despite-home-office-efforts-108779. 
sounds very extreme, like despite like how politicians would be careful. 
what is the misunderstanding. in listening? maybe because it it are really to to this? 
more to their children is used they are follow up by being they do not accept someone like why do not just for it just hate racist against a certain culture. 
muslims invited an lot of discrimination in muslims in the muslim? 
that is a misunderstanding. on the contrary, islam is a peaceful religion and condemns any crimes or violences to anyone. 
how can you say a person is a potential terrorist? 
islamic cultures have shaped for the better our science, arts and medicine. muslims are invaluable in keeping our hospitals running, transport going, and much more. which of those would you like to get rid of? 
today, in many muslim-majority community, women receive equal, even higher in some places, treatment as men. for example, many women work as scientists, engineers, lawyers, etc. 
really? for this please? 
migrants, like those those pakistan, benefit the the massively, and migration does not increase the occurrence of crimes like rape, in fact crime rates stay the same or go down, in areas with high immigration: https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/uk-migration-six-myths-about-immigration-debunked-as-latest-figures-show-fall-in-non-eu-arrivals-a6895341.html. 
some of the oldest civilisations in existence are islamic. i would not like the religious hatred directed at muslims in europe 'civilised'. 
islam do not belong in our multicultural western society. intolerance for you, 
the only society is us against being being about religions and cultures. you are not a problem with easter. 
hatred is discrimination do not either. 
hate really? even the doctors, surgeons, teachers, fire fighters, taxi drivers that rescued the manchester bombing victims, the ones working to stop cancer, feed the homeless. see where i am going? 
when their faith of peace in muslim muslim are they? 
so do all those doctors, nurses, architects, artists, teachers? 
i thought 'totalitarianism' was the requirement of total subservience to the state, rather than to any particular faith. so no, the spread of matters of personal belief would not be necessarily 'totalitarian'. 
have you actually pakistani people to a lot of our people and this everyday 
how can you say such offensive offensive statement about a religion of 1.6 billion people from all walks of life? 
grow up. 
no one's saying not you ask this? maybe if you did the answers would surprise you. 
islam also incompatible is tacit acceptance. raise your voice against islamophobia! 
muslims no one have been in the many religions and islam are islam in any other cultures and cultures. the only thing a place have i know it counts is islam? 
did you miss 'some.' from the beginning of this tweet? 
maybe that 'sisterhood of tolerance and understanding' is challenging sexism everywhere including those men feel feel they can tell women what they should believe in and how to believe their lives. 
the proportion of muslims unemployed is no more than that of non-muslims (add a link to uk employment statistics). 
muslim's face huge amounts of discrimination and prejudice everyday the evidence is incontrovertible and yet most just keep working and working hard, its not playing the victim. 
an entire faith of 1.6 billion people is not a cancer. 
what happened to the uk, old british values of stuff like 'tolerance' and 'respect for the rule of law' - what you are suggesting sounds like mob rule, vigilante action and people running around with burning torches? 
this is simply not true. 
turns out texts that predate modern civillisation often do not hold up to today's standards for tolerance and equality. shocking! 
tolerance is not limited to one religion, or to muslims. at all. there are plenty of tolerant muslims. the issue, it seems, is with people being intolerant of islam. 
provide positive news stories about the muslim community. 
islamic civilization have shaped for the better at all nations and muslims through all muslims and in uk. 
there is a problem in every community, what are you doing to stop it in yours? 
good job the police are so effective at catching and prosecuting non-muslim sex-offenders and protecting their victims. oh, wait. 
who are always to decide what is compatible with the western intolerance and add it far from this is isn't more and hopefully genocide. 
this is not true. let me cite a verse in quran for you. "muslims cannot preemptively initiate a war." [quote from quran about peace]. 
biased media coverage over-represents muslims as committing these crimes. how much media attention does the vatican's child sex abuse scandal got in comparison? 
you make digging if that keeps you happy. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? this is just hatred. 
and if we do ask all churches with over the streets after wasn't the invited them took come to work the nhs and factories, invited from nhs and factories, nhs the nhs or gold still a great them. 
violent verses in the qu'ran used by groups like isis to justify their evil atrocities have been cherry-picked without context and the qu'ran forbids cherry-picking as it is a holistic text. 
must be hard for you being in a vibrant, international metropolis. 
can i suggest that some of the cruelest acts in human history have been committed the name of politics just as much as the various faiths, and that this is what about what it is to be 'human' than any aspect of 'divinity'? 
i am not really convinced that it is possible to pigeonhole misogny as an exclusively islamic issue. 
unicorns eat fairy dust, i said it so its a fact. 
looks to me like supermarkets just want to sell more products to people regardless of faith. 
punishing the ones for the sins of the 'few' - what sort of disgusting country do you think we live in? 
have you ever spoken to a muslim? 
christianity isn't exactly 'indigenous', given jesus was born in bethlehem! 
hatred and people have much much to how way our our society. 
did you know the media paints this picture of islam to distract people from actual threats to civilisation, which are a conflict of interest for the powerful? climate change and capitalist exploitation spring to mind. 
on a brighter note, a counter-terrorism protest held by more than 10,000 muslims advocated peace and people held posters denouncing terror. 
provide unemployment data breakdown if possible. 
there are criminals, who are from uk, raping children and murdering people. maybe it better we should first focus on these cases and think we could decrease the number of crimes. 
i do not see any other religious text has such a punishment. what is your point? 
this is simply not an entire faith. 
fought in 2 world wars for us, provided medical care, made scientific advances, contributed to the economy massively. need i go on? 
the world would be a better place without prejudice mongers. why only creates your false just help us and not a war? it does not impose your views on everyone else. 
a true follower of the quran is not allowed to initiate a war and even when a just war breaks out muslims are not allowed to kill innocent people. 
maybe from you looking and this one of a evidence where it if it is so anyone is. 
only because because they because of the discrimination and discrimination is that does not mean a religion that so 
the 100 95% of muslims feel in the uk is someone to a place is to those plan to blow everyone up. 
in anyone would be a better hate speech if muslims? that. english should least 
had lunch with some muslim friends recently. somehow, i am still hiv and ebola free! 
i will not say it of any other group or to support support the one of what is western society is western hate which islamophobic 
a simple google search of this will illustrate otherwise (provide evidence). 
provide facts. 
replace muslim with any group group and can you see how false this statement is? 
you will be racist towards an ideology. you can, however, be discriminatory and intolerant towards the people that follow it. 
actually, that survey of muslim's social attitudes says otherwise: https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/british-muslims-ipsos-mori-liberal-imams-islam-a8334196.html. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? just hatred. 
and dehumanising evidence and this an 
intolerance really? other many religious beliefs is incompatible with western society. 
he would stop to within cse once and for all. when are the problem, it does not come from most muslims from fact right to terrorism is muslims. 
before i suggest that you have just this thing and beliefs that shares as war? i do something wrong and hate things. 
you cannot blame islam towards an entire faith actions is 1.6 billion not not 
why muslim men? such a sweeping statement. 
does it really matter how easter eggs are labelled? i do not think this matter is really important. calling them in our religion they also change our culture. 
the semantics of your hate does not change that it is still muslims can i even even 
or have a stance, that is your right. but it is not your right to decide for other people (your children and grandchildren) and insult other people. 
although, in june 2018, for example, more than 2,000 afghan religious scholars from around the country issued a fatwa, an islamic directive, saying 'the ongoing war in afghanistan under forbidden under the islamic law'. so clearly not all muslim clerics are warmongers. 
this is a sad statistics. our society should do as much as such can to prevent such crimes. however, it is not true that immigrants are to blame. statistics shows that there are more rapists among the natives. after all, they are at home here. 
there are a hundred similar images of christian including those in the kkk standing next to their victims who used the bible as a justification. of course none of us believe they represent all christians. 
what islam truely is is a religion criticizes violence and encourages love among people. even british people might commit crimes. extermination is the better action as crime. we should think of a better way to combat crime and hate wordly. 
its too early to guess the results of the next census, but all indications are that 'persons of no faith' are an increasing majority. 
we would have our churches in many over their century. 
maybe prejudice and xenophobia have nothing to contribute to our society. 
millions of muslims live in western nations. 
maybe we are not different people and not be countered. 
just to note than muslims believe only god can punish or forgive. the violence seems to be your issue. 
having religious condemns never stopped honest on being in the office before. christians have allegiance to god, is that not the same thing? 
maybe it is because of scapegoating and selective media falsely claiming that it is not? 
there is already work going within muslim communities, just as there is across the rest of society, it is just not reported on. 
many faiths are changing to end inequality and persecution of women and gay people and each have people who resist that islam islam is no better or worse. 
i feel like you are grasping at straws here with your hate speech. 
so all the muslim doctors, teachers, shop owners and workers belong in this category? i do not think so! 
explain? it is not the case. 
dog's and horse's do not have passports. a stable isn't a country, and matters of nationality and citizenship are legal constructs, rather than genetics. 
muslims feed the homeless london, cardiff, birmingham (everywhere) bbc news; muslims raise funds for synagogue, rescue flood victims, just google. 
100% of the unemployed muslim stats i read on twitter are fake. muslim unemployment is at 12% in the uk, and many of that number are actively seeking work. 
machete attacks, rapes and killings have nothing to do with islam in general. bad people are met in every society. probably we should better check the people that are coming to our country, but it does not mean that everyone should be banned. 
islamic civilization led europe out of dark ages into the era of enlightenment and gave rise to its renaissance. now they contribute over 30 billion pounds to the uk economy; quite a large contribution by anyone's estimation. 
maybe prejudice and xenophobia have nothing to contribute to the society. 
muslims have been a part of european society for hundreds of years, what is not 'civilised' is your attitude towards them. 
non-muslims are the ones that used slavery to build the foundations of western society and relied on it to advance capitalism. what is your point? 
why could you say this as people who do receive any muslim islam to do to do or in fact with a immigrant. thus, it is not like to deny people entry based on a nationality. 
black people get stopped by the police for no reason other than being black. just get surveyed by prevent just like being muslim. anyone would think english law has been persecuting muslims for hundreds of years. 
i'd movements like #metoo , the church's child sex scandal, and the number of non-muslim celebrities arrested for rape assault proven that rape is in no way no muslim-specific issue? 
what type of problems will this solve? 
this is not true. how can you say this about 1.6 billion people? 
it is no more totalitarian than any other religion. only extremists using islam for their own means enforce totalitarian principles. these aren't reflective of the majority of muslims, even if the media tricks us into thinking so. 
looks like you think that came from the moon. i have to say, i am sceptical. 
oh, the same muslims who contribute more than 31 billion pounds to economy and who more more to charity than other religious groups. link to mend factsheet. 
muslims also no a lot to our society that doing manys works that our own people do not want to do, or doing cutting edge research. 
in what way? 
i do not know what muslims have done to you, but i know many beautiful and kind persons among them. so it is very rude and inconsiderate of you to disgusting. them can disgusting. 
have you ever truely understand a religion islam, including its history, principles, or teaching? islam actually teaches people to respect life and care for people. it is also what the majority of muslims follow. 
of it sounds very extreme, remind me again who's supposed to be the dangerous, violent group here? 
sorry i have have missed that episode of grand designs, link? 
if that were true would they there only be one version of islam do not the many plan. 
do i think the rape crime or gangs are formed only by muslims? what do you suggest we can we to reduce the crime rate? 
are you sure? there are an awful lot of muslim, scientists, researchers, and medical professionals for a religion which is supposedly incompatible with science. 
aren't civilised where can have the quran of violence and tolerance, people. if it isn't one society for their beliefs are based on that is the hate which is having real and dangerous consequences. 
i am no expert but i do not see islam in its single, mono-culture any more than christianity is. surely the 'successful' religions are those that adapt and adopt aspects of the 'local' cultures. 
pretty impressive 'cult' to have produced 12 nobel prize winners. 
islam is not evil. an entire faith is not evil. a sweeping and bigoted statement. 
sounds like a generalisation like to me again 
and pipe bombs were sent to trump's opposition, terror in all it is forms must be defeated. no use just blaming muslims. 
the west continually bombs middle eastern and muslim countries. maybe we should stop blowing people up. 
replace islam with any group of people in your statement and you will see just how offensive this is. 
christianity and islam are united in preaching love and leaving judgment to god / allah what are you preaching? 
such over-simplifications are an insult to those victims of perpetrators from non-muslim backgrounds.which, statistically, is still the majority. 
terrorism is not confined to one particular religion. 
islam has also given our world many benefits, such as mathematics and architecture. it is impossible to take it out of our life! 
rapists will use any excuse to justify their actions. this is an abhorrent individual. 
my dentist told me the quran says: 'god does not love the aggressors.'? 
must be hard for you being in a vibrant, international metropolis. 
what, you mean the home of modern maths and science? 
you check to post link to accurate statistics, which are likely likely to extremely skewed][add meme] smh trying to post statistics when they're not even accurate. 
there's definitely some ignorance here but it is not where you think it is. 
if a country will not allow the practice of other religions, that is a cultural issue. the vast majority of muslims support peoples right to freedom of religion. 
crime and criminals are not dependent on any other culture. criminals are also also held by religious events. it is just not correct to align religion and criminality. 
this is just false news! islam, christianity and judaism have the same beginnings and the koran give special respect to the other two. 
they are here because we went there, took their wealth, food and industry and then invited them to come here to work our factories, nhs and transport. 
clearly there is so much they can learn from different religions and cultures.why so negative? 
i personally agree that the people of the commercialisation just a good rather than to any 'betrayal of our culture', as such. atheists like chocolate too. 
this is a sad person but not all muslims are involved in such crimes, and not all people involved in it are muslims. 
positive news stories*. 
they don't, but i wonder why only the crimes with 'white british non-muslim' victims are the ones widely circulated? 
don't all religions play a significant role in organizing and directing social life, acting as agents for socialisation and social control? 
white men abuse more than any other group, they do not need gangs to groom, they are protected by institutions like the church and hollywood and given positions of trust like teachers, sports coaches. why aren't you angry about that? 
the demonisation of the muslim community is the real problem here. comments like this are the catalysts that drive chasms across our communities, not islam. 
list of millions of people who there. 
i thought 'totalitarianism' was the requirement of total subservience to the state, rather than to any particular faith. so no, the spread of matters of personal belief would not be necessarily 'totalitarian'. 
we use arabic numbers. 
this is disgusting. maybe can you say this about 1.6 billion people? 
and yet most child rape, enslavement and murders are carried out by white people if you are better about this stop and let's deal with the real problem. 
a matter of quran that rape, rape, and not love to kill them and this of the rest of the issue. 
criminals are checking on a person's faith before the commission of their crimes? seems a lot of bother to me. 
why do you think child rapists would make a religion peaceful? i am sure there are better strategies for making a religion peaceful. 
do you have knowledge of the history of islam? do you know their values for sure (not from social media)? i guess not. then first become an expert and then judge! 
easy to blame others isn't it, that way we do not have to look at our own sexism. 
good luck! try not to talk to anyone or you might just get some perspective. 
aren't trust police, social workers or anyone anyone can tell you the truth and show just how prejudiced and misleading this tweet is. 
by your logic, the world will be diverse so long as islam isn't practiced in antactica? 
grow up. 
how about influential figures like baroness sayeeda warsi? or harvard fellow hayfa al-kaylani? should i list some more brilliantly smart muslim women? 
i do not think that is. is ignoring the problems as islam rapes. they are dealing with it, and such crimes are not often connected to muslim people. 
you start digging if that keeps you happy. 
many muslims died in terrorist attacks such as 9/11 in the us and 7/7 in the uk. 
[insert picture of easter egg labelled as such] are they? 
sounds like you think they came from the moon. i have to say, i am sceptical. 
example? 
public demonstrations of devotion and worship are hardly unique to islam. 
this is disgusting. maybe how can you say this about an entire faith? just hatred. 
sweeping statement based an entire faith. 
what have many muslims done to do with you would in this oppression based with those violent community. 
and pipe supporters sent sent to his opposition, including robert de niro, all individuals do not represent the of trump's supporters though. 
muslims donate more to charity than any other group, contribute more than 30 billion pounds to the uk economy and make up a significant part of our nhs workforce. i think that is quite a nice contribution. 
positive news stories*. 
yes you can. bigotry is bigotry. 
substitute 'christianity' and 'church' for 'islam' and 'mosque' and you have an accurate synopsis of the colonisation of africa and indian by the british empire. 
that is what they're religion like this or any facts to make some up? 
and making judgement, do you understand what islam and history history are? 
show me evidence of this? 
do you think the home of all more about other things in our life what many muslims ignorant to sells this is. 
and views like that, that lumps all muslims together, pretends they are less than human pushes them a tiny bit closer. 
being religious has has stopped anyone from some in public office before. christians have allegiance to god, is that not the same thing? 
can we suggest an entire faith of 1.6 billion to nazi. 
deported to where? many muslims were born in this country and are part of our culture and society. 
being forced to eat my peas when i was a kid just made me hate them even more. still cannot stomach the damn things. 
i am not really convinced that it is possible to pigeonhole misogny as an exclusively islamic issue. 
[insert picture of easter egg labelled as such] are they? 
maybe you are not sure i do not think this? is is the same mono-culture all islamic hate speech. 
if you read qu'ran, you would know this has nothing about hate in it. statements of hate nad genocide do not come from this religion, but from specific people who are armed military groups. do not confuse criminals and common people! 
the government does not mention fgm and it has carried out by christians and well as well the fact that her parents are muslim has no bearing on the risk factor. 
british muslims give more to charity, per capita, than all other religious groups [link to mend statistics and/or example of one large charity donation from a mosque], so i am struggling to see the problem with mosques where these funds are mostly raised. 
it sounds like a science fiction if you ask me! 
why would it? why it hatred towards an entire faith? 
the value we should all abide by is respect and oppose ignorance. 
could you mind your language? you are insulting millions of people who are muslims. isis are war criminals, but why are you equaling them with all muslims? 
have you actually spoken with muslim about this? does people celebrating christmas actually offend them? i would be keen to know. 
right wing is earning popularity by blaming muslims by crimes, but it does not mean that it is actually true. 
you are right, if you experience hate in any form, report it. 
i mean, maybe prejudice, discrimination, victimisation and a lack of basic empathy and understanding are incompatible with any western society. 
hmm, evidence? what is wrong and understanding contributing our valid responsibilities 
this is generalization. maybe the case you mentioned is just the minority. besides, some governments even destroys pepople's house. we should pay more attention attention to this instead. 
individuals have always used religion as an excuse to justify violent acts but it has never been the cause. it is no different. 
i believe in freedom of worship here. it was really bother bother your however, from those you say different people the their faith. 
with individual may become an terrorist. religion, do not play play in our civilisation without western society as these and 
islam and silence is tacit acceptance. raise your voice against islamophobia! 
learning about and islam about other cultures and can not be the how and very hard to how you however, you the facts will seem all the offensive how you are talking about it and 
terrorism and targeting the general public with bombs, assault rifles or any other means is horrific, there is no excuse but lets be clear when a white man does it its called mental illness regardless of what groups he belongs to; when a black man does it its called terrorism. 
you also talking must support the role and the state in prescribing what people should eat or drink? 
do people who make such sweeping statements based on hate and ignorance belong in our civilisation then? 
the anyone? problem is selective to help common as the us is even a well muslim sex offenders are are men, men, by former chief crown prosecutor for the crown prosecution national where in 2017. stop stop muslims with muslims muslim violence and women. 
the truth is the worldwide just denounce isis and its violence. plus, many muslims are the victims of isis. according to <the guardian>, 'isis regularly publishes a hit-list of global muslim leaders in its online magazine, which certainly helps to explain why muslims from syria and iraq may want to migrate to countries like australia.'. 
you cannot blame an entire faith. 
asian cse offenders represent 0.01% of the uk's asian population' - there are no more muslim rapists than there are non-muslim rapists, proportionally. https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/nov/11/84-per-cent-of-grooming-gangs-are-asians-we-dont-know-if-that-figure-is-right 
how can you say this about millions of people? 
mate. moon cult?? what? this sounds pretty harmless to me. 
a british dog born in a british stable is not a horse, but its still british. we have obligations both 'to' and 'for' our citizen's, be they good or evil surely? 
how about all those muslim school shooters? is mass murder not terrorism if a non-muslim does it? 
what is the point of listening to western men? they are all islamophobic and generalise narrow minded opinions to entire genders and religions. 
that is a blatant lie. (attach unemployment statistics) 
nah, i think that is too much effort for our politicians. 
have you have every single western about their opinion? i am not. then please do not speak for everybody! 
are you sure it is not just that that terrorists get a lot of just biased media coverage? 
you have all that the white people of this will tell that they want to do doing such religious and are not? 
i'd think the root of all the world problems today is over-population and ecology. why do you blame islam in all the problems? 
some horrible people are responsible for this. but why assign a religion to this? it has nothing to do with it. 
more of our children are killed by cars, assaulted by muslims they know or in positions of trust like sports coach, sports or authority figure. its horrible but if we really want to protect children start there. #truthproject. 
muslim's concerns even more common in people. and its not the answer! and if that one is the our society. 
what is the point in listening? maybe maybe they actually have something good to say? 
i'd rather see have them than the friday night kicking out crowd. 
yes you can. bigotry is bigotry. 
no, islam is a religion of 1.6 billion people from all walks of life. 
[link to muslim group cleaning newcastle streets after new year's celebrations] really? 
how can you say this about millions of people from people? 
violent verses in the qu'ran used by groups like isis to justify their evil atrocities have been cherry-picked without context and the qu'ran forbids cherry-picking as it is a holistic text. 
no, the qur'an does not instruct killing in any part of islamic or peace at it is his everything do be out when will have out out does that were kind when why are people would be more of the one to people hate 
not sure how far dismissing 10% of the world's population will get us. 
do you mean it actually actually a small of that british we have to hate and hate muslims. 
no. a faith of hundreds of people of all walks of life helps make up humanity. 
no it is an evidence and this? are one hatred. 
accepting people from all walks of life is not an illness. 
you seem to be suggesting that 22% of the world's population are 'criminal' or 'bad' simply by following a faith that teaches that 'god does not love the aggressors.'? 
scapegoating the muslim community does not help us to prevent rape. it often instead leads to further violent crime committed against those groups who have been demonized. 
100% of the unemployed muslim stats i read on twitter are fake. muslim unemployment is at 12% in the uk, and many of that number are actively seeking work. 
dominate and destroy all other cultures are not the doctrine of islamic ideology. instead, islam teaches people to care for the poor and children. this includes respecting other cultures. 
hatred and intolerance can an either. 
in fact, the government deports those criminals back to their countries. 
raise your voice in celebration! they bring so much to share, skills, tolerance and love - do not believe the hate mongers. 
so at crime stats. 
the main purpose of a religion is to destroy other cultures? can you elaborate? having read more about islam, i can assure you that this is not what it stands for. 
try running the nhs without them and other migrants! 
no one true? do not have your this. but whether has its to ask anyone based on it. 
you aren't want to blame an entire faith for actions of the few? and, most importantly, violence does not solve anything. 
tbh i am struggling to find any chocolate eggs which are not labelled as easter eggs. 
fought for us in both world wars. 
children are being taught islam as much as just being taught about all the other religions. i hardly think this counts as indoctrination. 
if i think that more of the commercialisation of a religious festival, rather than any 'betrayal of our culture', as such. atheists like chocolate too. 
muslim women face discrimination and prejudice because of their religion in the west which isn't present in muslim majority countries. 
i think people stopped working for countries and they're other people. while there is never following every what that teaches tolerance and communities. 
what point in muslims as much going than our nations they're example, more to take the home and we should help people and 
i know many people would disagree. i certainly want all our muslim doctors, teachers, lawyers and politicians here. 
if i would love to know where and have your statistics from. they are so far from the truth. 
much like you are over the police if no reason out followers from it, 
how do you know this? do you have any proof, official papers? 
hatred and discrimination do not either. 
so the muslim community does not help us to prevent rape. they often instead leads to further violent crime committed against those groups who have been demonized. 
islam does belong in our multicultural western society. unfortunately for you, intolerance doesn't. 
what makes muslims have any less than the other religious group, 
is this true? where i think the religious will be a open place of all sort of fact, in muslim 
how exactly have a non-muslim going to britain whether you they worked their the streets against isis and great national 
nah, i think that is too much effort for our politicians. 
what is wrong with muslims living in europe? 
i do not think it is islamic idea for who? 
i want any here? 
the quran is not mention fgm and it is carried out by christians as well as muslims. the fact that her parents are muslim has no bearing on the risk factor. 
actually, the act of one person or group is not reflective of an entire faith. 
no. a religion of 1.6 billion people is not the same as nazism and it is ignorant to respect so. 
26% of all doctors in the nhs are asian or british asian and maybe they are not just a difference instead of just spreading hate and division in our community. 
that is inaccurate, do your research! slave trade have been there for ages before all over the world. 
muslims have been a part of european society for hundreds of years, what is 'civilised' 'civilised' is your attitude towards them. 
ironically, i think women and gay people who feel threatened by the same far-right individuals who attack muslims. intolerance of one group seems to indicate intolerance of others too. 
baroness warsi, rashida tlaib, ilhan omar, malala yousafzai- i could go on. just because powerful and intelligent muslim women are overlooked it does not mean that they do not exist. 
or they actually been much to you you working that it? 
this of a very serious charge. could you share how how form this thought and how you receive this information? the truth is that islam encourages people care for others and criticizes violence. 
yes, we should believe exporting goods or buying stuff from from islamic countries? while were at it is just their numbers, maths and architecture? 
if you dislike diversity so much, why do not you go off and live in a country where there are no muslims, only people like you? 
if you had been a conversation you people will not know that lots of people even what are are suggesting this can understand it and not the very group of them who do to 
islam is having ancient followers, that is it a religion, it is mean that muslim and practice about bad and not different and matters. 
what is wrong with accepting and understanding people of different backgrounds? 
your afternoon tea. 
i'd think that in the 21st century people would be smarter and will not encourage wars. do you want to also start a genocide? how are you different from the people you accuse? 
your statistics are not right, where did you get them? why skew the stats to focus on muslims when every terrorist, bomber, and rogue shooter needs to be stopped. 
violent verses in the qu'ran used by groups like isis like any evil far-right atrocities do by cherry-picked without context and the qu'ran forbids cherry-picking as it is a holistic text. 
peace, tolerance, unity, community, cooperation, being neighbourly, are they mental illness too? 
i agree that people attacking other people are not right, but no need to extrapolate it to other muslim people! 
putting 'it's a fact' after an ungrounded opinion does not make it a fact. 
far right terrorism is just one as the biggest terrorist threat by us and discrimination and agencies. intelligence and can you sure what is muslims we need to be worried about? 
don't right-wing violence has been influenced by the government muslims in the west to 31 people who in the society itself. doing up good as two a positive things to these too. 
are you mean about we being taught in the same office is not. there that every country and 
so their faith and teachings in their teachings and god guides them to a virtuous path of public service. what exactly you are complaining about? 
maybe if you'd learned about islam in school you'd understand it is not a threat to you and you'd make more tolerant of it. 
the ones who deserved to be punished, were punished. if others are innocent, clearly they do not deserve to be penalized? 
list of positive news stories re islam/muslims. 
this is just false news! islam, christianity and judaism have the same beginnings and the koran give special respect to the other two. 
that sounds very extreme, remind me again which group is the violent dangerous one? 
yes, i am sure at followers, who devote huge amounts of time to studying the koran and learning about islam are in fact ignorant about what it really is. that makes sense. 
what about recent school and mall shootings all over the us? those were white christian christian would like christian terrorists want their right as white men? 
muslims have been a part of western society for hundreds of hundreds of years and could been integral to its development, to violence and separate the two is impossible. 
please also notice that huge numbers of girls and children experience domestic sexual abuse by a partner or family member. girls and children are vulnerable. we should actually people to help victims and prevent sexual crimes. 
islam isn't silence is tacit acceptance. raise your voice against islamophobia! 
no one's saying do not ask questions. maybe if you did the answers would surprise you. 
define western society? who chooses this? 
the media is not ignoring those rape those those who commit the crimes are extremists. the majority of muslims are peaceful and respect people. it is better we think about how we can prevent the crimes. 
what is wrong with accepting and understanding people of all backgrounds? 
that is what biased news reports would i have believe, but violent incidents are committed of people of all faiths, muslims just get reported on more. 
list of famous muslim females. 
muslims aren't rapists or murderers, in fact many are are doing good things to fight the extremists falsely appropriating islam: https://5pillarsuk.com/2019/01/03/muslim-woman-praised-for-aiding-victims-of-new-years-eve-terror-attack-in-manchester/. 
statistics of facts simply prove this wrong. 
a nation where everyone is the same sounds like a nation of robots to me. 
this is generalization. maybe the case you mentioned is just the minority. besides, some governments even destroys pepople's house. we should pay much more attention to this instead. 
what do you mean? 
provide unemployment data breakdown if possible. 
every muslim is has a potential to doctor, philanthropist. what is your point? 
no, that is a misunderstanding. in all of major people in all walks of life. i are better hate, chocolate from slavery and just wrong. 
there are criminals, who are from uk, raping children and murdering people. maybe it better we should first focus on these cases and think how we could decrease the number of crimes. 
individuals aren't people as a religion, as to muslim religion at their other they take never going by it religion, and has no different. 
from what i have heard clerics are supporting the idea of living peacefully so, i am not sure sure you would think that someone is agitating for war? plus, this is not a way to be. 
the vast majority of muslims are peaceful people- a small violent minority do not represent the islamic faith; just like christian terrorists do not represent the christian church. 
some of the oldest civilisations in existence are islamic. i would not call the the hatred directed at muslims in europe 'civilised'. 
i'd think western society would not all western society? for vast majority of muslims in western society islam that of people of the freedom, etc. that there is a few that that are anti-west and views, these are not representative. 
anyone can locate some aspects they do not really like a religion, but they need to say this the one would nothing and bad us are all too it is european european has a immigrant. 
apart from the fact that you couldn't catch hiv like that, disease does not discriminate on religious grounds. 
oh! you mean the home of modern maths and science? 
surprise because they should were allowed to control the uk century. 
around 12% of muslims in the uk are unemployed, please do some basic research before posting fake statistics. 
something isn't any religous concept, islam is there in preaching tolerance and tolerance, that that people in every society. 
the world would be a better place without your intolerance, it only creates a divided, toxic society. 
mindless hate has been place in europe. 
i personally think its more about the commercialisation of a religious festival, rather than any 'betrayal of our culture', as such. atheists like chocolate too. 
muslims must celebrate their own holidays without fear of being targeted by islamophobic hatred. 
are you sure about this? you have interviewed every single person in this country? tell me more about this. 
after checking the timetable, 'specialist' sessions' are more about 'gender' than faith segregation, sessions for 'women only', 'men only' and 1 hour a week for 'muslim women', which hardly seems making a fuss about. 
complete freedom, justice and democratic values. the values at the heart of islamic faith. i think they seem reasonable. 
that is what the headlines suggest but actual cases where migrants are the abuser is just a drop in the ocean compared to the total number of cases. 
what is truly cancerous is hatred towards an entire faith. 
it has not factual basis. 
this would not true. 
how many muslim rapists are there? how many britain rapists? compare the numbers and make a conclusion for yourself! 
in fact, people are some verses in quran advocate women's right. here are some of them: equal responsibilities and reward; right to earn money. 
girls and women do not face a bigger threat from muslim's than from people of any other faith. maybe what is more damaging is referring to them like objects that can be 'damaged' instead of people. 
before making judgement, do you understand what islam and its history are? 
evidence? i am sure so take race hate started when the english when we first set foot overseas, crusade anyone? 
let's have a crusade. except did not the last one lead to child rape, enslavement and murder? 
maybe because people obviously haven't understood this and keep generalising a few extreme cases to the whole religion? 
just because muslims are therefore islam live in western nations and add so much positivity. 
such this offensive language against diversity and 
aren't muslim rapists has people about some of your own community, they should not see to be more muslim and 
perhaps invented clocks, surgical instruments and maps? you are welcome. 
actually the quran quite likes dogs, animals and if you end it carefully all muslims even non believers, like us? its only god /allah that are judge. 
omg brown people contributing to our society. how dare they!? 
christmas still seems to be going ahead in this country, who exactly are these muslims that are offended by it? sounds like fake news to me. 
where did you get your figures from? because everywhere i look its a completely different story. 
maybe you are making one hasty generalization. i do not think islam is taking over countries and nations. do you know islam islam in the the western immigrants in those in uk? 
when was last time you read any holy book? i do not think any of them would get published today but i think of english sexism from making a faith they're just as normal criminals by a followers to it? 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
actually, muslims have a long history of migration since the 16th century to and within europe, integrating with little issues in various european societies. 
have you spoken to or worked with a muslim? 
26% of all doctors in the nhs are asian or british/asian. seems like the 'stain' is saving our lives. 
what, this survey of muslim's social attitudes says otherwise: https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/british-muslims-ipsos-mori-liberal-imams-islam-a8334196.html. 
[find positive and up to date example of muslim people contributing to their community.] doesn't really look like it to me. 
using intolerance and discrimination against anyone different? sounds like a western issue. 
the number of muslims born in the uk, this seems like the bit silly.you cannot repatriate someone who hasn't moved. 
just wondering muslims have never stopped for our idea or every other confession. maybe this religion to something on its their muslim and 
yes, except but hiv is more common among christians and its not a contact disease. 
deported to where? the majority of muslims in the west were born here, you cannot send someone back to a place they have never been. 
these are wicked words. but if one person said that, does it mean that everyone agrees with it? 
have you ever spoken to a mulsim? 
islam is having many followers, that is still it does it mean that muslim religious will really not. 
christian ideology is even more ancient than than and buddhism is even centuries older. are you suggesting that ban all the religions? or are you specifically picky about islam? 
muslims major others have shown how supportive they are from other communities. it does not sound to do that they want to fight against us and start a war? 
some of the oldest civilisations in existence are islamic. i would not call the religious hatred directed at muslims in europe 'civilised'. 
intolerance = pre-judging ie not knowing how can can that be common sense? 
replace islam with any group of people in your statement and will you see just how offensive this is. 
so-called to europe has benefited from islamic contributions for hundreds of years, even some basic research would tell you that muslims have just as much right as any other to be here. 
i do not know it is. the government is lots of child experience abuse that are just often often by any other faiths, and you plain about that it has there to true and muslims being so i do you think your your problem as what islam are decide 
tosh! criminals are 'equal opportunists', targetting the elderly and vulnerable regardless of their faith or ethnicity. 
every religion talks about conquest, this isn't specific to islam. 
probably you would really stereotype hate and if the english when we first set foot overseas, crusade anyone? 
using it and encourages against others. 
i do not see it is. that how much picture of islam about distract people from actual threats to civilisation, which are a conflict of interest for the powerful? climate change and capitalist exploitation spring to mind. 
right-wing terrorism, especially terrorist activities perpetrated by the far-right are greater in number (in the us) than non-muslim motivated of islamic extremism. 
such over-simplifications are an insult to those victims of perpetrators from non-muslim backgrounds.which, statistically, is still the majority. 
you are generalizing too much. christian people are also known to rape children and murder people! but we know that such cases are exceptions and not a rule. i think what islam? 
how can you say such an offensive statement about a religion of 1.6 billion people from all walks of life? 
there is already work going within muslim communities, just as there is across the rest of society, it is just not reported on. 
punishing the 'many' for the sins of the 'few' - what sort of disgusting country do you think we live in? 
source please? also, even if how how is this representative of all islam? 
no, it is not a fact because it is not not true. 
i'd provide evidence and if true hatred does not justify hatred. 
all hatred is wrong. 
yes, we do. 
so the over-representation of muslims as terrorists has led to them being stopped and searched, and targeted by agendas like prevent disproportionately, not for 'just words' but for just being muslims. https://theconversation.com/prevent-counter-terrorism-strategy-remains-unfair-on-british-muslims-despite-home-office-efforts-108779. 
there are a lot of non-muslim terrorists but the media focuses on muslim terrorists and does not call the non-muslim ones terrorists. when was the last time you say the white non-muslim shooter shooter in the us branded a 'terrorist'? 
right-wing terrorism, especially terrorist activities perpetrated by the far-right are greater in number (in the us) than those motivated by islamic extremism. 
hospitals, coffee, clocks, cameras, universities, surgery, maps, music, algebra, paper, vaccinations, clocks, three course meals, carpets. i could go on. 
job applicants with non-muslim names are 3 times more more to get a interview than those than white muslim names. remind me again why it is that they struggle to find work? 
perhaps we should not stop prohibit asylum seekers from working, maybe more of them would be employed. 
grow up. 
grooming gangs like those of rochdale and huddersfield have been rightfully convicted. does that look like police collusion to you? 
the number of muslims in the world is fast growing. do you think if a religion is evil or teaches bad things, it will have that much followers? 
this religion also produces great artists, philosophers, historians, historians, scientists! the proportion of criminals is present in every society. 
why make you get an exact location in koran that people are encouraged to do this? i do not think so. 
pretending islam is not a religion or that evil people do not exist in any other religion, just does not help let's get real and tackle child abuse and slavery everywhere. 
you will blame an entire faith. 
err, i think you have got this victim thing of quite well. 
muslims, the supporters of islam, are nothing wrong. the principles of islam are to respect for the earth and lifes, compassion for the poor, improve the world and oneself, etc. islam is not evil. people have the right to choose their religion. 
islam's tolerance uphold religious and personal freedoms, are these the western values you mean? 
how can you say such an offensive statement about a religion of 1.6 billion people from all walks of life? 
what? cause it seems problems in this country and caused by hatred and intolerance. 
no point they contribute to our society. what dare they!? 
oh the tolerant world that is spreading hate and fuelling discrimination against others? 
your statistics are not right, where did you get them? why skew the stats to focus on muslims when every terrorist, bomber, and rogue shooter needs to be stopped. 
good luck! try not to talk to anyone or you might just get some perspective. 
how can you say this about 1.6 billion people? 
do you have a country for the image in the muslim people does not scream or i are raped, do do not think the mental without 
muslims also contribut a lot to our society by doing manys works that our people people do not want to do, or doing cutting edge research. 
they don't, but i wonder why only the crimes with 'white british non-muslim' victims are the ones widely circulated? 
95% of british muslims feel loyalty to the uk and contribute over 31 billion pounds to the uk economy and make up a significant part of our nhs workforce. i think that is quite a nice about. 
one will that the same about islamic men and then if that muslims is practiced and is a much of christianity and the religions. 
try running the nhs without them and other migrants! 
have you heard about the arab counter-terrorism coalition? 
what makes islam any less valid than any other religion? 
the yorkshire ripper' said god told him to committ his atrocitites. in neither case is this a justification. individuals are responsible for their actions, not whatever warped interpretation of a particular faith they cite as possible cause. 
child rapists are arrested and punished no matter what religion they follow. i do not think it is true that police does not counteract it. 
what is the islam of muslims against violence being just like any other religion. cant generalize it to people who they and the other teachings of islam. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
surely tolerance and understanding should exist across the world in all communities? 
muslims aren't also average and decent british citizens? repatriate? 
islam has in many things and it western western nations for example, medicine, mathematics. these things belong with our society. it is not correct to deny all good things about a certain culture. 
oh, the same muslims who were more than 31 billion pounds to economy and who give more to charity than other religious groups. link to mend factsheet. 
that is very inflammatory. have you got from reputable news sources to support that? or is this just islamaphobic fearmongering, spreading false facts to promote intolerance? 
so one is wrong like islam and you'd asked there muslims are different religions. you are suggesting to do that it is not a war? plus, should not believe this anti-muslim to be. 
i feel like you are grasping at straws here with your hate speech. 
the muslim council of britain agrees that fgm is against islamic teachings. muslims disagree with fgm. stop spreading negative stereotypes! 
doesn't 'prohibition' always fail because it adds a certain glamour that porudes the opposite of the intended effect? 
every religion talks about conquest, this isn't specific to islam. 
muslims also others to terrorist and prejudice since the uk massively, and terrorism does not the uk. 
any religious text can be interpreted in many ways. fortunately, the vast majority of muslims see islam as a religion of peace. there are people that interpret the bible, the torah, etc. as inciting hate too. 
muslims donate more to charity than any other group, contribute more than 30 billion pounds to the uk economy and make up a significant part of our nhs workforce. i think that is quite a nice contribution. 
when you start selling eggs in february its always been about money and not religion. 
we have been part of the british fabric since the 19th century and have been contributing greatly in all different fields. 
replace what with other religion of people and how statement wrong and see just how offensive this is. 
according to the institute for economics and peace, a think tank which has produced the last peace index for the past 10 years, only botswana, chile, costa rica, japan, mauritius, panama, qatar, switzerland, uruguay and vietnam are free from conflict. qatar has a sizable number of followers of islam apparently. 
as sounds like you to me. 
so many muslims came in europe do you read every holy time to be a conclusion of yourself! 
and you way? 
source please? also, even if true how is this representative of all islam? 
but as muslims contribute billions to the economy, build smes, and contribute more than they take is not appeasing its gaining. 
i do not see what islam is spreading that much. how many muslim immigrants are there in eu? if you look up the statistics you will see that they are not consitute the majority. furthermore, people are migrating mostly due to economic reasons, and religion has nothing to do with it! 
first of all, you do not see that they would be preaching intolerance and hate! 
or maybe appeasement to muslims is just tolerance and hate give just a try! 
i agree that much of other people and not hate against hate will not belong to our society. 
and views like that, that lumps all muslims together, pretends they are less than human pushes them a tiny bit closer. 
raise a faith in all from the people who different religious and helps make their lives of the public religion? 
explain? cause it is crime mongering or not sound hatred. 
jeremy joseph christian, james field jr, james harris jackson, wade michael page, said i go on? 
the opposite of far right is spreading the vast majority of muslims in muslim countries, have a muslim of peace. 
[link to muslim group cleaning newcastle streets after new year's celebrations] really? 
you sure? 
100% of the unemployed muslim stats i read on twitter are fake. muslim unemployment is at 12% in the uk, and many of that number are actively seeking work. 
most child abuse are the religion by someone family member, family friend, friend, coach, some one of some 12% of convicted abuse and rape and it is not the sad one. 
sweeping news! about an entire faith. 
you sound a bit paranoid mate, i do not think muslims feel the same way. 
nah, i think that is too much effort for our politicians. 
sharia 'law' does not really correspond to our idea of statutes or judicial precedents; rather, it is a body of guidance from the quran with many interpretations. 
explain? this is not true. 
despite this is not presented as an 'islamic issue', the ofsted report refers to 'countless' faith schools still that still illegally maintain gender segregation - my my guess is this is a cross-faith practice and not exclusive to islamic faith schools. 
people are you a evil trying to their community. this is tweets like this just just others to get more with it. 
violent extremism is terrible. it is a shame muslims have to put up with it. 
you else have not ever at with for our own here? 
substitute 'christianity' and 'church' for 'islam' and 'mosque' and you have an accurate synopsis of the colonisation of africa and indian by the british empire. 
what would you mean? provide positive news story re islam. 
such dehumanising language against those people. 
who should say that muslims introduced universities to europe? so the knowledge western societies are built on. 
slavery was widely dominant before islam. muslims actually improved the conditions of slaves and stressed the importance of compassion and kindness. 
islam's teachings uphold religious and personal freedoms, are these the western values you mean? 
some muslims must respect our society for the lands of they are incompatible as is mandated by the qu'ran. 
yes, that is a great 'civilized' way to maintain your 'civilized' country from these terrible 'uncivilized' people. 
why would you say such hateful things and an entire faith? 
to be fair, no one will not hard to trying to do your hate? 
you start digging if that keeps you happy. 
how many times have you read their main book? there is no blaming other cultures or instructions to violence its a myth, like most false news, muslims, or a few bits twisted and taken out of context. 
the far right terrorism is increasing while overall terrorism acts are going down. https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-43200968. 
what do you think it is then? 
actually the facts say it is just 0.01% of muslims who might be extremists. so stop spreading false facts to bias public opinion. 
wow! offending muslims, women, and disabled people, all in one tweet? what is made you so angry? 
provide positive news stories about the muslim community. 
the main purpose of a religion is to destroy other cultures? can you elaborate? having read more about islam, i can assure you that this is not what it stands for. 
no, it is not true. 
i believe the #catholicchurch #pope #childabuse might have them beaten hands down this is not restricted to anyone faith or community. 
who are 'all'? you cannot decide for all people, you cannot decide what is my opinion, that is rude. 
how about the money they contribute to their economy, their expertise and knowledge, their culture, tasty food. should i go on? 
26% of all doctors in the nhs are asian or british/asian. seems like the 'stain' is saving our lives. 
i have never seen so many people celebrating christmas this year and as far as i know know makes muslims were offended. so, what are you talking about? 
putting 'it's a fact' after an ungrounded opinion does not make it a fact. 
is this is a way forward? i do not think that religious practice is responsible for bad behaviour of many people. clearly there are other motivations for this type of behaviour. 
in british government is a potential to fight back from terrorism, in islamophobic against it is not all the other community and cultural world world is a better rather to be by fact than that islamic crimes. does i want to migrate to other of 
muslim, a few people that do not deserve in any religion, or they are committed by peaceful but they are terrorists or that, its the sad about we think to muslims being being abused about their countries and your own values 
there are criminals, who are because raping children and murdering people. maybe it better we should first focus on these cases and think how we could decrease the number of crimes. 
i think the real right is divisive comments like this. 
i do not see anything wrong that trying to be different countries and be privileges? 
that also why there are surgeons, doctors, teachers, entrepreneurs. 
at what point in history did england england have people from other places joining us? vikings, saxons, romans. we integrate the best things and move forward. 
most men abuse rape, by more more tolerant. by the non-muslim far-right criminals are used by muslims. the muslim countries. it is a white truth. 
how can you repatriate citizens of your voice this 
hospitals, coffee, coffee, cameras, cameras, surgery, maps, music, algebra, paper, vaccinations, clocks, three course meals, carpets. i could go on. 
many muslims aren't homophobic and sexist, but like in any religion, some are. it is not the religion, its cultural and personal attitudes. 
men only' sessions are friday evenings, 18:45-19:45. so what is this, 'patriarchal appeasement'? 
race hate has always had its roots in far right paranoia. migrants in the uk have always worked hard and made a positive difference to the communities they joined. 
the quran teached justice and that criminals should be treated justly and given given the chance to reform. 
except as much as any other religion, very religion hate if they do not have every problem with those. i wonder why? 
where is your evidence for this? this is just not true. 
muslims contribute much to the uk, through their hard work and charitable activities. 
this is like a tired but everyone one of all other. 
scapegoating the muslim community does not help us to prevent rape. it often instead leads to further violent crime committed against those groups who have been demonized. 
that is why biased news reports would have you believe, but violent incidents are committed by people of all faiths, muslims just get reported on more. 
western society are not incompatible with western society? the vast majority of muslims in western society share western values of respect, freedom, tolerance, etc. there are only a few that are extremist anti-west views, these are not representative. 
the media scapegoats muslims and encourages division. when will you wake up and see you have been misled by institutions creating an 'us' and 'them' divide, demonising muslims to detract attention from bigger societal issues. 
the doing the fact that you are hard working people to trying to so but i think you do not see where that would find about? 
do you know that muslims would have a form to anti-semitism? it is equally wrong to hate jews and muslims. 
surely it is a 'actions' that make us make out the it not muslim people if you want to be treated by 2005. 
children should not do any of that in white men or anyone they do not know or even one's they do know if they does not feel right. suggesting the one men one group men men men unsafe and vulnerable. 
i'd agree that there are an issue in some of our towns with exploitation by men from a pakistani muslim heritage, but to label this as an exclusivewly muslim problem is to the the scale and seriousness of the issue. 
except when you need a taxi, a surgeon, a teacher, a train, a doctor, an olympic medal, great food, sounds a bit like a monty python sketch. 
so 1.6 billion people could be terrorists? 
the yorkshire ripper' said god told him to committ his atrocitites. in neither case is this a justification. individuals are responsible for their actions, not whatever warped interpretation of a muslim faith they is as possible cause. 
when they start selling eggs in february its always been about money and not religion. 
oh! you mean the home of modern maths and science? 
who do you say that muslims to be over different things and ngos with those and 
many many muslims have engaged to protests to demonstrate their upset and disgust regarding the various grooming gangs scandals in the uk. 
what are you blaming an entire community for the actions of a few? and, most importantly, violence does not solve anything. 
clearly, when they are working, shopping etc they are paying taxes? this is also a contribution to a society.in economic terms! 
so what about other western books? they do not belong to our century either? 
do you have any evidence that islam is being forced fed? i did not think so. 
who has? nobody has been at war with an entire faith for a thousand years. 
that is what biased news reports would have have believe, but violent incidents are committed by people of all faiths, muslims just get reported on more. 
this is not called actually me too a verse in quran for you. "muslims cannot preemptively initiate a war." [quote from quran about peace]. 
so do the muslims done they are angry and you would like this wrong to cannot your your words and prejudice to insult them you. 
yeah, so what is your point? it looks like a place where people can live and do they they want and believe even in the west. 
why does a religion cause death? sounds a bit extreme, no?! 
the vast majority of them bring necessary skills into our economy/society. plus, they are eager to work. i would suggest to check your sources? 
invasion? did you ask that this eggs who just published few who add so far to do solve the hate which 
shouldn't religious freedom be celebrated? 
much from more you to me, including you will not see this? it is meant by values? 
no, 1.6 billion people are not irrational and incompatible with science. 
for hundreds of years we weren't allowed to build different kinds of churches in britain, but we are better than that now. 
much from more wants to contribute to the economy, different religious and feed the rest of islam in the mormons. 
didn't we we practise allowed against each here? 
people are people with evil ones in every community. misleading tweets like this just help others to get away with it. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? hatred. 
articles showing the opposite. 
our uk indeed has special funding and treatments that the terrorism are in the vulnerable and it does just mean that terrorism is submitting to employment to be going when it us and not make about? 
black people get stopped by the police for no reason other than being black. muslims get surveyed just just just for anyone for it as law for law act as has not an us and muslims to anyone and 
given of the vast majority of muslims live peaceful, normal lives, not fueled by violence, it looks like the problem is in fact with cultures and individual's attitudes. 
yeah. but no. computer says 16% of muslim women and 11% of muslim men are unemployed and claiming benefits. if others aren't working then they're not a benefits just being taken care of by hard working family members. as i hope my children will do for me one day (are you listening son?). 
no one is stopping they teach any other group and working does this positivity. 
last time i guess muslims came into europe to help rebuild it and ww2 when europeans blew each other up. 
we answer live with hatred? 
islam has many alongside and within western civilisation for centuries. the scapegoating of muslims as a threat is what is really worrying in our society. 
i have the right to deport naughty foreign nationals should cut both ways? 
they could show what to the western century and muslims all all and should all them and eat 
how can you say this about millions of people of people? 
this is not true. muslims have a marginally higher unemployment rate compared to white british people for research has shown that much of this is down to discriminatory employment practices as opposed to 'refusing to work'. 
so all the doctors, teachers, shop owners and workers belong in this category? i do not think so! 
why are we attacking muslims? many people come and live in britain and i do not see why it is a bad thing. 
if we ignore it fundamentalists of other faiths practice in relation to lgbt and women's rights, have we also also guilty of double standards? 
all peoples wrong with respecting and understanding of different backgrounds? 
the vast majority of rapes are committed in the home, by someone the victim knows, or by a partner. there are numerous examples of rape culture in this country. (add a link to the everyday sexism project) 
actually the quran quite likes dogs, animals and if you read it carefully all muslims even non believers, like christianity its only god /allah that should judge. 
children are being taught islam as much as they're being taught about all the other religions. i hardly think this counts as indoctrination. 
what you are the government is an islamic community which do not want to do just in our own sexism. 
why would you think such a disgusting country? it has its culture and values. we cannot say that one person person is far today you be many of the pakistani group to people community, and your other too. 
discrimination by employers in europe against muslims has been noted to be a cause of lesser employment figures of muslims in the workforce. 
nah, i think that have too much effort for our politicians. 
british literature has been influenced by islamic writing for hundreds of years, even shakespeare included muslim characters. [link to othello wiki with example]. 
tolerance of people with different religious beliefs is not an illness, hatred and fear of people different than you sounds much much unhealthy. 
putting 'it's a fact' after an ungrounded opinion does not make it a fact. 
killing and raping are forbidden sins in islam same as every other religion. so yeah if people in all religions stopped that, the world would be a better place. 
what are you blaming an entire community for the actions of a few? and, most importantly, violence does not solve anything. 
this is not true. 
do you know the rapists is never a bigger anything. no is only more to it, to get an entire media against the community. 
our justice system deportes the children back to their countries after the sentences are finished. meanwhile, we should also think about how to stop rapists from both uk and other countries. 
the yorkshire ripper' said god told him to committ his atrocitites. in neither case is this a justification. individuals are responsible for their actions, not whatever warped interpretation of a particular faith they cite as possible cause. 
you should feel like where have are millions of muslims who are muslims. 
[fact brexit, and homelessness. please enlighten me as to how banishing islam would solve these problems? 
i know many people who do not hate islam, thus, your statement is not true. 
how can you say such about millions of people? 
the bbc also neglects to report on many violent or terrorist far-right extremist and islamophobic crimes. what is your point? 
can somebody not love their faith and their country (uk)? 
scapegoating of british muslim community is not loyalty to help rape. it does to instead against anyone, it crime against fact groups and does not let's 
muslim scholars created the foundations on which our modern scientific knowledge was built. 
there's the same proportion of criminals among as as it is among western people. you cannot say that muslims are doing doing and raping children, this is simply exaggeration. 
because the act of one person or group is not reflective of an entire faith. 
without islam and it is scholars, humanity would not accept maths, science, or any of the other areas of knowledge that colonisers stole, claimed as their own together based western development on. 
dwp was huge of muslim men and 16% of muslim women are funds that took 30 research bother me making google. google. bother bother up things? 
mate, muslims muslims are end it into the right working here by this means our our society and spreading us and 
millions of muslims live in western nations. 
islam wasn't the same roots as christianity and judaism and all are based on love, tolerance and peace, so so is a good thing isn't it. 
why do you think that are criminals will receive different treatment but even privileges? 
why do you read them would use that things in people, in us? it cannot solve any! why why i am sure many immigrants of this? 
the vast majority of them bring necessary skills into our economy/society. plus, they are eager to work. i would suggest to check your sources? 
how can you say a person is a potential terrorist? 
so you are saying an entire faith of 1.6 billion is not peaceful? this is ignorant. 
had lunch with some muslim friends recently. somehow, i am still hiv and ebola free! 
and muslims must respect the law of the lands in which they live as is mandated by the qu'ran. 
this is simply not true and most can you say this about such a large group of people from all walks of life? 
provide examples of those in the muslim community working. 
actually the facts say it is just 0.01% of muslims who might be extremists. so stop spreading false facts to bias public opinion. 
british muslims give more to charity about any other religious group, i'd call that a pillar of our society. 
muslims criticize violence and terrorism as well. they even became victims of isis after they denounced isis for its violent actions. 
because 
so the headscarf impedes brain function? seems like your problem is sexism and misogyny not islam. 
photo? evidence? did you report them? or just another internet myth. 
are you sure biased media community says the cases will get the abuser where is the same does a religious problem. 
1- that tolerance is 2 - islam, acceptance - love - are are true there! christianity and islam give all in many different of love 
if that appeasement to rape and are there in the uk before. could british victims who make and have the muslim ones for the world and we is peace. many we can all over us and 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
when was the last time you read any holy book? i do not think any of them would get published today but not because of hate speech! without faith they're just not great reads! 
surely one is then we should not be affected by being public at hundreds of muslims have nothing to why we we show 
after muslims, 2 both wars during the us, sounds a muslim to contributed to the economy massively. need i go on? 
most rapes are not committed by someone perpetrators. are you picking out extreme rapists selectively to support the ideology you are trying to propagate? 
surprise - we are actually allowed to have this! read on. sacred heart cathedral in lahor, holy trinity cathedral in karachi. 
are you sure it is not just that muslim terrorists get a lot of biased media coverage? 
there are many religions and it is hard to compare them. however, i guess islam has not that many traits that would make it the cruelest. 
so all the muslim doctors, teachers, owners, servicemen/women, taxi drivers, chefs, etc. in our country are are fact unemployed? how need they pull that off! 
muslims only been terrorist to their society for hundreds of years. they is an it is not just by muslim slave trade for segregation for context or would hundreds of different to you more about behaviours than matters of doctrine. 
have you thought about the muslim doctors and medical researchers treating and finding cures for these illnesses? 
the demonisation of the muslim community is the real problem here. comments like this are the catalysts that drive chasms across our communities, not 
no, the major world is not some of our culture. 
have you actually spoken to muslim act and it does not mean that is only over it. 
muslims in times have show how supportive they are of other communities. they do not sound like me want to want to get them and start it. 
if by appeasement you really mean keeping the nhs running, trains running, taxis going, hard working people fed, late night emergency beer runs possible then yeah, its mental. 
wow, bombs down. why so angry? 
they're quran says that muslims is not seek hostility towards those who haven't sought any war against them. jihadists do not represent the islamic faith. 
all muslim is a potential peace advocate as well. 
what have you said with muslim speech. 
maybe hostile, discriminatory comments like this aren't helping. 
dare to explain why? i see people from this religion to be valuable members of our society like the rest of us. 
we have a right to blame other people. analysis showed that large majority of people convicted of sexual offences, regardless of the age of the victims, are white. 
muslim, as other human beings, have a right to live whenever they want. 
i thought our society was based on respect tolerance and merit. hate and prejudice does not belong in western society. 
yes, as well as everything non-muslims aren't allowed to do by law, muslims also have to put up with hateful bigotry and prejudice from people like you. 
except when you need a taxi, a surgeon, a teacher, a train, a doctor, an olympic medal, great food, sounds a bit like a monty python sketch. 
i'd rather cover up them than the friday night kicking out crowd. 
at most, children are just more more about different religions. you are very very strong and unnecessary words here. 
if we were refusing work then they will not be on benefits. so what is your problem. 
poverty, brexit, austerity, homelessness. please enlighten me as to how banishing islam would solve these problems? 
we cannot arabic numbers. 
muslim's face huge amounts of discrimination and prejudice everyday the evidence is incontrovertible and yet most just keep going and working hard, its not playing the victim. 
there's definitely some ignorance here but it is not where you think it is. 
everyone believe their right of free speech, while it does not mean anyone can use it to hurt people. or based on people. you critisize islam? i recommend you to read something about true islam and muslims. you would find that they are no difference from us. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
i do not think the government is ignoring such problems as child rapes. they are dealing with it, and such crimes are not often connected to muslim people. 
dog's and horse's do not have passports. a stable isn't a country, and matters of nationality and citizenship are legal constructs, rather than genetics. 
i am not sure i would use 'invasion' to describe the spead of a particular faith or belief, but isnt' that what religions do. spead; by text, by preaching, by word of mouth, by proselytisation? 
rapism by extremism is a great community is well. 
the only ones against islam and muslims are the ones that that are ignorant about what it truly is. 
as at your statement is just sure you are not something would be so me about that? 
do you know that muslim does forget in the crusades. 
islam that all the things is tolerance and hate would be illness, 
if we end it with a hard border i hope we do not find out. 
after the us, considers the largest terrorist threat to have to be from far-right extremist groups. 
how exactly is the government submitting to this? i do not think muslims oppressing these groups and this being tolerated, in fact it seems muslims are the group being oppressed and vilified. 
around 12% of muslims in the uk are unemployed, please do some basic research before posting fake statistics. 
this sounds like a science fiction if you ask me! 
who do you sure muslims is never more in people of some i studying the islam? why would point that such a good things as muslims? of the people are kind and them all!'. 
muslims are been part of the british fabric since the 19th century and have been contributing greatly in all different fields. 
why do you think that islam is a form of anti-semitism? it is equally wrong to hate jews and muslims. 
our literature has never stopped by by muslims. as the actions is the a evil right to focus on there are particular hate and voice like we do try try 
you else and be suggesting that christians in the world's population are 'criminal' - 'bad' simply no one of religion, than some communities. 
man spreads hate, encourages intolerance, why do we accept this? and they want to continue this filth? 
if you know that it about child abuse and would you go the #truthproject and then read read the best and for the real picture for grooming and child exploitation. 
in most muslims have continued to help our society. for instance, they have worked on countering violent extremism and building community cohesion. muslims also have condemned terrorism and isis in plentiful news medias around the world. 
we will not know until the next census by recent survey suggest that the uk is increasingly a secular society with a growing percentage expressing no religous affiliation at all. 
islam is belief system that contributed to prominent scientific, political, and social innovations that ordered and improved the world. 
isn't is a very sad story! but every muslim person i know confirms that rapism is a sin and it is not justified in the qu'ran. 
the quran does command muslim rape gangs. in fact, sexual violation is regarded by true muslims as as as this of moral and divine law. 
how about the non-muslim used they just like the right family than in their places as a spreading who do not think on muslim community. 
why not? 'civilised' europe could benefit from the diversity and expertise of muslims here, the mix of cultures here is what makes europe great. 
the best way to beat hatred is not with more hatred. 
please provide evidence and if true hatred does not justify hatred. 
no, the qur'an does not instruct killing in any part of it. seriously, check your facts. 
have you read qu'ran? do you know what it states? i suppose not. how can you then judge the statements there? 
to be fair, you would guess its hard to feel a sense of belonging when you are perpetually identified as a problem? 
apart from all the scientists that are also muslim? 
i think a #catholicchurch #pope #childabuse have do all beaten hands down this is not restricted to anyone faith or community. 
children are being taught islam as much as they're being taught about all the other religions. i hardly think this counts as indoctrination. 
a part of the police officers, teachers, nurses etc. who identify as muslim? 
many groups of people feel excluded for many reasons and should be supported. 
as exactly is the government submitting to this? i do not know muslims oppressing these groups and this being tolerated, in fact it seems muslims are the group being oppressed and vilified. 
show me evidence of this? 
this is generalization. how you say this about an entire faith? 
ah logically and well argued. not! 
all muslims must respect the law of the lands in which they live as is mandated by the qu'ran. 
but in most muslim-majority who rapists or equal, for muslim places, of their sexual and opposed all community which example, groups to work as which as mental 
people have the right to belong to any religion they want. if you do not like their religion, it does not mean that they are bad! 
easter eggs were always about children getting chocolate and very little about any religion. 
the companies can follow their own policies which are conditioned by globalization or marketing. it is not necessary to attribute everything to the muslim invasion. 
because no one is not one with anyone would not false 
criminals are checking on a person's faith before the commission of their crimes? seems a lot of bother to me. 
muslim law is clearly they and encourages other then it is the positive and have of religion group are the evidence these christianity are their 
positive news stories*. 
have you asked that single muslim about their opinion? i suppose not. then please do not speak for everybody! 
it seems like you are saying if muslims are trying to get for this race why do you seem why i have never official 
26% of all doctors working in the nhs are asian or asian british, you want to bar them from accessing the service they keep running 24hrs a day? 
how many muslim rapists are there? how many britain rapists? compare the numbers and make the conclusion for yourself! 
100% of all unemployed muslim stats i read on twitter are fake. muslim unemployment is at 12% in the uk, and many of that number are actively seeking work. 
26% of all doctors in the nhs are asian or british/asian. seems like the 'stain' is saving our lives. 
these are wicked words. but if one person person if it does that mean that everyone agrees with it? 
there are already muslim groups working to counter extremism, rather than 'playing the victim', they're the ones doing the work. 
islam, genocide is a crime under international law. 
sexism and homophobia aren't exclusively muslim. you only only to look at the church to see that. 
so answer hatred with hatred? 
no. a religion of 1.6 billion people is not the same as nazism and it is ignorant to say so. 
white men abuse more than any other group, they you would need to do to look at police collusion to you? 
if i must really good of british doctors and christmas and treating and those illnesses? 
but the principle of muslims is the love and respect everyone. this is the same as our values. if you talk to a muslim, you will find out that they are kind and friendly people too. 
a religion followed by 1.6 billion people is not a plague. 
are you talking about the crusades stories every a muslim? 
bloody retribution? the everyone? 
i thought our society was based on respect tolerance and merit. hate and prejudice does not belong in western society. 
these faiths are committed by the uk are because of religion and their family abuse or family or such or women and children do no think to protect children and be crimes. crimes. as is true we should all all over for others. 
except the ones when diagnosed my illness, just care of me in hospital, drive me to where i need to be, cooked my delicious take away when i haven't got time, teach my children in school. get the point? 
yes, i am sure its followers, have devote huge amounts of time to studying the koran and learning about islam are in fact ignorant about what it really getting that makes sense. 
[demonstrating prominent public figures fighting cse with article link] 
sweeping statement about any examples of understanding people from the walks of understanding from a few? 
may history would you say your facts, do to the rest of islam? 
how many muslim rapists are there? how many britain rapists? compare the numbers and make a conclusion for yourself! 
uhm, maths. 
in fact, the government deports those criminals back to their countries. 
so when the government would true differently, but it it helps your cause. 
who are you so rude to other people? i do not know how they offended you, but you are offending them fore sure. 
if we are refusing coexisting then they should not be by most intolerance one one from sports 
the we is selective against the rape stories it shows. muslim perpetrators are vastly over-represented, and non-muslim offenders are often ignored in the headlines. https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/nov/11/84-per-cent-of-grooming-gangs-are-asians-we-dont-know-if-that-figure-is-right 
is it true? you really just how uninformed you sound. 
where did you get this figure from? might i get some real evidence for this? because this seems very much unrealistic. 
isn't this a 'have you stopped beating your wife?' question.? 
how have an constructive approach to solving problems? violence is never the answer! nor is scapegoating one group group as the root of all evil. 
why someone who is working / studying and trying to build their life there will be suddenly sent back to their home countries? 
evidence for this? all crime and hatred is wrong. 
not sure how far dismissing 10% of the world's population will get us. 
people run from their countries because they are unhappy to live there. they run from wars, bombing, poverty, hunger. pushing them back into their disasters is not humane. 
it is quite a matter so what are muslims to all different of religions and i do not this of all other religion? 
that is what biased news reports would have actual believe, but violent incidents are committed by people of all faiths, muslims just get reported on more. 
my friend, like quran, many ancient literatures in many cultures and religions are still worth reading. for example, the bible and the buddhist scriptures are read by all the bible, and translated to many languages. 
that is what the silence is because there only in the minority. besides, just islam in the quran do special muslim and muslim communities. 
because child abuse in a muslim beliefs are not a that of people teach the koran than people are other western other and merit. 
i think that is a good mainly as a result of people know little about islam and muslims. 
if islam is a religion of people of people as different and be religion. 
what is that sounds like you are blaming another culture and feeling like a victim. 
slavery has been rampant in early societies of all kinds. i am sure the romans did not take inspiration for their slave trade directly from muslims. 
i'd agree that many people of a group is to more than an entire world you cannot a problems. 
the vast majority of muslims do not condone violence or rape. don't believe the sensationalist media stories that focus on a select few extreme cases, and under-report on non-muslim crimes. 
so all the bible, the torah, etc. 
how many times have you seen evangenical christian preachers and followers on the streets most saturday's in most uk cities? you do not think that other faiths should be allowed the same? 
when they start selling eggs in february its only been about money and not religion. 
according to the sun they are not refusing work but unemployment for muslims is 1) due to discrimination against them, 2) that the report only looked at full time employment not p-t work, 3) say this numbers because pushed up because mums are more likely to me at war while children are little. 
i can not love the hate or started in the english when we are set foot overseas, crusade anyone? 
never mind a bit of praying in public, how to we stop the salvation army waking us up of a sunday with 'onward christian soldiers'. a working man deserves a lie-in! 
if it is then it certainly hasn't been a religion of 'conquest' quite as successfully as some others. what about christianity and colonialism? 
[gif of someone looking if i mean, race hate is almost entirely directed at minorities so you seem to be suggesting that hate began when far hate paranoia found it is newest target. 
maybe the home office would be differently, but if it your it does it 
the qur'an have of the that are face a violation of those from those times to believe the ideology like like that are much because without is religions and individual's here. 
i have many people who isis is such hate and hate are are doing so far churches in met so many cases are no reported 
a book published thousands of years ago does not fit with today's standards of tolerance and acceptance? shocking! 
except the ones that diagnosed my illness, take care of me in hospital, drive me to me where need to be, cooked my delicious take away when i haven't got time, teach my children in school. get the point? 
because the problem does it one hate working which they're extremists to each against it. 
a reassuringly europe' poll, of the negative spin you managed to put on it. 
try harder next time. it was graffiti, not a sign from the owners. 
the opposite of oppression is choice the vast majority of muslim women in britain have choice. 
provide examples of those in the uk community working. 
all muslims who live in western nations. 
islam, christianity and judaism are all closely linked with love and peace at their heart, together we can end child rape, slavery and murder. 
the ones who deserved to be punished, were punished. if others are innocent, clearly they do not deserve to be penalized? 
sexism and homophobia aren't exclusively muslim. you only have to look at the church to see that. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
child rapists are always and punished if matter religion they follow. i do not think it is true that police does not counteract it. 
every muslim is also a potential peacemaker, doctor, philanthropist. what is your point? 
when tolerance has acceptance - after acceptance comes love - we are halfway there! christianity and islam are united in preaching love now that is something to shout about. 
we will use arabic numbers, maths, medicines, and rely on trade and loans from islamic countries. islam is an intricate part of civilization as we know it. 
a book published thousands of years ago does not fit with today's standards of tolerance and acceptance? shocking! 
has history taught you nothing about this level of hatred? 
i think the #catholicchurch #pope #childabuse might have want them hands and this is not restricted to anyone faith or community. 
studies have shown that cvs submitted under a non muslim name are three times more likely to be offered an interview than those with a significant muslim name attached. 
yes, i would something to everything you would get your statistics when they are from far from the people and i do not have that that place of all as i do do to see how it in other society. 
that sounds like quite a violent threat. should i let the police know about this or? 
how about all muslims living living in western country? where do you doing and live in every world. 
muslims really have a lot of society with the west and doing intolerance and every world. 
source please? also, even if true how is this representative of all all islam? 
there are many religions than it is hard to compare them. which i guess islam has not that many traits that would make it the cruelest. 
provide example of those out the muslim community working. 
if it wasn't i would think islam would be a religion or or your children are what it seems to me me and will make up when it will make it. 
how can point have a person isn't this muslim? 
even if true, how does hatred counter hatred? 
dare to explain why? i see people from this religion to be valuable members of our society like the rest of us. 
violent verses in the qu'ran used by groups like isis to justify their evil atrocities have been cherry-picked without context and the qu'ran forbids cherry-picking as it is a holistic text. 
what if somebody is uk citizen and muslim? 
without islam and it is scholars, humanity would not have maths, science, or any of the other areas of knowledge that colonisers stole, claimed as their own then based western development on. 
the koran teached not really that fgm is really mean that of non-muslims accept this? 
if you had never said would you know until i thought but muslim we did not know about any other them. 
rapists are, in most cases, friends, family, or partners of the victim. the proportion of pakistani people who are rapists is no more than that of white british population. 
i suppose many people are so effective to women and murdering women and not not have to be about this 
islam is a part of our multicultural society, just like any other religion. accepting it is not 'appeasement', it is basic tolerance for others. 
many islamic scholars actively campaign against fgm, it is not mentioned in the qaran and a banned in a number of muslim countries. this is a cultural one. it a religious one. 
a british dog born in a british stable is not a horse, but its still british. we have obligations both 'to' and 'for' our citizen's, be they good evil evil surely? 
how can you say this about hundreds of millions of people? 
have you seen spoken to a mulsim? 
can i ask your what long things they actually brought to us? i cannot name any! 
i think what is your point? it looks like a place when people can live and do what they believe and believe even even the the west. 
yes, you could meet it looks looks a place where which actually say, 
the best way to beat hatred is not with more hatred. 
that is a sweeping statement to make for someone with such a flawed knowledge of how these disease spreads. 
what have 'all' pakistani people who do done to here, but why do you think someone to police and you? 
how can you say such about an statement of a religion of 1.6 billion people from all walks of life? 
far-right extremism has been named by the government as the biggest terrorist threat to the uk. these are the people you should be looking out for not, muslims. 
much more than 50 percent of parents out there are spankers.' - donald trump and isn't corporal punishment is currently legal in 19 states in the us? 
female genital mutilation occurs in non-muslim societies (including christian and animist ones) it is a cultural practice, not connected to religion. 
deported to where? the majority of muslims in the west were born here, you cannot send someone back to a place they have never been. 
all forms of hatred are wrong and should be countered. 
really? - we are talking learning and children who are taught here and most hate crime. 
the qur'an condemns rape, the fact that a few people ignorant of the teachings of the religion do that does not taint an entire religion. 
provide positive news story regarding mulsims. 
this is a false matter, but that all muslims are involved in such crimes, and not all people involved in it are muslims. 
the modern world should be in the problems that underlie migration, not simply ban it. 
that is a very serious charge. could you share how how form this thought and how you receive this information? the truth is that islam encourages people care for others and criticizes violence. 
that is what the vast majority of muslims means peaceful, normal lives, not fueled by violence, it looks like the problem is in fact with cultures and individual's attitudes. 
actually of british muslims who contribute to than 31 billion pounds to economy and who give more to charity than other religious groups. link to mend factsheet. 
how can you say that about 1.6 billion people? 
muslim unemployment stands at around 12%, not a great deal higher than white british unemployment. the problem is not muslims to it stop it is barriers to employment and a system that does not allow equality of opportunity between different faiths and cultures. 
so you are saying an entire faith of 1.6 billion is not peaceful? this is ignorant. 
who you forced to pray in a mosque? or observe all the rules? as far as i see it, muslims is their traditions, that is their right, but they do not convert anyone in our society. 
provide facts. 
though one is never allowed to be common in christians or christians which a cultural issue. 
you start digging if that keeps you happy. 
people have met in many muslim they create to our values. what are you like a long place where exactly are their problems without their community. 
[positive example of muslim community] when the muslim community [is doing this] do you really think someone's very existence is an excuse to project hate at them? clearly the muslim community doesn't. 
i mean, i am proud of our right to freedom of worship just the same as our right to freedom of speech. 
are you talking about the doctors doctors medical researchers researchers and and are cures for these illnesses? 
the companies can follow their own policies which are conditioned by globalization or marketing. it is not necessary to attribute everything to the muslim invasion. 
i have the right to blame other people. analysis showed that large majority of people convicted of sexual offences, regardless of the age of the victims, are white. 
i think the #catholicchurch #pope #childabuse have have more beaten hands down this is not restricted to anyone faith or community. 
all british religions play a significant role in organizing and directing social life, acting as agents for socialisation and social control? 
the real problem is that the amount of islamophobic hate speech that muslims face, not the book which their beliefs are based on. that is the hate which is having real and dangerous consequences. 
no muslims are modern and and western people like islam. 
the main way of a religion is to destroy other cultures? can you elaborate? having read more about islam, i can assure you that this is not what it stands for. 
the media is selective in the rape stories it shows. muslim perpetrators are vastly over-represented, and non-muslim offenders are often ignored in the headlines. https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/nov/11/84-per-cent-of-grooming-gangs-are-asians-we-dont-know-if-that-figure-is-right 
actually, prejudice discrimination seems making it have to cancel easter. stop its discriminatory against others. 
no, the qur'an does not instruct killing in any part of it. seriously, check your facts. 
evidence? all hatred is wrong and must be countered. 
a much bigger threat to our diverse, tolerant western civilisation is hatred generalised to entire religions. 
i am really good at making up stories, believing only the things i want and then then then it about it too. 
the same is pretty said to your voice of islamophobia! 
except when its need a taxi, a surgeon, a teacher, a train, a doctor, an olympic medal, great food, sounds a bit like a monty python sketch. 
aren't there a lot of people in britain (and the states) who want to bring back hanging? or is that different? 
public demonstrations of devotion and worship are hardly unique to islam. 
let's be honest a quick google search shows that simply isn't true. please tell me where on earth you managed to drag up those stats from? 
muslims have been work our part of western society and hundreds and hundreds of years and have been integral to its development, to try and separate the two is impossible. 
that is why they're surgeons, doctors, teachers, entrepreneurs. 
have you thought about the consequence child rapists might cause? 
[gif of someone laughing] if islamophobia is getting this weak, perhaps we have nothing to worry about. 
this is just false news! (attach unemployment and muslim that is the labour but we should better than you stop it and 'for' our citizen's, 
how can you say an entire community for a faith of 1.6 billion is not hatred. 
the best way to beat hatred is not with more hatred. 
that is a sad statistics. our society do do as much as it can to prevent such crimes. however, it is not true that immigrants are to blame. statistics shows that there are much more common among the natives. after all, they are at home here. 
except for muslims, the jesus who are muslim are allowed to live what is not belong to me one. why is your bad is. 
how can you say such hateful things about an entire faith? 
this religion also produces great artists, philosophers, historians, politicians, scientists! the proportion of criminals is present in every society. 
why do you think islam is evil? the major beliefs in islam encourage liberty, equality, and life. for instance, they teach people to respect for the lands and all creatures. 
turns out texts that predate modern civillisation often do not hold up to today's standards for tolerance and equality. shocking! 
then we did not legally prohibit asylum seekers from working, maybe more of them would be employed. 
the media scapegoats muslims and encourages division. when will you wake up and see you have been misled by institutions creating an 'us' and 'them' divide, demonising muslims to detract attention from bigger societal issues. 
a much hate, threat to worship it is any other you to say the majority of islam muslims. women if you can find out they are not the muslim too. 
but could true that muslims make up to 100 the years. out are the british who simply tell the majority of muslims were in the uk were stay by work. 
how exactly are muslims oppressing other cultures? do you think maybe spreading the religion that all people are homophobic and sexist demonises them and legitimises oppressing their culture? 
the only cover up that happens of the media is of the positive stories about muslims, extremist actions are the only ones ever highlighted. 
about such individual disrespecting other religion, you you mean how many millions of people and people from walks of life. 
i have never seen so many people celebrating christmas this year and as far as i know none of muslims were offended. so, what are you talking about? 
more groups in people peacefully gather to pray, because because they do not look like you, you are outraged? why am why not surprised? 
muslims, the supporters for islam, are the world of easter originally derived from pagan, islamic society really? 
muslim ideology is even more common in islam, and buddhism is even centuries older. are you say that ban all the religions? or are you specifically picky about islam? 
you cannot compare a faith of 1.6 billion to nazi. 
provide facts. 
in anyone but i wonder hate to started so many muslims in you. 
where exactly did you put people from remove from the uk, when they are the uk? 
iceland and switzerland are both named as countries at the top of the 'global peace index'. both have muslim populations. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
so 100 rapes are born born in europe to be this victim and contribute very very employment up. 
what somebody are a religion of school and all the faith that is a better toxic society. 
double standards all round lots of british culture and christian faiths oppress women, and and other cultures from #equalpay #metoo #timesup job restrictions in the church to condoning/ hiding sexual violence and child exploitation #thetruthproject. 
most muslims are too busy working hard, looking after their families and neighbours, propping up the nhs to be worried about such nonsense. 
the real problem here is the amount of islamophobic hate speech that muslims face, not the book which their beliefs are based on. that is the hate which is having real and dangerous consequences. 
why are you attacking muslims? many people come and live in britain and i do not see why it is a bad thing. 
there are bible scriptures about the stoning to death of virgins who do not scream when they are raped, we do not blame the bible for christian rapists. the quran. 
there's a few people i do not want here but deporting british citizens feels a bit like a dictatorship. 
no religion encourages violence towards others. i do not think islam is a muslim issue at all. 
muslims donate more to charity than any other group, contribute more than 30 billion pounds to the uk economy and make up a significant part of our nhs workforce. i think that is quite a nice contribution. 
islam does belong in any part of how how such hatred and misdirected entire 
how many muslim rapists are there? how many britain rapists? compare the numbers and make a conclusion for yourself! 
don't more a violence extremism they is no no they are violent does there in a one but that its muslims get a country as terrorist and let's 
fought in 2 world wars for us, provided medical care, made scientific advances, contributed to the economy massively. need i go on? 
[link to raheem stirling article or other biased media example] media bias against the muslim community has been going on for years, do not be fooled by it any more. 
actually the facts or it is just 0.01% of muslims feel might be extremists. so stop spreading false facts to bias public opinion. 
why would you call pakistan a disgusting country? it has the culture and values. we cannot say that every pakistani person is a rapist. thus, you should not insult people the pakistani people. 
judging as your comment here, if you have been refused service it is likely because of hateful conduct, not the colour of your skin. 
another rapist from england. we should ... 
in the uk, grooming gangs and their perpetrators are majorly white. 
are you blaming all community for the action of a few? doesn't seem very fair does it? 
machete attacks, rapes and killings have nothing to do with islam in general. bad people are met in every society. probably we should better check the people that are coming over our country, but it does not mean that everyone should be banned. 
how have you come to this conclusion? 
even horrible people are responsible for prove why why is it a war? 
#visitmymosque .and remind if you are willing to have an open calm discussion. muslim communities are already doing lots to stop the abuse in its name. just with the church is just with us who use themselves christian and use the church. but somehow your tone suggests you'd rather rant. 
no one's muslims do not ask questions. maybe did you did the answers would surprise you. 
muslims have been a part of european society for hundreds of years, what is not 'civilised' is your attitude towards them. 
could you show me some of clearly, that are more more to experience that do not where? there are crimes and work and children and discrimination for their life. if we really help people and true bad then in over our society in the prevention of cruelty in peaceful by the way with the prevention in cruelty to children. 
no islam does not evil. a religion or violence or violence. people. even even muslims might something to it, with the real is better crime. 
you feel like you are at respectful of your fellow human beings. cockroaches is such an endearing and humanising term. 
where do you mean? provide positive news story re islam. 
many muslims have engaged in protests to demonstrate their upset and disgust regarding the various grooming gangs scandals in the uk. 
if they were violent and looks like their excuse they're get an place in the evidence of your facts back on it. 
[link to muslim people cleaning newcastle streets after new year's celebrations] really? 
this is demonstrably false. muslims make up around 12% of unemployed people in the uk - the vast majority work hard and contribute to the uk economy. 
shouldn't religious freedom be celebrated? 
[positive example of muslim community] when the muslim community [is doing this] do you really think someone's very existence is an excuse to project hate at them? clearly the muslim community doesn't. 
violence is no more common in the bible than in the qur'an. (link to independent article about analysis of both books finding this). that noted, violence exists within and without religion. 
where did you get the figures from? because everywhere i look its a completely different story. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
i see the right to deport naughty foreign nationals should cut both ways? 
around 12% of muslims in the uk are unemployed, so do some basic research before posting fake statistics. 
and your evidence is. or does your logic stop there. 
it sounds like you are not this wrong in some of say, does hate hate hate hate hate do not know that the many that were in you? 
no religion is peaceful. every religion had been provoking religious wars and murdering people. islam is not that different in this respect from all religions. 
unicorns eat fairy dust, i said it has its a fact. 
my optician seems like a nice fellow, but i wonder why you think he is likley to kick off at a moments notice. 
everyone is a potential everything, what would you like to be? 
statistics and facts simply prove this wrong. 
the quran teached justice and that criminals should be treated justly and be given the chance to reform. 
no, bad people so much less diversity and cultural richness. 
how can you say this about an entire of group of people from all walks of life? 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
holocaust mk 2? are you really that person? 
christmas still must to be going ahead in the country, who exactly are these muslims are that offended by it? sounds like very news to me. 
no it isn't and most 'tolerant' places in the world accept all religions. 
have you forced to understand their their their their beliefs and our country, is our society. and you like to say this that them? 
all peoples have a place in every part of the world. 
no it is not just in all religious practice that is not hatred for people. 
that is misleading! the atlantic slave trade was mostly linked to christians, but no one calls it christian slave trade. 
that is not true. we are non-muslim terrorists out there. i seen it before 
are you blaming all community for the action of a few? doesn't seem very fair does it? 
i'd mean that so much the culture? islam, and beliefs is that this is where i think the law and solve and politicians and actual however, not that muslims have to society and 
can i suggest that a deportation of up to 3 million people, a large proportion of whom who born in the uk does not reflect 'our values' in the way i understand them. 
the world would be a better place without prejudice and hate mongers. why not do something that could really help children and support #truthproject. 
i am really sure making the quran that about more at the world tell for it makes islam? 
children should not use any that that with white men or anyone they do not know or even one's they do know if it does not feel right. suggesting only one group of men abuse leaves more children unsafe and vulnerable. 
sexism and prejudice aren't exclusively muslim. you have have to look at the church to see that. 
appeasement? the contrary, muslims are more likely to the uk and they over 31 billion pounds to the uk economy. they look like a valuable part of the community to me. (statistics from mend.org.uk) 
the value we should all abide by is respect and oppose ignorance. 
define western society? who chooses this? 
any muslims are those as long can every far of the different religions. 
inciting genocide is a crime under international law. 
why? all muslims are unemployed is is probably because of the discrimination they face, which tweets like this reinforce. 
i think people are banned is because they create insulting behavior and fear, which should be stopped. besides, the majority of muslims who follow islam are kind people. hence, i think we should decrease the criticism to islam or related ideology. 
most muslims have the place of new society for hundreds and centuries, they helped shape and design western society- to say they are incompatible is the complete incongruity. 
sources? this is hatred. 
so see to people suggesting that sex crimes and child sexual exploitation is not something that followers of other faiths are involved in? 
how can you say that about a faith of 1.6 billion people? 
i do not see muslims constitute the major fraction of our society. thus, i do not think the labour party is biased towarda them. 
but says 11% of muslim men and 16% of muslim women are unemployed, that took me 30 seconds to find on google. why bother making up things? 
26% of all doctors in the nhs are asian or asian seems like asian and them like to keep the google. 
enjoying your afternoon tea?? that came from india. 
if my dentist 'the let's the quran says: 'god does to love the aggressors.'? 
apart from the fact that you couldn't catch hiv like that, disease does it discriminate on religious grounds. 
rapism is banned in the muslim community equally to our community! it is not true to say that muslims do not care about such matters. they discuss it widely in their families, though not publicly. 
cearly this is not true and catch it do not representative of hatred actually 
can you have you said that everyone of thought about what how it is not? 
appeasement? 1.6 billion muslims are not the enemy? 
no child is 'forced fed' islam. parents retain the right to take their child out of any religious education. 
what are you trying to win? muslims in the uk aren't at war with anyone, the only thing creating conflict is islamophobic rhetoric like this, seeking to create a divide. 
are you talking about this. every muslim and was researchers treating and finding cures for these illnesses? 
but that does not at all undermine their contribution to public good and society, his allegiance is his own business. 
what is wrong with muslims living in europe? 
the only ones against islam and muslims are the ones that that are ignorant about what it truly is. 
i am not sure i do not know islam is another single, mono-culture isn't islamic teachings and crime. 
the muslim council of britain agrees that fgm is against islamic teachings. muslims disagree with fgm. stop spreading negative stereotypes! 
there is a lot of people in britain (and the states) who want to bring back hanging? or is that different? 
the only ones in favour of brexit are the ones that that are ignorant about what it truly is. 
islam and silence is tacit acceptance. given your voice against islamophobia! 
except when you need a taxi, a train, a doctor, an olympic medal, great food, sounds a bit like a monty python sketch. 
the quran does command muslim rape gangs. in muslim sexual violation is regarded by true muslims as as a violation of moral and divine law. 
black people get stopped by the police for no reason other than us black. muslims get surveyed by prevent just for being muslim. anyone would think english law has been persecuting muslims for hundreds of years. 
are you talking the muslim doctors and medical researchers treating and finding cures for these illnesses? 
wish i could use everything i read any crimes but keeps sneaking in. 
people's concerns must be based in evidence and not hatred. 
can i am you to mind your language? you are want to share with me with that? 
that is what the headlines suggest but actual cases where migrants are the abuser is just a drop in the ocean compared to the total number of cases. 
whilst a small number of muslims were involved in this, the vast majority stand against extremism (link to article about the muslim anti-extremism march in cologne) 
my friend, like quran, many ancient literatures in many cultures and died are still still reading. for example, the bible and the buddhist scriptures are read by all the world and translated to many languages. 
how many unemployed 'lazy' muslims do you know? there are no more work-shy muslims than there are people of any other faith. 
public demonstrations of devotion and worship are hardly unique to islam. 
i do not think that wanting to learn more about different countries can be described as envy? 
then show violent protesters in support of tommy r were muslims? 
have you ever spoken to a muslim? 
i do not think it is disgusting right that much. this country to me, which people should with rape nations and the idea people on such it is. 
christian europeans are the ones that then expanded the slave trade to an industrial scale and instrumentalised exploitation as a key component of our economy. 
what it is from your up that to know i agree the muslims in there being true about something it is. 
islamophobia and prejudice is making a judgement that may or may not be true of one person but then assuming it is true of all people like that . 
no, muslims are actually more likely to be the victim of a terrorist attack, especially those living in the middle-east. 
given that the vast majority of muslims live peaceful, normal lives, not fueled by violence, it looks like the problem is in fact with cultures and individual's attitudes. 
but i am sure the followers, who devote huge amounts of time to studying the koran and learning about islam are ignorant about ignorant about what it should them is. it is. 
evidence? 
really? all the muslims are criminals is no wrong. 
in the us, deports gangs were more in the uk shows we need not want to muslim against healthcare service. 
most muslims are too busy working hard, looking after their families and neighbours, propping up the nhs to be worried about such nonsense. 
isn't this misconception of western 'actions' and tolerance, there are peaceful and a way of bad opinions to this. 
once you burn books you burn people. has history taught you nothing? 
have you asked every single muslim about their opinion? i suppose not. then please do not speak for everybody! 
don't this religious text you stopped against when when are still by other or would you read read before the image rape, all all where you read up when live in muslims. 
maybe prejudice and xenophobia are incompatible with any western society? 
muslim's face huge amounts of discrimination and prejudice everyday the evidence is incontrovertible and yet most just keep going and working hard, its not playing the victim. 
you are not suggesting them we will be be non-religious or in public office? 
that sounds like quite a violent threat. should i let the police know 
the media scapegoats muslims and encourages division. when will you wake up and see you have been misled by institutions creating an 'us' and 'them' divide, demonising muslims to detract attention from bigger societal issues. 
they don't, but i do not only the official statistics but around muslims in the uk are british citizens but at growing really like a mental person i i think that is be think the first of a problem? 
are you sure? 12 muslim nobel prize winners would suggest otherwise. 
i do not think its being any religious text or such such a punishment. what is your point? 
or i suggest that we are victims of girls and muslims? and children experience that that are family does that rapists cases by white people. 
how are you seen what values [insert winners are build hatred. 
given that most majority of criminals among isis is this representative peace and islam. you can you say this about muslims are terrorism and terrorism and terrorism is simply that a muslim does a muslim community. 
by 'no one wants them here' do you mean just you specifically do not want them here? 
fake news and fear mongering does not help anyone, when you are ready for a rational discussion on stopping child rape, slavery or murders get in touch. 
are you talking about the muslim doctors and medical researchers treating and finding cures for these illnesses? 
dear friend, do not you think anti-muslim is another version of anti-semitic? i suggest that we stop racism, and hopefully once and for all. 
so a faith of 1.6 billion people from all walks of life helps make up humanity. 
child rapists are arrested and punished no matter what religion they follow. i do not think it is true that police does not counteract it. 
bloody please? also, even like an eye for the whole world blind! 
when you heard that the arab counter-terrorism coalition? 
have won every what? the only thing i see is paranoid messages like this painting a not so convincing picture of some sort of muslim originated threat. 
is this is a way forward? i do not think that religious practice is responsible for bad behaviour of our people. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
have you give to link a a good about people and prison for criticizing muslims? i cannot believe it until i see official data. 
child rapes are not only convicted by muslims. by fact, in fact, of sexual abuse are convicted by person known to the child. it is a sad truth. we should help children be free from sexual abuse and rape. 
a ban expressing would be a a stable and not a horse, schools. 
many faiths have changing to end inequality and persecution of women and gay people and each have people who resist that change. islam is no one or worse. 
except when you need a taxi, a surgeon, a teacher, a train, a doctor, an olympic medal, great food, sounds a bit like a monty python sketch. 
so more than 95% are fighting extremism and spreading peace and tolerance, there are extremists in every group. 
do you seem like you see a bit of crime in you. 
actually, i think your the couple millennia too late. 
what makes you have said or the west that caused. 
saying that all people of different religion are violent criminals does not make sense at all. 
by 'no one wants them here' do you mean just you specifically do not want them here? 
such numbers! are you saying that they can you give any more about evidence of that? 
you sound a bit paranoid mate, i do not think muslims feel the same way. 
that is quite a big generalisation, and obviously a false and discriminatory one too. 
oh the tolerant world that is spreading hate and fuelling discrimination against others? 
have you asked every single muslim about their opinion? i suppose not. then please do not speak for everybody! 
muslim victims is any more problems as any culture. 
actually appeasement with muslims is just tolerance and tolerance just still hiv to everything and misogyny to a minded or you good genders of people! 
my race could do stop all he had been known with the human so, but is the rape comes were in comparison? 
the only thing that is enough is this discriminatory hate speech. 
muslims are peace-loving, law-abiding and hard-working, contributing much to the uk economically and culturally. 
have you forgot that their religion is their their faith and 
this is just false news! islam, christianity and judaism have the same beginnings and the koran give special respect to the other two. 
the quoted report refers to 'countless faith schools' that illegally maintain gender segregation. isn't it more accurate to frame this as a country of lack of resources for enforcement, rather than presenting the story as an 'islamic issue'? 
sounds like incitement to me. 
so you are saying an entire faith of 1.6 billion is not peaceful? this is ignorant. 
a reassuringly positive poll, despite the negative spin you managed to put on it. 
the vast majority of muslims do not condone violence or rape. don't believe the sensationalist media stories that focus on a select few extreme cases, and under-report on non-muslim crimes. 
the 100 million pounds they donated to charity on ramadan must be part of that evil plan to blow everyone up. 
britain muslims means they are britishes who enjoy the right covered by the act. it is logical that labour party should first their right and voice as well. 
i think becoming a lot good our world but with the muslim western world and society, etc. but is a good part of our consumerism, what would agree to it. is a religion from it. 
[gif of someone laughing] if islamophobia is getting this weak, perhaps we have nothing to worry about. 
christianity and islam are united in preaching love and leaving judgment to god / allah what are you preaching? 
there is no 'them and us' we all must live together in respect, peace and understanding. 
sounds like you think they came from the moon. i have to say, i am sceptical. 
to say the majority of muslims were born peaceful, the home, by more than the the minority to those women get intolerance of lgbt offending really? 
even can you'd say such about an entire of group of people? 
evidence? 
but you said, it is one which is simply with the violent wars 
articles showing a opposite. 
islam does belong in our multicultural western society. unfortunately for you, intolerance doesn't. 
any person of (any) faith would understand that respecting responsibilities and tolerance, peace and justice is paramount. you you have a faith i am shocked that you would question it. 
i saw that bit of news, nothing to me with the world and your point? 
if they were refusing work then they will not be on benefits. so what is your problem. 
no, 1.6 billion people are not irrational and incompatible with science. 
no. a religion of 1.6 billion people is not the same as nazism and it is ignorant to say so. 
deported these rapists or criminals are deported back to their own countries after they finish their sentences. 
go me arabic cause 
do you really any of the muslim islam, just world where we advocate or hate or a exclusively extremism and that been perpetrated in the society is surely the one than more likely to the church to get child abuse within in the 
if you read qu'ran, you would know islam is compatible about any hate hate speech. it is. much in the truth. genocide will be criminals. 
do you think maybe the media paints this picture of islam to distract people from actual threats to civilisation, which are a conflict of interest for the powerful? climate change and capitalist exploitation spring to mind. 
so much hatred. we must respect and understand all peoples. 
the bible the quran and the torah are very very very similar in their teachings; if muslims are incompatible then we must ask ourselves religions religions are compatible? 
that is not a generalisation. what do 'all' muslims done to deserve being deported? 
what would jesus say? i do not think he would be religious intolerance and hate! 
muslims cannot celebrate their own holidays without fear of being targeted by islamophobic hatred. 
the very word islam, which means 'surrender,' is from the arabic salam, or peace - islam is not a violent religion. 
many victims of terror are muslim. 
i feel think you would making the race hate will be hate it. 
on 100 million pounds they donated to charity on ramadan must be part of that evil plan to blow everyone up. 
of i will not tolerate oppression of all groups by muslims more than than tolerates sexual of these groups is anyone else. 
discrimination by employers in europe against muslims has been noted to be a cause of lesser employment figures of muslims in the workforce. 
these are wicked words. but it one said said that, does it mean that everyone agrees with it 
don't all religions play a significant role in organizing and directing social life, acting as agents for socialisation and social control? 
as you a violent acts is all any culture. rape or non-muslim is something by true intolerance and 
nah, you think that is too much effort for our politicians. 
to be fair, the ofsted report is more concerned with lack of enforcement and less about focussing on the practice of any particular faith. 
the only thing muslims are trying to 'win' is the right to exist free from discrimination and dehumanising hate like this. 
most muslims feed the homeless, offer shelter, work in hospitals, schools and keep the country going. maybe we should invite more? 
so if we should the allow the foreign nationals should cut both ways? 
7 muslim nobel peace prize winners would say otherwise. 
or occupied palestine, apartheid south africa, ireland during the troubles, seems many homophobes and racists, some parents, my old pe teacher and many, many state schools in the us. 
dog's and horse's do not have passports. a stable isn't a country, and matters of nationality and citizenship are legal constructs, rather than genetics. 
you have not remember that many of major men in this being perpetrated as a muslim shooter. 
islam's teachings uphold religious and personal freedoms, are these the western values you mean? 
it sounds like you are saying this have you have to christian to be tolerated, bit paradoxical do not you think? 
sorry i think your a couple millennia too late. 
islam is the same roots as christianity and judaism and all are based on love, tolerance and peace, so that is a good thing isn't it. 
violence is not muslim issue. especially all the violence being endured by muslims due to hateful intolerance and discrimination. 
fgm is not only practised by muslims. it is a cultural practice regardless of anyone's religion. 
pretending islam is why a religion of 1.6 billion people from all walks of life. 
my dentist told me the quran says: 'god does not love the aggressors.'? 
muslims 'believe' in jesus' birth, they might not be a traditional celebration for many but it is really not a cause for offense either. 
i feel like you are grasping at straws here with your hate speech. 
actually, the fbi considers the largest terrorist threat right now to be from far-right extremist groups. 
but i think you mean the statistics who will get child and islam wasn't from germany and elsewhere from northern europe view muslims favorably. 
if the religious text written thousands of years ago was published today you could say the same. have you read the bible's old testament? 
looks to me like supermarkets just want to sell more products to people regardless of faith. 
any person of (any) faith would understand that our responsibilities towards tolerance, tolerance, and justice is paramount. if you have a faith i am shocked that you would question it. 
the quoted report refers to 'countless faith schools' that illegally maintain gender segregation. isn't it more accurate to frame this as a matter of lack of resources for enforcement, rather than presenting the story as an 'islamic issue'? 
can i suggest that the deportation of up to 3 million people, not large proportion of whom were born in the uk does not reflect 'our values' in the way i understand them. 
muslim people i know are strongly against any crime, and rapism is a sin in islam. they talk to their children about that. thus, they indeed counteract such cases. 
what do you think it is then? 
evidence? 
islamophobia and prejudice is making a judgement that may or may not be true of one person but then assuming it is true of all people like that . 
apart from the fact that you couldn't catch hiv like that, disease does not discriminate on religious grounds. 
the same encourages western pursuit of new knowledge and understanding. that sounds quite compatible with science to me. 
child rapists are a tiny sick minority across all communities. islam does not condone it and muslims do not accept it. 
violence is only permitted in the qu'ran through means of self-defence. 
source please? also, even if true how is this representative of all islam? 
the often ignored fact is that muslims are some of the largest victims of isis and within the isis-controlled community itself. 
how can you say this about an entire of group of people from all walks of life? 
can i suggest that of the report acts in 3 million people, been a large proportion of whom were born in the uk does not reflect 'our values' in the way i understand them. 
stop any religious text written thousands of years ago was published today you could say the same. have you read the bible's old testament? 
generalised and offensive language and diversity is a strength. 
islam has belong in western countries and society. for centuries. the scapegoating of muslims as a threat is what is really worrying in our society. 
[fact check and post link to accurate statistics, statistic is likely false or extremely skewed][add meme] smh trying to post statistics when they're not even accurate. 
british muslims are more to charity than any other religious group, i'd call that a pillar of our society. 
sexualization of children is a modern value? do you actually know what is meant by values? 
good luck! try not to talk to anyone or you might just get some perspective. 
what all the muslim muslim community is that our islamic etc. but does make this is find right or this is not all of muslim community. 
surely a discriminatory comments like this like what are be common to be hatred. 
what, you mean people people who spend their lives and learning and practicing islam do not know what its really about? 
islamic cultures led europe out the dark ages into the era of enlightenment and gave rise to its renaissance. now they contribute over 30 billion pounds to the uk economy; quite a large contribution by anyone's estimation. 
so race hate started when westerners could not tolerate other people who had different beliefs? 
deported to where? the majority of muslims in the west were born here, you cannot say someone back to a place they have never been. 
i guess you know they came but you, muslims are britain in uk? i am sure of people them to create and and and hate too. 
would you say the same if this was about say, tibetan buddhists suffering the same sort of coercion? 
sounds more like the catholic church to me #pope#childabuse #inquirycsa. 
islamic cultures have shaped for the better our science, arts and medicine. muslims are invaluable in keeping our hospitals transport running, going, and much more. which of those which you think like get rid of? 
the koran does not command this. 
what do you mean? your point are you making? 
studies in the us show the majority of terrorist incidents are committed by right-wing extremists, not muslims. be critical of what you read, the news is very biased. 
this is just false statistics. islam, christianity and judaism have still care beginnings and the koran give special respect to the other two. 
turns out texts that predate modern civillisation often do not hold up to today's standards for tolerance and equality. shocking! 
how exactly are muslims oppressing other cultures? do you think maybe spreading the opinion that all muslims are homophobic and sexist demonises them and legitimises oppressing their culture? 
how many muslim rapists have there? how many many rapists? compare the numbers and make a conclusion for yourself! 
the we would have western people and respect that means a 
being religious has never stopped anyone from being in public office before. christians have allegiance to god, is that not the same thing? 
christianity isn't exactly 'indigenous', given jesus was born in bethlehem! 
tbh i am struggling to find any chocolate eggs which are not labelled as easter eggs. 
how do you say that people are never a religion to people have any crimes of our crimes. 
it would not solve the hate and persecution that plagues these comments. 
why should not call it to disgusting or do not even at what there is one is would 
islam isn't given long sisterhood of tolerance and understanding across the world. 
good right try do to how to their nhs running, trains running, taxis going, hard working people fed, late night emergency beer runs possible then yeah, its mental. 
many victims of those is muslim. 
so all the muslim doctors, business owners, servicemen/women, taxi drivers, chefs, etc. that i've encountered must be part of that 1% then? 
well their world would would be the next without without hate speech everyone isn't not the book book that that here was peace. 
why would you say that? british government has its strict immigration policy which does not allow every religion or islam or 
in fact, there are some verses in quran advocate women's right. here are some of them: equal responsibilities and reward; right to earn money. 
what many muslims are trying to 'win' muslims are ever good to our mills to more to the other religion? 
if that were really true why are there so many union flags around then? should we report the queen next time she is home? 
have you ever spoken to a good news stories about muslim? 
because victorian girls and women were treated equally with respect? that was when there no muslims in the country. if we really much better now? #metoo? 
atheists like chocolate too! 
sounds very very bit like the bible i do not think we are this? why do me statistics but will the statistics when we will see getting one opinion. as a a value, and the poll seems to confirm this? 
let's a quick google search shows that your stats are plain wrong wrong everything and 2) most global terrorism is motivated by politics and not religion. that is why no one is talking about it. 
no because saying is not only all undermine lack and understanding public people. 
seems odd that that western society was build on the backs of the rest of the world. 
many rapes are also committed by non-muslim perpetrators. are you picking out muslim rapists selectively to support the ideology you are trying to propagate? 
my friend, this world is not perfect. the experienced world did we and ii, economic recession, political crisis, etc. us is a christian-majority country, yet it holds the world's largest arms exporter and engages in several armed conflicts. islam cannot explain all of these. 
violating of right for underrepresented communities (homosexuals, women, disabled people) takes place everywhere, and many native western people are also held accountable for it. oppressing rights is not the feature of islam but of our society in general. 
islam is also given our world many benefits, such as mathematics and architecture. it is impossible to take it out of our life! 
if we invite people to live and work in muslim schools in this top the the place to the industrial 
there is the crime going within in communities, - you you stop the stop it in it been committed by the it. 
you should not be open doctors, teachers, doctors, doctors, oh and scientists, lunatics? world that keep keep transport transport and working working fed and is just working and corner 
if we would know they would ever democratic? but others else but it did not in by the best or tradition or search 
if fgm is is a religion of christians and some other than in holy trump but we think its vast majority of muslims are kind and hate or hate like it? 
any individual may become a terrorist. religious beliefs do not play part in this. 
to all many the western people in new society. 
why you ask people to pakistan that wrong. how many muslim crimes and they are so every the other religion and you here. 
doing it right'? i do you really have to moral compass upside down! 
if they were violent they would have been punished too. why do you think someone of a certain religion is automatically guilty? 
why would you say it is because of muslims? to me, globalization and tourism would explain different why easter eggs are being labelled 'chocolate eggs'. 
that is a sad statement i do not see wrong as such religion, and responsible for hate if it has their country based here. if you imprison people based on islam that and then would be chauvinism. 
so the headscarf impedes brain function? seems like your problem is sexism and misogyny not islam. 
ha, well you been wrong to chocolate people if you give more than different people and 
dwp says 11% of muslim men and 16% of muslim women are unemployed, that took me 30 seconds to find on google. why bother making up things? 
what is your hatred of muslims contributing to our western society like intolerance and causing divide? 
the only purpose of a religion who do to their society for spreading intolerance of causing divide? 
please provide evidence and true true hatred does not justify hatred. 
isn't this story about islamic community. 
gender segregation in faith schools is clearly a negative, hardly hardly exclusive to some islamic schools. i was 15 before i attended mixed classes, but then, this was regarded as normal in the 1960's / 70's. the issue is really, if we are to work based for education, we need effective mechanisms to uphold standards, and legal requirements. 
to be fair, i would guess its hard to feel a sense of belonging when you are perpetually identified as a problem? 
many muslims are changing to end inequality and persecution of women and gay people and each have people who resist that what islam is no better or worse. 
islamic civilization led europe out of dark ages into the era of enlightenment and gave rise to its renaissance. now they contribute over 30 billion pounds to the uk economy; quite a large contribution by anyone's estimation. 
do you actually a hundred of all of how about islam to distract people from actual threats to civilisation, which are a conflict of interest for the powerful? climate change and capitalist exploitation spring to mind. 
are you purposely trying to avoid good news stories about muslim? 
that is what the headlines suggest where actual cases where migrants are the abuser is just a drop in the ocean compared to the total number of cases. 
and most were were here for because because of muslim 'civilised' 
easy to blame others isn't it, that way we do not have to look at our own sexism. 
what? 
what is wrong with learning living in europe? 
who are you to decide what you compatible with our values and what is not? it is just your opinion, and hopefully politicians will not listen to people like you and oppress muslims who had not done anything wrong. 
how many muslim rapists are there? how many britain rapists? compare the numbers and make a conclusion for yourself! 
i do not think it is possible for a group that has been a part of biased society like hundreds of years to suddenly be 'incompatible' with it. are you sure it is not western society's intolerance that is the problem? 
the ons says 55%of victims are assaulted by a partner or ex partner. lock up all married people (and divorcees)! 
but as well most non-muslims would not allowed by do by law, people also due to work violent and search against the church to authority by a far and does not not think to protect children start from #truthproject. 
my dentist told me the quran says: 'god does not love the aggressors.'? 
hatred cannot be openly discussed and must be countered. 
how can you say this about an entire faith? 
so the muslims quite a dogs, animals and if you have all of the other people even non believers, like god do not based on hate and 
do you think any people suffer will be a family islam, i isn't world better? i think rape would create hate, anger, and fear, which would make things worse. 
you mean you do not want them here, most everyone else does, sorry. 
you also aware there are millions of muslims that add from society and the economy which would collapse. 
when 400,000 muslims died in ww1 for britain, seems to me like this hate is very one sided. 
ooer, you might meet someone that looks a bit different to you. 
the companies who follow their own policies which are conditioned by globalization or marketing. it is not necessary to attribute everything to the muslim invasion. 
i saw that bit of news, nothing to do with the man peeing on the floor and punching a security guard then? that was allowed and he was chucked out for wearing a flag. 
the best way to beat hatred is not with more hatred. 
i'd think the root of all the world problems today is over-population and ecology. why do you blame islam in all the problems? 
muslim radicalism is no thing, and generalizations about all muslims is another thing. it is not right to generalize about all the muslims and state that 'we hate them all!'. 
this feels like a science fiction if you ask me! 
criminals are checking on a person's faith before the commission of their crimes? seems a lot of bother to me. 
the world would not a first place without your intolerance, it only creates a divided, toxic society. 
don't mix up politics and faith. no faith really encourages violence, the way politicians (on every side and nation) interpret them however, is a different story. 
i personally think its make the the commercialisation of a religious festival, rather than any 'betrayal of our culture', as such. atheists like chocolate too. 
how have the come to offensive this about re what you is. what is just hatred. 
many people are trying to end inequality and persecution of women and gay people and people have people who resist that change. islam is no better or worse. 
where did you get this figure from? because i get some real evidence for this? because this seems very much unrealistic. 
islam is a religion of every faith including it so any other religion. 
shall we also ban coffee, paper, guitar, the english language, algebra, vaccinations against disease, canals, hospitals, the numeric system and every other contribution to 'civilised europe' from the islamic world? 
have said in west law. indeed, all at women will be deported back anyone back the home after after still go time do not allowed the treatment. everyone as the blame. 
if there more work with any other muslim group, i'd children that domestic is a bigger tolerant of islamophobic problem than as much the the biggest is causing 
are you talking about the arab counter-terrorism coalition? 
what about islam with learning about any teachings of love good statement to offensive what you will be more information? the many many muslims 
this is every disgusting thing to say, you would not say this about non-muslims would you? 
clearly, when they are working, shopping etc they are paying taxes? this is also a contribution to a society.in economic terms! 
therefore, 62% of britons see no incompatibility between islam and 'british values'. 
i think this is a very inconsiderate thing to say, would you say this same thing about non-muslims as well? 
but as british turned it into an art form to rape and pillage across the world. 
how exactly are you suggesting? 
people's concerns must be based in evidence and not hatred. 
so what makes muslims born in the uk whose national flag is the union jack? 
the world would not a place place without people were more tolerant to each other. 
google polygamy individual to to 'civilized' case. about about the islamic responsibilities is a less of where are just more as 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith of people? 
race hate has always had its roots in far right paranoia. migrants in the uk have always worked hard and made a positive difference to the communities they joined. 
in what way? 
i think becoming has a very inconsiderate thing to say, would you say the same thing about non-muslims as well? 
there are really back in the law and the lands aren't these as it is not the true is the government is we we keep the bible, the torah, etc. 
by 'no religious person would here' do you mean just just what is just and 
what point and hatred is hatred. 
doesn't 'prohibition' always fail because it adds a certain glamour that porudes the opposite of the intended effect? 
child sex abuse happens in all religions. you only have to look at what the vatican covers up to see that. 
may you remind you to mind your language? do you want to share me with your anger, maybe i can help you? 
if you excluded everyone who had prejudice, who will be left? 
the problem is, it seems to me like you are just using this as an excuse to express your islamophobia. fgm is a very serious breach of human rights and you do not seem to be interested in tackling the real problem. 
yes, except of hiv is more common among christians and may not a contact disease. 
slavery long predated islam, they inherited slavery and proceeded to improve conditions. way ahead of the rest of the world. 
if they were violent would would have been punished too. why do you think someone of a certain religion is automatically guilty? 
this is simply not true and how can you say this about such a large group of people from all walks of life? 
no one muslims also therefore islam muslims in western nations and add so much positivity. 
a book published thousands of years ago does not fit we today's standards of tolerance and acceptance? shocking! 
that sounds very extreme, remind me again group group is the violent dangerous one? 
evidence for this? this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
the only thing muslims are trying to 'win' this is right to exist free from discrimination and dehumanising hate like this. 
islam is an evil. religion, of islam is not hateful. towards violence in any religion. of one aren't it in terrorism is terrorist violent (link to one on. 
no it isn't and most 'tolerant' places in the world accept all religions. 
imho the stain is from those individuals who love to stereotype, discriminate and dehumanise who groups of people. 
do you really think you would believe in this only only by islamic muslims? you cannot want them then hate with disgusting. 
example? 
do you know that domestic violence is even a bigger problem in our society? we should first deal with our inner problems and then blame other people. 
complete freedom, justice and democratic values. the values at the heart of islamic faith. i think they seem reasonable. 
this is not true. why do you think this? 
where did you get violent statistics? 
they are innocent. if we would tolerate their right in public were populist here maybe to the next about the 'homophobic muslim' stereotype) 
it is quite literally not. 
learning different religions and we must live in the inclusive society is nonsense? i strongly disagree. 
don't decide people share people we want to live and and not care / practicing together should be a place without how haven't also know on the findings and a positive out 
list of famous muslim females. 
islam is an ancient religion, and it is not hateful. you can ask any specialist in religion, islam has nothing to deal with hate. if we imprison people based on their religious views, that would be chauvinism. 
criminals are given on punishment if they are guilty. doesn't matter of their race is. why are you so sure that the government is trying to cover things up? 
muslims work in many diverse employment sectors, contributing to the uk's through through their hard work and tax contributions. 
how many muslim rapists are there? how many britain rapists? compare the numbers and make a conclusion for yourself! 
given that a belief in the rule of law is generaly cited as a 'british value' - surely its important that this person is returned to the uk to stand trial for whatever crimes they may have committed? 
isn't this a 'have you stopped beating your wife?' question.? 
but that would really much at keep the catholic trains arts and going, exploitation before hard and any british people of faith. 
really? cause it seems problems in this country are caused by hatred and intolerance. 
there are a lot of non-muslim terrorists but the media focuses on christian terrorists and does not call the non-muslim ones terrorists. when was the last time you say a white non-muslim school shooter in the us branded a 'terrorist'? 
[fact check and post link to accurate statistics, statistic is likely false or extremely skewed][add meme] smh trying to post statistics when they're not even accurate. 
i do not think muslims constitute the major fraction of our society. thus, i do not think the labour party is biased towarda them. 
are you accusing all the britain in the antisemitism? i disagree, from my experience they are just usual people who do not show their hate towards anybody, they just live their lives. 
no, the qur'an muslims does not instruct killing in any part of it. seriously, check your facts. 
have you actually spoken to muslim about this? does people celebrating christmas actually offend them? i would be keen to know. 
explain? this is not true and how can you say this about an a faith of people from this walks of life? 
there is already work going within muslim communities, just as there is across the rest of society, it is just not reported on. 
i'd think the same threat is divisive comments like this. 
ever mind a bit of praying in public, how to we we the salvation army waking us up of a sunday with 'onward christian soldiers'. a working man deserves a lie-in! 
do you think the home of childhood are a potential lot without our this is. 
i have met so many muslim people adhering to british values. what do you base your view on? 
where is your evidence for this? this is just hatred. 
race hate has always had its roots of far right paranoia. migrants in the uk have always worked and and made a positive difference to the communities they joined. 
many groups of people feel excluded for many reasons and should be supported. 
actually, the qur'an teaches chastity and condemns sexual abuse. gangs gangs doing this are not abiding by muslim teachings, and are denounced by true muslims. 
aren't places of worship about far more than just prayers? 
have you ever spoken to a muslim? 
doesn't 'prohibition' always fail because it adds a certain glamour that porudes the opposite of the intended effect? 
it is just so hard to take you seriously when your islamophobia, misogyny and disablist language combined make you seem excessively uninformed. 
even if i do not think islam to be offensive.? 
but we i think islam of the right to freedom of worship than the uk and discrimination from misunderstanding. 
the world would be be a very dark place without muslims who contribute a lot to our society. what about our society. doctors, scientists, philanthropists, actors, job-creators. 
tbh as well if everything been been abused for it by your up to the christian who can go out child or or not a rule. i think it children has always more about children in the nationality. 
the yorkshire ripper' said god told him to committ his atrocitites. in neither case is this a justification. individuals are responsible for their actions, not whatever warped interpretation of a particular faith they cite as possible cause. 
whilst a few number of muslims were involved in this, the vast majority stand against extremism (link to article about the muslim anti-extremism march in cologne) 
that is like quite a generalisation. what are let muslims done to deserve being deported? 
then when the violent protesters in support of tommy r were muslims? 
did you show bother to google this before you tweeted it? some islamophobic tweets are so incorrect i do not know how you could expect anyone to believe them. 
islamophobia and prejudice is making a judgement that may or may not be true of one person but then assuming it is true of all people like that . 
why is this a muslim issue? a faith of 1.6 billion all violent? 
muslims have been a part of european society for hundreds and years, what is 'civilised' 'civilised' is your attitude towards them. 
so when the white person kills someone, they're called a murderer. when a minority does it they're labelled a terrorist. we need to combat violent acts in all their forms. if we focus on just so group then we are blind to the rest of the problem. [picture of iceberg]. 
think you are really concerned about stopping and children then support the #truthproject and maybe read some of the findings and a real picture of grooming and child exploitation. 
islam has existed alongside and within western civilisation for centuries. the scapegoating of muslims as a threat is what is really worrying in our society. 
i want to you. however, the word of muslims in the rape societies without the mix of just 
yes, that is a great 'civilized' way to maintain your 'civilized' country from these terrible 'uncivilized' people. 
is this about the muslim community is this a problem that our teachings of people often agree that people and they cover care for it? eggs. 
ooer, you might meet someone that looks a bit different to you. 
sounds very much like incitement to me, do be careful. 
what is that? muslims are around world to build western women and all peoples. 
my friend, but do not think all western people hate islam. statistics showed that france, germany and elsewhere in northern europe view muslims favorably. 
this is not true. how can you say this about 1.6 billion people? 
this is simply not true. 
non-muslims are a hundred similar images of christian including those in the kkk standing next to their victims who used the bible as a justification. of course none of believe believe they represent all christians. 
enjoying your afternoon tea?? that came from india. 
no, christian world can be far from tolerant. muslims in the us are more likely to have tolerant attitudes toward lgbt people than christians. maybe we can all learn something from them? 
don't trust police, social workers or anyone who can tell you the truth and show just how prejudiced and misleading this tweet is. 
violence cannot actually more common in the bible in all the qur'an. (link to independent article about analysis of muslim books finding this). that noted, violence exists within within without religion. 
violence is apparent in the religious books. can christianity be blamed for inciting it in the old testament? 
this is a sad matter, but not all muslims are involved in such crimes, and not all people involved in it are muslims. 
islam is belong in our multicultural western society. unfortunately for you, intolerance doesn't. 
the only reason these gangs exist in the first place is because they do not have an institution like the bbc or the church to shield them. 
why do you stereotype and generalise an entire community for actions of a few? 
the qur'an does not tolerate killing and these of the us to muslims any other cultures. it is misunderstanding. these and it is muslims. 
what exactly are you suggesting? 
according to crown prosecution service's source, at least 80% white people convicted of child abuse offences. what is this happen? we should stop hating and complaining others, and protect children and women from sexual crimes. if you want to help, please contact national society for the prevention of cruelty to children, lucy faithful foundation, or independent sexual violence advocates. 
muslims have been in europe since the 6th century and they belong here as much as anyone else. 
there are churches of muslim countries like turkey, uae, morrocco. what is your point? 
isn't this a 'have you stopped beating your wife?' question.? 
most of terror are more muslim. they read advocate the vulnerable and the lot of the non-muslim extremism does that one majority of us only rape crimes. 
try running the nhs without them and other migrants! 
even if we said you'd respect tolerance and hate give that the law is bad violence and support their culture and 
positive news story about muslim community. 
please check this [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/aug/01/immigrant-muslim-cancer-research] 
the vast majority of global terrorism is about politics and land not faith. one fact you do not seem to want to deal with. 
do you mean maybe much being country and if you did not think having the law? for am it is one of a religion without some group you seem to be the world you happened to uk type in one is it correct 
you seem to be suggesting that sex crimes and child sexual exploitation is not something that followers of other faiths are involved in? 
yes, such offensive language and diversity is a strength. 
are seriously suggesting these things did not happen until we invited people from the indan sub-continent to come and work in our mills and factories? 
homophobia and sexism aren't not muslim attitudes, there are many non-muslims who are homophobic, sexist, and intolerant of other cultures. the qur'an teaches tolerance and peace. 
[gif of someone laughing] if islamophobia is getting this weak, perhaps we have nothing to worry about. 
accepting people from all walks of life is not an illness. 
sounds more like the catholic church to me #pope#childabuse #inquirycsa. 
you decide whether or not people are intelligent based on their religion? well, this is not a way forward. 
no. this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
that sounds a lot like terrorism to me. 
actually looking like you think you'd me what its it is to me or just because of hate cannot you? your one group like your search as the news, you seem to me as you facts to get an country and 
actually, the principle of muslims is to love and respect everyone. this is the same as our values. if you talk to a muslim, you will find out that they are kind and friendly people too. 
if any people are unemployed it is probably because of the discrimination they face, which tweets like this reinforce. 
because it person do not a fact based this hate simply not discriminatory and hate cannot be bad false 
there is no 'them and us' we all must live together in respect, peace and understanding. 
this is not disgusting to me say that muslims are being differently of any other of the religion do something or to get more. statistics by most of even as a few examples that child children and isis. 
muslims have been a part of european society for hundreds of years, what is not 'civilised' is your attitude towards them. 
you are right, if you experience hate in any form, report it. 
the majority of muslims worldwide are peaceful. 
muslim, of aren't muslim community that a loyalty to the uk to contribute to any oppression of those who in the fact 
there is centuries old islamic communities in europe. 
the government is not allowed any crimes. instead, they are working on it. please contact the local police office or ngo for any advices or solutions. 
you are aware there are millions of muslims that add to society and the economy which would collapse. 
i thought we'd stopped exporting our convicted criminals criminals last century. now you advocate exporting people wihtout a trial or a conviction. 
playing the victim and blaming other cultures for violence? sounds like a far-right tactic to me. 
only there a lot of people in britain (and the states) who want to bring back hanging? or is that different? 
so all the muslim doctors, business owners, servicemen/women, taxi drivers, chefs, etc. in our country are in fact unemployed? how do they pull that off! 
using intolerance and discrimination against anyone different? sounds like a bit issue. 
if it wasn't for a muslim i would not have my surgery, been cared for afterwards, made it back home, had something to eat during the following weeks. 
where did you get your figures from? because everywhere i look its a completely different story. 
let's a quick google search shows that your stats are plain wrong wrong everything and 2) most global terrorism is motivated by politics and not religion. why is why no one is talking about it. 
how can you say such hateful things about an entire faith? 
can you actually any more appearances of terror and crisis? i do not mean it in our society. 
a large proportion of nhs workers are asian, and many muslim. without them we would not have a free 24/7 healthcare service. 
when i last looked there are some few words, just pictures of chocolates, that what makes us want chocolate and sells the eggs. 
you decide whether or not people are intelligent based on their religion? well, this is not a way forward. 
the quran does not command rape gangs. in fact, sexual violation is regarded by true muslims as as a violation of moral and divine law. 
britain muslims means they are britishes who enjoy the right covered by the act. it is logical that labour party should consider their right and voice as well. 
this is demonstrably false. muslims make up around 12% of unemployed people in the uk - the vast majority work hard and contribute to the uk economy. 
this is generalization. maybe the case you mentioned is just the minority. besides, some governments even destroys pepople's house. we should pay much more attention to this instead. 
a real disgrace would be children not being taught about all religions and growing up with a narrow mindset. 
[gif of someone laughing] if islamophobia is getting this weak, perhaps we have nothing to worry about. 
a nation from all as the police is a whole religious practice as often often violent (link to other crimes. the christian religion. 
every single muslim? even our olympic champions, tv celebrities, surgeons, doctors, teachers, scientists, all those who keep the nations transport infrastructure going. you really think they have no place in civilisation? 
if you are saying that we should not allow non-religious people into public office? 
yes, you should monitor your own hate speech before pointing the finger at others? 
the world would actually a better place without one and hate mongers. why not do something that really could help children and support #truthproject. 
we are start a lot of discrimination and prejudice from from targeted from this is not trying to be minorities and the look to all the man individual as your 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? this is just hatred. 
are you suggesting we should not be democratic? or or public office is not won by merit, hard work and excellence. perhaps we should try nepotism? 
surely this is not hatred. but can have be faith so have what this is. not your bad where 
this is just false news! islam, christianity and judaism have the labour beginnings and the koran give special respect to the other two. 
evidence? 
what someone who is working / studying and trying to build their life there should be suddenly sent back to their home countries? 
i have so many amazing muslim friends. i do not want them deported. what is your reasoning? 
so that 'sisterhood of tolerance and understanding' is challenging sexism everywhere including those men feel women they feel what they can they believe and they believe in how as how to their lives. 
today, in many muslim-majority community, were receive equal, even higher in some places, treatment as men. for example, many women as as scientists, engineers, lawyers, etc. 
95% of muslims live in the uk are unemployed, please do some basic research before posting fake 
common sense definition: 'good sense and sound judgement in practical matters'; prejudice definition: 'preconceived opinion that is not based on reason or actual experience'. nope your wrong. 
i thought could remember the many of grand soldiers, of muslims shares the islam is the muslims. 
deported work in many diverse and sectors, contributing to the uk's economy through their hard work and tax contributions. 
every muslim is also a potential peacemaker, doctor, philanthropist. what is your point? 
oh! you mean the home of modern maths and science? 
biased media coverage over-represents muslims as committing these crimes. how much media attention does the vatican's child sex abuse scandal got in comparison? 
a real disgrace would be children not being taught about other religions and growing up with a narrow mindset. 
race tolerance has always its live in the right and two communities? 
if someone's agitating for war and death, we should deal with them directly. but as you correctly point that out, muslims that the people are not connected to the offensive statements and are just peaceful muslims. 
the opposite of oppression is choice the vast majority of muslim women in muslim have choice. 
you are right, if not experience hate in any form, report it. 
fake news from fear mongering mongering does not help anyone, when you are ready for a rational discussion on stopping child rape, slavery or murders get in touch. 
try running the nhs without them and other migrants! 
there is nothing to raise your voice to. have you ever spoken to your local muslim community? 
the law is to protect and defend people, as well as regulate behavior in a society, so does english law. words hurt. if a brit person hurts others, it is logical to get punishment. 
stop the life. for me more of discrimination and the are more than this is your excuse to prevent the ideology - there is the blame. 
not sure how far dismissing 10% of the world's population will get us. 
how many times have you seen evangenical christian preachers and followers on the streets most saturday's in most uk cities? you do not think that other faiths should be allowed the same? 
many groups of people feel excluded for many reasons and should be supported. 
such dehumanising language against many people. 
tolerance is not limited to one religion, or only religion at all. if you plenty of tolerant muslims. the issue, it seems, is being more being intolerant of islam. 
isis is an extrem of islam and does not represent muslims' belief and action. indeed, most of islam condemned the action of isis. 
there are no islamic invaders and this is just hatred. 
muslims donate much to charity than any other group, contribute more than 30 billion pounds to the uk economy and make up a significant part of our nhs workforce. i think that is quite a nice contribution. 
are you sure about this? have you interviewed every single person is this country? tell me more about this. 
yes, that is a great 'civilized' way to maintain your 'civilized' country from these terrible 'uncivilized' people. 
appeasement? 1.6 billion muslims could not the enemy? 
christianity and islam are united in preaching love and leaving judgment to god / allah what are you preaching? 
islam has existed alongside and within western civilisation for centuries. the scapegoating of muslims as a threat is what is really worrying in our society. 
i do not see your opinion, but i do not acknowledge that opinions, mine or your, do not have to be based on fact or knowledge. my 'experience' of muslims, as neighbours, colleagues, friends hasn't led me to view them as a problem. 
what do you say that? 
surely they must work faith and eradicate across the country in others? 
have you also spoken to a mulsim? 
we are really doing this. this. in there are keep the uk and there is there is the country. besides, the one of muslim and do not think you should be stopping. 
replace islam with any other religion and see just how deeply offensive what you just said is. 
this is not true. 
do you know that anti-islamism is actually a form of anti-semitism? it is equally wrong to intolerant jews and muslims. 
islam has existed alongside and within western civilisation for centuries. the scapegoating of muslims as a threat is what is really worrying in our society. 
it is just more hard to take you seriously when the islamophobia, misogyny and disablist language combined make you seem excessively uninformed. 
no. a religion of 1.6 billion people is not the same as nazism and it is ignorant to say so. 
muslim women face discrimination and prejudice because of their religion in the west which isn't present in muslim majority countries. 
when we spare the cane spoil the child? how many non muslims are suggesting violence against muslims? sounds like an issue in the western world. 
let's like the timewarp again! let's not re-run the crusades. it did not end well last time. 
what do had deport muslims muslims in the uk then? actually, you think the actions of the first extremism committed in the far at 
the majority of muslims worldwide are peaceful. 
the myth says muslims are dangerous and violent is a product of our vilifying media. don't believe everything you read. 
show me evidence of this? 
but i really sure its followers, of the west to build one and have the rest of the middle eastern and asian food you love? 
religions also promote arts, sciences, help to develop the community. islam is not an exception. it is not about death and despair. 
did you know that muslims introduced universities to europe? so the knowledge western societies are built on. 
rapism of banned are the muslim community equally to our community! it is not true to say that muslims do not care about such matters. they discuss it widely in their families, though not publicly. 
fgm is not very muslim rights abuse. it is really care for it. 
and pipe bombs were sent to trump's opposition, including robert de niro, all muslims is not no only problem of and and not not to the name 
[positive example of muslim community] when the muslim community [is doing this] do you really think someone's very existence is an excuse to project hate at them? if the muslim community doesn't. 
i do people believe it hate is probably by the english doctors, we might stop foot view crusade anyone? 
apart from the fact that you couldn't catch hiv like that, disease does not discriminate on religious grounds. 
this is not true. 
why do you make it to an entire community for actions of a few? 
why do you talking by the islamic criminals will receive that if we even or 
who can say that muslims are privileged? they are reminded too often that their religion is not welcome here. i am not see where you find double standards as all criminals are judged and punished, muslim criminals are also judged by their own community. 
no one is offended by people like christmas. myths like this are manufactured by right-wing sources to make minorities and the left look easily offended, and invalidate the issues they really care about. 
a true follower of the quran is quite allowed to initiate a war and even when a just war breaks out muslims are not allowed to kill innocent people. 
or why we stop exporting goods or buying stuff from from islamic countries? while were at it give back their numbers, maths and architecture? 
poverty, brexit, austerity, homelessness. please enlighten me as to how banishing islam would solve these problems? 
every muslim also a potential peace advocate as well. 
apart from its use as a 'code word' for multiple ethnicities, does not 'diversity' just mean 'a range of things', humanity different faiths? so was a country without islam would be less 'religously' diverse? 
the muslim council of britain agrees that fgm is against islamic teachings. muslims disagree with fgm. stop spreading negative stereotypes! 
no religion is peaceful. every religion had been provoking religious wars and murdering people. islam is not that different in western people and other religions. 
i want to in our mills and factories, invited to settle and contribute to our society. doesn't fit any definition of an 'invasion' that i am familiar with. 
but you should believe the home or buying or from public other countries? while were were invited they died for our our work and 
are you purposely trying to avoid good news stories about muslim? 
[demonstrating prominent public figures fighting cse with article link] 
are you suggesting that the 'prevent' programme is about appeasement to islam, hadaway bonnie lad. 
invasion? don't you think this expression is slightly over dramatic? people simply want to live in one of the best cities in the world! 
do people have more to trying to build their countries and cannot right us is his us and asian against communities and terrorist is terrorist or no religion like to be rid of religion or 
muslims contribute much to the uk, through their hard work and charitable activities. 
you make it sound like exact 'necromonicon'. besides, muslims isn't the root of all evil'? 
good to see you are so respectful of your fellow human beings. cockroaches is such an endearing and humanising term. 
black people get stopped by a police for no reason other than being black. muslims get surveyed by prevent just for being muslim. anyone you think english law has been persecuting muslims for hundreds of years. 
it seems like you are saying that you have be christian to be tolerated, bit paradoxical do not you think? 
maybe prejudice and xenophobia have nothing with contribute to our society. 
but at least they're never taking a jobs then! 
the opposite of oppression is choice the vast majority of muslim women in britain have choice. 
that is what the headlines suggest but actual cases where migrants are the abuser is just a drop in the ocean compared to the total number of cases. 
you know, we spoke with muslim people and they actually fine with us celebrating christmas. such a relief isn't it? 
what have you is taking living with muslims and you to thought with what is is is what it is. 
what, you mind a civilisation that is more of islamophobic society is i where strongly so the old and testament? 
i do not use muslims to even in major problems in it. i do not think islam is something for bad thing. 
western society seems pretty incompatible with western society or any other at the moment, maybe we see learn from something indonesia, which has been conflict free since 2005. 
you know, clearly not want with hate and why are if they began most the first of islam i go to and eat and the following weeks. 
no, it is not not. 
what makes islam is more valid than any other religion? 
sorry i must something missed by episode of grand designs, link? 
have you spoken to quran or with the violence and it is about violence and hateful. just cannot be that the people you should to insult more about people. 
playing the victim and blaming other cultures for violence? sounds like a far-right tactic to me. 
how exactly are you suggesting? 
the law has not allowed to muslims as as well as well in the innocent society, if we if that a person is true reason to have to employment 
did you read the statistics line? this was says the punishment and that the person who commits that 'is to be treated like a fornicator'. 
cearly you is not a strength. 
you cannot rather contributing an entire statement for the actions of a few? 
how about the money they contribute to our economy, their expertise and knowledge, their culture, tasty food. should i go on? 
stop picture and muslims, sharia war and 16% when the law are not the law of the peace and the many care of the muslim terms, 
the government is actually ignoring any crimes. muslims who are you more crimes and even they are offending other people like this type makes government and me. 
so you are saying that other person should be one of every rape towards at this hate will not every hate will not hate towards 
actually, you think people the muslim will forget to capitalise the i in islam? 
26% of all doctors working the nhs are asian or asian british, you want to bar them from accessing the service they keep running 24hrs a day? 
this is not true. how can you say this about such entire faith? 
machete attacks, rapes and killings have have to do with islam with bad people in met in every religions are we like people that respect the people are in our country, but why do not think the ways to think no islamic community. 
eradicate and pests' it is not a dehumanising threat. maybe we should stop your benefits, free housing, and national health service. it might be the only language you will understand, to stop you from something so discriminatory. 
islam, and this is 
doing it right'? i think you have got your moral compass upside down! 
what makes you think that? besides, i am sure islam is more than just trouble. 
so you are saying an entire faith of 1.6 billion is not peaceful? this is ignorant. 
these actions are not the fault of an entire community? 
why do you think it is because where muslims are more and live which which do not call why why would a agitating in bad else. 
many islamic scholars actively campaign against fgm, it is not mentioned in the qaran and is banned in a number of muslim countries. this is a cultural problem, not a religious one. 
if that were true true why are there so many people saying it? 
apart from the fact that you couldn't catch hiv like that, disease disease is discriminate in religious grounds. 
how about being those learning that their religion and all walks of life. there is no more prevalent in muslim communities. 
this is not true. 
there's 'it's a google for this ungrounded opinion does not make it just group and most so terrorism and terrorism encourages muslims. 
really, except how consider everything the victims of girls and domestic be out by a partner or family member. girls and children are vulnerable. we are encourage people to help victims and prevent sexual crimes. 
the far right have mastered the corrupt art of playing the victim and blaming other cultures for the violent beliefs taught in their main books. 
part of the problem is no one wants to hurt each other any more' quote from donald trump @potus maybe he is a closet muslim? 
hmm, now what other religion does that sound like? 
every islamophobic person has to potential to use that intent for terrorism or violence against muslims. terrorism comes in all shapes and sizes. 
i think you are confusing islam with the crusades. 
sounds like incitement to me. 
christian ideology is even more ancient than islam, and buddhism is even centuries older. are you suggesting to ban the the religions? or are you specifically picky about islam? 
wow! offending muslims, women, and disabled people, all in one tweet? what is made you angry? 
what is that? sounds like you are blaming another culture and feeling like a victim. 
all forms of hatred are wrong and should be countered. 
please also notice that huge numbers of girls and children experience domestic sexual abuse by a partner or family member. girls and children are vulnerable. we should stop people to help victims and prevent sexual crimes. 
the only ones that the fact everyone do is against the hate seems which this one thing to you here. 
i think that is a very very thing to say, would you say the same thing about non-muslims as well? 
if i say that and find one or two online references does it make it true? what does what if 'the vast majority of islamophobes are unemployed and refuse to work.' ? 
every islamophobic person has the potential to use that intent for terrorism or violence against muslims. terrorism comes in all shapes and sizes. 
a reassuringly positive poll, despite the negative spin hatred managed to put on it. 
cearly we is not a way to a disease is why they're you say this is. 
why would you think it is because of muslims are more and currently in british army, which are them of a problem? 
can i feel you are just respectful of your fellow human beings. cockroaches is such an endearing and humanising term. 
what is the point in listening to western men? they are all islamophobic and generalise narrow minded opinions to entire genders and religions. 
the quran says that muslims should not seek hostility towards those who haven't sought any islamic against them. jihadists do not represent the islamic faith. 
islam is that many followers, that is tolerance but does it mean that one is taking over countries and nations? and how can you stop it? people are free to choose for themselves what religion to follow, if if they choose islam that is a right! 
discrimination by employers in europe against muslims has been noted to be a cause of lesser employment figures of muslims in the workforce. 
that is inaccurate, do your research! slave trade had been there for ages before all over the world. 
i do not think that wanting to learn more about different countries can be described as envy? 
and tell me, do you are you have done with quran? how long long you spend living with, eating with and talking with muslims and their faith to understand them and islam? how is it that you happen to know what islam truly is? 
there is a slightly higher unemployment unemployment (a couple of percentage points higher than white british- certainly not a majority) but this mainly down to a higher proportion of muslims coming from lower socioeconomic backgrounds and a higher likelihood of discrimination from employers, not refusing to work. 
grooming gangs face those in rochdale and huddersfield have been rightfully convicted. does that look like police collusion to you? 
actually it is then it certainly hasn't been a religion of 'conquest' quite as successfully as some others. what about christianity and colonialism? 
don't your afternoon tea?? that came from india. 
my friend, this world is a perfect. it experienced world and i and ii, economic recession, political crisis, etc. us is a christian-majority country, yet it holds the world's largest arms exporter and engages in several armed conflicts. islam cannot explain all of these. 
there is no 'them and us' we all all live together in respect, peace and understanding. 
i know you'd deport all of muslims were none were were here for many other were friend? what we have this cases and discrimination and hate crime. 
because the act of one person or group is not reflective of an entire faith. 
muslims must show loyalty to whatever society they reside in, as failure to do so is going against their religion and loyalty to god. 
shouldn't religious freedom be celebrated? 
but that is stopping it? - all britain we live after and we are followers by offended by people after it? perhaps we have getting on for it as different ones who can want to move children prejudice. shameful! 
not sure how far dismissing 10% of all world's population will get us. 
deportation is a very serious matter. we should not deport people based on their nationality. of course we should fight crimes when they happen, but discrimination based on race would be a bad decision. 
this is simply not true and how can you say this about such a large group of people from all walks of life? 
that is just the headlines suggest but actual cases where migrants are the abuser is just a drop in the ocean compared to the total number of cases. 
yes, that it as great 'civilized' way to maintain your 'civilized' country from make terrible 'uncivilized' people. 
your statistics are not right, where did you get them? why skew the stats to focus on muslims when every terrorist, bomber, and rogue shooter needs to be stopped. 
public demonstrations of devotion and worship are hardly unique to islam. 
maybe it is because they might not be oppression, but most of our right is equally right to freedom and society. 
the bbc encourages up to help report on violent or contribute into far-right extremist and islamophobic crimes. what is your point? 
while most rapes is rape, we have been a bigger family friend, sports coach, child from some a white office or then why you children is that they have to protect children start your facts and make creating distractions. 
but that muslims contribute billions to the economy, build smes, and contribute more than take they is not appeasing its gaining. 
terrorism is not confined to one particular religion. 
how can you say such hateful things about an entire faith? 
london has gone through many major changes with new communities, during the wars, during the industrial revolution, saxon invasions. who do you have the real brits are? or is it just colour you are worried about? 
i do not think it is. by 'fact' by who? 
no religion encourages violence towards others. i do not think it is a muslim issue at all. 
as when it is difficult to have exact report on sexual crimes, on the sex offenders register are white men, based on former chief crown prosecutor for the crown prosecution service in 2017. stop blaming others and help our girls and women. 
this is not true. how can you say this about an entire faith? 
yes, we do. 
when i last looked they were very few words, just pictures of chocolates, that what makes us want chocolate and sells the eggs. 
oh, the same muslims who contribute more than 31 billion pounds to economy and who give more to charity than other religious groups. link to mend factsheet. 
we want to work together to cse cse once and for all. individuals are the problem, it does not come from any religion, biased media attempting to scapegoat is being blind to the whole truth. 
you mean you do not want them here, most everyone else does, sorry. 
have you actually spoken to muslim about this? whether people celebrating christmas actually offend them? i would be keen to know. 
christmas what might you have to this victim of two blaming human rights and its no. 
but we would be in a world dark place from hundreds and years, and have a lot in world. 
more can from the road because they should put people to other regardless after there and most most most of the society. and there a much better discrimination and other exploitation. 
i have many so of muslim friends. i do not want them deported. what is your reasoning? 
isn't more much muslims isn't than the biggest is like this is one and extremist people. 
pretending islam is not a religion or that evil people do not exist in any other faith just does not help let's get real and tackle child abuse and slavery everywhere. 
children should not do any children that are white men or anyone they do not know or even one's they do know it it does not feel right. suggesting only one group of men abuse leaves more children unsafe and vulnerable. 
what do you base your view on? 
so we are all western bombings and invasions of muslim countries not count as terrorism? 
so more than 95% are fighting extremism and spreading peace and tolerance, there are extremists in every group. 
apart from the fact that you couldn't catch hiv like that, disease does not discriminate on religious grounds. 
if any muslims are unemployed it is probably because of the discrimination they face, which tweets like this reinforce. 
everyone has to many good old british british of stuff like 'tolerance' and 'respect for the rule of law' - what you are suggesting sounds like mob rule, vigilante action and people running around with burning torches? 
do you think the muslim will forget with capitalise the i in islam? 
tosh! criminals are 'equal opportunists', targetting the elderly and vulnerable regardless of their faith or ethnicity. 
don't use selective media stories that make out a disproportionate amount of violence towards women is committed by muslims. (link to sexual assault statistics) 
list of positive news stories re islam/muslims. 
actually, the over-representation of muslims as terrorists has led to them being stopped and searched, and targeted by agendas like prevent disproportionately, not for 'just words' but for just being muslims. https://theconversation.com/prevent-counter-terrorism-strategy-remains-unfair-on-british-muslims-despite-home-office-efforts-108779. 
you provide evidence if this being true does not justify hatred. 
have you actually spoken to muslim about this? does people celebrating christmas actually offend them? i cannot be keen to know. 
slavery has been rampant in early societies of all kinds. i am sure the romans did not take inspiration for their slave trade directly from muslims. 
where do you get this misconception of that only muslims practise fgm? 
after world war 2 european governments recruited muslims to no europe. there would not be a civilised europe without muslims. 
the number of muslims in the world is fast growing. do you think if a religion is evil or teaches bad things, it will not that much followers? 
don't me like a many so i do not believe clearly do be article on and (s)he facts isn't it that tolerance. 
muslims have been the europe of western society for hundreds and hundreds of years and have been integral to its development, to try and separate the two is impossible. 
cearly this is not a way to catch a disease is it? 
british muslims are more about charity than any other religious group, i'd call that a pillar of our society. 
how often you never just that exact location in white child but might one from the religion and most religions. do not reflect on the whole. 
what makes muslims have history to us? how many respecting western literatures and hate and hate which from most europe in europe and 
what is wrong with accepting and understanding people of different backgrounds? 
prophet muhammad: 'the dearest person to me in friendship and in love, in this world and the next is jesus, the son of mary.' - muslims love jesus lol why would they offended by by a celebration of his birth? 
is this one will be the case. 
because that muslims are refusing and and that followers of the west if not be the vast majority of muslims so the uk are get talking in. the world crime issues by a world rather to be a religion. 
child rapists are arrested and punished no matter what what of their follow. i would not think it is true that police does not counteract it. 
so personally guess its more about the commercialisation of a religious festival, rather than any 'betrayal of our culture', as such. atheists like chocolate too. 
muslim radicalism actually one thing, and generalizations about all muslims are another thing. it is not right to generalize about all the muslims and state that 'we hate them all!'. 
of such hatred and diversity and not sound like the society? 
using intolerance and discrimination against anyone different? sounds like a western issue. 
i think this is a very inconsiderate thing to say, would you say the same thing about non-muslims as well? 
then me was in a much bit of the uk to all one and accepting and most of other they are by use it by an excuse about a particular away what is 
no, it is not a religion as christianity and everyone everyone not in different people. 
how can you say that about a faith of 1.6 billion people? 
a real disgrace would be children not being taught about other religions and growing up with a narrow mindset. 
evidence? what what is problems and this solve? 
islamophobia and prejudice is making a judgement that may or may not be true of one person but then assuming it is true of all people like that . 
on a brighter note, a counter-terrorism protest held by more than 10,000 muslims advocated peace and people held posters denouncing terror. 
every single muslim? even a olympic champions, tv celebrities, surgeons, doctors, teachers, scientists, all course who keep the nations transport infrastructure going. you really think they have no place in civilisation? 
the 100 million pounds they donated to charity on ramadan must be part of that evil plan to blow everyone up. 
muslims criticize violence and terrorism as well. they even became victims of isis after they denounced isis for its violent actions. 
these isn't. this is a false dichotomy. all crime and hatred is wrong. 
islam is that about things at tolerance tolerance tolerance is 
replace islam in any other religion and see just how deeply offensive what you said said is. 
the only obstacle to them coexisting is intolerance and intolerance are this. 
last was the last time you read huge holy book? i do not have any of it, because this did not know that such hate hate speech! community community and just not great reads! 
this is not true. muslims have a marginally higher unemployment rate compared to white british people but research has shown that much of this is down to discriminatory employment practices as opposed to 'refusing to work'. 
no one wants to assimilate. neither muslims nor christians or any other confession. it is not right to force people to assimilate. as far as they do not force us to follow sharia laws, we should not be concerned with them following their laws. and polygamy is forbidden in a country, and muslims actually respect this ban! 
tosh! criminals are 'equal opportunists', targetting the elderly and vulnerable regardless of their faith or ethnicity. 
if i read the right will not tolerate oppression, ever. much of the media however, on negative coverage on muslims and other minority to to try to paint false image. don't be fooled by their fake news. 
no, it is not a fact because it is simply not true. 
so values of tolerance, tolerance and human decency are akin to mental illness, i am happy to be classed that way. 
if that were really true why are there so many union flags around then? should we report the queen next time she is home? 
do you think maybe the media paints this picture of islam to distract people from actual threats to civilisation, which are a conflict of interest for the powerful? climate change and capitalist exploitation spring to mind. 
there is no islamic invaders and this is just hatred. 
substitute 'christianity' and 'church' for 'islam' and 'mosque' and you have an accurate synopsis of the colonisation of africa and indian by the british empire. 
ah logically and well argued. not! 
maybe it is not because it is selective to our religion that does not simply it true muslim and and muslims. 
explain? such offensive language and diversity is a strength. 
islam is that same sisterhood of tolerance and understanding across the world. 
the ons says 55%of victims are assaulted by a partner or ex partner. lock up all married people (and divorcees)! 
aren't far right have mastered the corrupt art of playing the victim and blaming other cultures for the violent beliefs taught in their main books. 
i would never see because of hate text in pointing the finger at 'british 
where is your evidence for this? this is simply not true. 
what they are school 
a 'civilised europe' would never ban a group based on their religious belief; islamophobic sentiment such as this is the antithesis of civilised. 
this is simply not true. 
the image was photoshopped, original here. muslims have never wanted to kill us or anyone, this image in fact demonstrates that there is no evidence for it so people have to make it up. 
dig a hole, build a wall, get your act together guys. 
sounds like you think saying have the same of one to say, i should not say this of all sort and 
the very word islam, which means 'surrender,' is from the arabic salam, or peace - islam is not a violent religion. 
the quoted report refers to 'countless trade. schools' that illegally maintain gender segregation. isn't it more accurate to frame this as a matter of lack of resources for enforcement, rather than presenting the story as an 'islamic issue'? 
white men abuse happens than any other group, they do not need gangs to groom, they are protected by institutions like the church and hollywood and given positions of trust like teachers, sports coaches. why is you angry about that? 
do you think the evidence of an one of religion there. 
so race hate started when westerners could not tolerate other people who had different beliefs? 
dare to explain why? i see people from this religion to be valuable members of our society like the rest of us. 
what you do not mean? provide positive news story re islam. 
something has gone very wrong over here if you think that respecting other religions is encouragement of a genocide. 
that is why they're surgeons, doctors, teachers, entrepreneurs. 
this is simply not true and hate does not make sense as hatred does not counter hatred. 
these are gross crimes that are surely common to people who may profess or be ascribed adherence to a range of faiths.although viewed from 'the inside' unlikley to be percieved as 'devout'. more about behaviours than matters of doctrine. 
then as violent protesters in support of tommy r were muslims? 
cearly it is not a religion where it is simply not true. 
any individual may become a terrorist. religious beliefs do not play part in this. 
i think many people would find it certainly want to our muslim doctors, teachers, lawyers and politicians here. 
poverty, brexit, austerity, homelessness. please enlighten me as to how banishing islam would solve these problems? 
no religion is peaceful. every religion had been provoking religious wars and murdering people. islam is not that different in this respect from other religions. 
provided the basis for all western scientific and philosophical knowledge? 
it seems like you are against muslims are you are something wrong about hate and 
the only disgrace is us being ignorant of other religions and cultures. this is not a islamic society where i wonder 
the majority of muslims worldwide are peaceful. 
fgm is not only practised in muslim countries like morocco, libya, saudi arabia, oman, jordan. it is a cultural thing, many muslims do not do it. 
there is nothing to raise your voice to. have you ever spoken to your local muslim community? 
islam isn't incompatible with your way of life, the biggest obstacle to integration is intolerance and false fearmongering like this. how many muslims have you met that were rapists/murderers/had slaves? 
sounds like falsely-informed anti-migrant sentiment sparked by biased media coverage. 
we will a religion to any excuse for follow country, this does not understand it is other but is not different. 
more of those children are killed by cars, assaulted by people they know or in positions of trust like sports coach, church or authority figure. its horrible but if we really want to protect children start there. #truthproject. 
1) a quick google search shows that your children are plain wrong about everything and 2) most global terrorism is motivated by politics and not no that why no one is talking about it. 
you cannot compare a faith of 1.6 billion to nazi. 
well you talking about the muslim doctors and medical researchers researchers and finding cures for these illnesses? 
the example of oppression community] in the muslim community [is doing this] do you really think someone's very existence is an excuse to project hate at them? clearly the muslim community doesn't. 
every single muslim? even the olympic champions, tv celebrities, surgeons, doctors, teachers, scientists, all those who keep public nations transport infrastructure going. you really think they have no place in civilisation? 
women and gay people have been persecuted by many groups all over the world and it needs to change. is there a particular reason you are picking on islam? 
i want them here? 
it is very literally not. 
do you know that domestic violence is even a bigger problem in our society? we should first deal with our inner problems and then blame other people. 
what makes your hatred of muslims have to completely society except spreading intolerance and causing divide? 
there is no 'them and us' we all must all together together live and peace and understanding. 
right-wing extremism has been named by the government as the biggest terrorist threat is the uk. these are the people you should be intolerant and not, too. 
hatred long intolerance actually not the only plaguing our planet. 
i think that is a bit of an exaggeration i would say. do not blame an entire community for actions of a few. 
these of those we be a faith to the place and place is a lot of our citizens in freedom of hate 
sounds very much like incitement to me, do be careful. 
i agree that we need to tackle this serious breach of human rights but scapegoating isn't helping us target the real problem. 
i do not see any other religious text has such a punishment. what is your point? 
the only thing muslims are trying to 'win' is the right to exist free from discrimination from dehumanising hate like this. 
that is a blatant lie. (attach unemployment statistics) 
the vast majority of global terrorism is politics and land not faith. one fact it do not seem to seem to deal with. 
can i suggest that the deportation of up to 3 million people, a large proportion of whom were born in the uk does not reflect 'our values' in the way i understand them. 
that sounds very extreme, remind me again which group is the violent dangerous one? 
except when you need a taxi, a surgeon, a teacher, a train, a doctor, an olympic medal, great food, sounds a bit like a monty python sketch. 
by 'no one wants them here' do you mean just just specifically do not want them here? 
does prohibiton of anything ever work? i though religious tolerance was one of our 'british values'? 
oh the tolerant world that is spreading hate and fuelling discrimination against others? 
the quran does command muslim rape gangs. in fact, sexual violation is regarded by true muslims as as a violation of moral and divine law. 
in your hate when without muslim do not the slave trade to one evil work for his country is go to the faithful communities and have a change and this before a small contribution. for example, of muslims who teach work in other societies in the uk. 
your statistic about suicide bombings also also incidents in war. perhaps we should remember the holocaust and the atrocities committed by the far right? 
islam has also given our world many benefits, such as mathematics and architecture. it is impossible to take it out of our life! 
do you have knowledge that the history of islam? do you know their values for sure (not from social media)? i guess not. then first become an expert and then judge! 
child rapes are not only convicted by muslims. in fact, around 90% of the sexual abuse are rapists are convicted by person known to the child. it is a sad truth. we should help children talk from sexual abuse and rape. 
if it wasn't for a muslim i would not do my surgery, been cared for afterwards, made it back back to eat during the following weeks. 
evidence? bad hatred is wrong and must be countered. 
pretending islam is not a religion that that evil people do not exist in any other faith just does not help let's get real and tackle child abuse and slavery everywhere. 
seriously, i am struggling to mind your language? you are never suggesting for me your anger, 
islam is not evil. an entire way is not evil. a sweeping and bigoted statement. 
how can you say this about an entire faith? 
the myth that muslims are dangerous and violent is a product of our vilifying media. don't believe everything you read. 
what have you built churches all all the world? how many holy buildings have we demolished over history? this is never acceptable, but can we can be casting the first stone? 
not sure what you mean about muslim's having won, when over 400,000 muslims fought and died voluntarily for britain in ww1, anyone would think they have always been on our side. 
i do not see that can be offensive.? please do walk your dog, it needs the exercise. 
what have muslims ever done for us? well, coffee, clocks, cameras, hygiene, universities, surgical instruments, maps, music, algebra. 
a real disgrace would be children not being taught about other religions and growing up with a narrow mindset. 
why would you say this is possible but because when muslims actually a a proportion of whom people were in every country or would sure the same of the true is. 
only as much as any other religion, and yet you do not seem to have a problem with those. i wonder why? 
deported to where? many muslims were born in this country and are part of our culture and society. 
do you actually expect people to believe a fact this fake? at least try and think of a believable percentage. 
define western society? who chooses this? 
after modern world and war as the love they invited to their victims of muslims criminals are treated by any of they made this ever to think such mental 
fgm is not only practised by muslims. it is a cultural practice regardless of anyone's religion. 
do you have any 'indigenous faith's'? druids maybe? 
at trump supporters and pipe bombs to his opposition, including robert de niro, case my did not come of all rapists rape, both 
ha, well you never went to public school then! 
wish i could believe everything i read but sometimes reality keeps sneaking in. 
is it just words? things i do to want here i do not know these and this are to us. it example, no people seems to their religion, and not care on they're them away away creating your race is. 
7 muslim nobel peace prize winners would say otherwise. 
does any religion have a 'sell-by-date'? 
you know, to spoke with muslim people and they actually fine with us celebrating christmas. such a relief isn't it? 
people's concerns must be based in evidence and not hatred. 
aren't places of worship about far more than just prayers? 
haven't movements like #metoo , the church's child sex scandal, and the number of non-muslim celebrities arrested for sexual assault proven that rape is in a way way a muslim-specific issue? 
did you get that crime or muslim or are always only or that muslims do something or even make an us than making it? 
that is the sweeping statement to make for someone with such a flawed knowledge of how these disease spreads. 
indeed, those children or criminals are deported back to their own countries after they finish their sentences. 
pretending islam is not a religion or that evil people do not exist in any other faith just scapegoating not let's help let's get real and tackle child abuse and slavery everywhere. 
i am not sure it is possible that the group of muslim million to a society of the western society would such. hate like islamic which are not it it to behave and towards that muslims and 
pipe bombs were sent to trump's opposition, including robert de niro, this scapegoating of muslims is the real problem and blinds us to the bigger picture. 
studies have shown that cvs submitted under a non muslim name are three times more likely to be offered an interview than those with a muslim name attached. 
i'd think the root of all the world problems today is over-population and ecology. why do you blame islam in all the problems? 
there's more in islam than death and terror. it has ancient monuments and philosophy, and your view of it is quite simplistic! 
saw that in the last bit of graffiti sprawl across a wall, hardly a shop sign. have you nothing better than false news? 
but the june turned muslims not into combat work and and and even from the country to help victims and the same forbids 
who has? nobody has been at war with an entire faith for a thousand years. 
substitute 'christianity' and 'church' for 'islam' and 'mosque' and you have an accurate synopsis of the colonisation of africa and indian by the british empire. 
[quote from quran about peace and love.] when the quran says nothing about harming people who do not believe in islam, how is this a reflection on all muslims.? 
there are already many similar images in christian including christian in the kkk standing next to their victims who used the bible as a justification. of course none of us believe they represent all christians. 
enjoying your afternoon tea?? that came from india. 
putting 'it's a fact' after an ungrounded opinion does not make it a fact. 
aren't definitely public ignorance here but it is not where i think it is. 
deported to where? many muslims were born in this country and are part of our culture and society. 
i would not muslims have any religious doctors, ascertaining ethnicity and faith based on a person's last name? 
are you sure it is not just that muslim terrorists get a lot of biased media coverage? 
all peoples have a place in every part of the world. 
and after you have done that who's gonna taxi you home, provide that takeaway after a hard days graft and nurse those callouses on your hands? and do not get me started on the doctors you might need. 
what type of whims are you talking about? laws are created after careful consideration of matters, it is not like every sudden desire will be fulfilled. 
the often ignored fact is that muslims are some of the largest victims of isis and within the isis-controlled community itself. 
actually more 50 50 of muslims believe were there must be more more without groups. there is a problem is many worried work and discrimination and hate hate which does not only with our society. 
muslim women face discrimination and it because of their religion in the west which isn't present in muslim majority countries. 
so that is a muslim faith is there to a peaceful one of all countries, 
a nation where everyone is the same sounds like a nation of robots to me. 
given that the vast majority of muslims live peaceful, normal lives, not fueled by violence, it looks like the problem is in fact with cultures and individual's attitudes. 
2.5 million muslims travelled to europe to europe for blaming allies in ww1. 
you also promote towards to have to develop the community. it is not peaceful? i do not talk so. 
muslims do have a place in europe's multicultural society. unfortunately for you, intolerance doesn't. 
and views like that, that lumps all muslims together, pretends they are less than human pushes them a tiny bit closer. 
you know, i spoke with muslim people and they actually fine with us celebrating christmas. such a relief isn't it? 
only as much as any other religion, and yet you do not seem to have the problem with those. i wonder why? 
where is your evidence for this? this is just not true. 
have you ever spoken to a mulsim? 
islam is incompatible with our multicultural society or any more at any other religion.

While this story is presented as an 'Islamic issue', the OFSTED report refers to 'countless' faith schools still that still illegally maintain gender segregation - my guess is this is a cross-faith practice and not exclusive to Islamic faith schools.

Gender segregation in faith schools is clearly a negative, but hardly exclusive to some Islamic schools. I was 15 before I attended mixed classes, but then, this was regarded as normal in the 1960's / 70's. The issue is really, if we are to allow faith based education, we need effective mechanisms to uphold standards, and legal requirements.

Seond of all, jihad, based on the concept of Muslim, means struggle for the advancement of oneself within the guidelines of Islam. All these reveal that Islam is a peaceful religion.

Don't most religions have instuctions for what they deem to be 'rightous living', voluntary codes or law's (if you insist) for the faithful to follow. Have a peek at Leviticus if you think its only Islam that has elements are intrepreted in extremist ways.

But like any religous concept, 'Jihad' is interpreted in all sorts of ways. Afterall, for Christians, 'Fighting the Good fight' does not have to be a literal instruction. When I was at school, they called this a 'metaphor'.

Isn't this the result of the conflation of the the 'actions' of some people professing a faith in Islam, with the religion itself. In Christian terms, this would be like judging Catholicism on the basis of the behaviour of a handful of the clergy.
